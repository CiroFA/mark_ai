April 2024 final decision to regulate broadband services via utility-style common carriage regulation under Title II of the Communications Act. Absent further action in the courts, this decision will remain in effect and limit the risk of burdensome FCC broadband regulation. In addition to federal activity,  several states have adopted or are considering adopting laws or executive orders that would impose net neutrality and other requirements on some of our broadband services, including a law in New York that requires discounted broadband pricing for low income customers. Some states may also impose pricing or other rules related to broadband built with the assistance of federal or state funding. The FCC also adopted broad rules related to "digital discrimination" that could further increase regulatory oversight of broadband services; industry groups have appealed those rules in court.

"Open access"
– We hold certain wireless licenses that require us to comply with so-called "open access" FCC regulations, which generally require licensees of particular spectrum to allow customers to use devices and applications of their choice. Moreover, certain services could be subject to conflicting regulation by the FCC and/or various state and local authorities, which could significantly increase the cost of implementing and introducing new services.

Climate-related regulation and policy
– Due to the nature of our operations, we have been, and expect to continue to be impacted by regulatory developments related to climate change, including, for example, the direct regulation of greenhouse gas emissions or carbon policies that could result in a tax on such emissions. In addition, policy-driven changes in the prices of fuel or energy in geographies in which we operate could make it more expensive for us to purchase energy to power our networks and data centers, and any increase in taxes on fuel could increase our costs associated with operating those vehicles in our fleet that are dependent on traditional fuels.
These developments and the further regulation of broadband, wireless, and our other activities and any related court decisions could result in significant increases in costs for us or restrict our ability to compete in the marketplace and limit the return we can expect to achieve on past and future investments in our networks.
Our business may be impacted by changes in tax laws and regulations, or their interpretations, and challenges to our tax positions.
Tax laws and regulations are complex, dynamic, and subject to change and varying interpretations, especially when evaluated against new technologies and telecommunications services. In addition, tax legislation has been introduced or is being considered in various jurisdictions that could significantly impact our tax rate, tax liabilities, and the carrying value of deferred tax assets or deferred tax liabilities. Any of these changes could materially impact our financial performance and our tax
