Note 6—Fair Value Measurements and Investments
Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis
Level 1 assets and liabilities.
Money market funds, U.S. Treasury securities and marketable equity securities are classified as Level 1 within the fair value hierarchy, as fair value is based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. The Company’s deferred compensation liability is measured at fair value based on marketable equity securities held under the deferred compensation plan.
