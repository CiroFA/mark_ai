applicable pediatric exclusivity) or earlier under certain circumstances. The Company agreed to stay the lawsuit filed against
two
generic companies, which in exchange agreed to be bound by a judgment on the merits of the consolidated action in the District of New Jersey. One of the generic companies in the consolidated action requested dismissal of the action against it and the Company did not oppose this request, which was subsequently granted by the court. The Company does not expect this company to bring its generic version of
Bridion
to the market before January 2026 or later, depending on any applicable pediatric exclusivity.
In February 2024, the Company received another Paragraph IV Certification Letter under the Hatch-Waxman Act notifying the Company that Hikma Pharmaceuticals USA Inc. (Hikma) had filed an application to the FDA seeking pre-patent expiry approval to sell a generic version of
Bridion
Injection. In March 2024, the Company filed a patent infringement lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey against Hikma, postponing FDA approval of the Hikma generic drug for 30 months or until expiration of the sugammadex patent (January 27, 2026) and any potentially applicable pediatric exclusivity or an adverse court decision, if any, whichever may occur earlier. Expiration of the patent, and any potentially applicable pediatric exclusivity, will occur earlier than expiry of the 30-month stay. On April 16, 2024, the district court stayed the case during the pendency of the Federal Circuit appeal noted above.
Januvia, Janumet, Janumet XR
—
As previously disclosed, the FDA granted pediatric exclusivity with respect to
Januvia
(sitagliptin),
Janumet
(sitagliptin/metformin HCl), and
Janumet XR
(sitagliptin and metformin HCl extended-release), which provides a further six months of exclusivity in the U.S. beyond the expiration of all patents listed in the FDA’s Orange Book. Adding this exclusivity to the term of the key patent protection extended exclusivity on these products to January 2023. However,
Januvia
,
Janumet
, and
Janumet XR
contain sitagliptin phosphate monohydrate and the Company has another patent covering certain phosphate salt and polymorphic forms of sitagliptin that expires in May 2027, including pediatric exclusivity (salt/polymorph patent).
As previously disclosed, beginning in 2019, a number of generic drug companies filed ANDAs seeking approval of generic forms of
Januvia
and
Janumet
along with paragraph IV certifications challenging the validity of the salt/polymorph patent. The Company responded by filing infringement suits which have all been settled. The Company has settled with a total
26
generic companies providing that these generic companies can bring their generic versions of
Januvia
and
Janumet
to the market in the U.S. in May 2026 or earlier under certain circumstances, and their generic versions of
Janumet XR
to the market in July 2026 or earlier under certain circumstances.
