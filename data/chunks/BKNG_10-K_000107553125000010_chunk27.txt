reduce our market share and harm our financial performance.
We compete globally with online and traditional travel and restaurant reservation and related services. The markets for the services we offer are intensely competitive and constantly evolving. Current and new competitors launch new services at a relatively low cost. Some of our current and potential competitors include the largest global technology companies, which have significantly more consumers, consumer data, and resources than we do, and may be able to leverage other aspects of their businesses (e.g., search or mobile device businesses or Gen AI and similar or related capabilities) to compete with us. For example, Google's online travel offerings have grown rapidly by linking travel search services to its dominant search functionality through flight, hotel, and alternative accommodations meta-search products, and integrating such products into Google Maps. Similarly, several companies developing Gen AI-powered platforms have used travel search and reservation capabilities to illustrate the possible use cases for this technology. The structure of the travel industry or consumer preferences could also change in ways that disadvantage us and benefit competitors or new entrants. If we are unable to successfully adapt to such changes, our ability to compete, and our business and results of operations, would be adversely affected.
We currently, or may in the future, compete with companies that provide a variety of products and services, including:
•
online platforms, including accommodation and alternative accommodation search or reservation services, travel meta-search, and large online companies including in search, social media, marketplace, Gen AI, and ride-sharing;
•
travel service providers (e.g., accommodations, rental car companies, or airlines), which may offer lower prices on their direct channel than they provide to us;
•
traditional travel agencies, travel management companies, wholesalers, and tour operators;
•
companies offering software solutions and technology services to travel service providers, including global distribution systems ("GDSs") and hospitality software and payments platforms; and
•
companies offering AI agents powered by Gen AI that can perform or facilitate travel-related services, such as virtual assistants.
Some of our current and potential competitors may have greater resources or stronger competitive positions in certain geographic regions than we do. For example, some of our competitors may be domiciled in different countries and subject to political, legal, and regulatory regimes that enable them to compete more effectively than us.
The market for accommodations covers a wide range of property types including alternative accommodations, and companies like Airbnb and Vrbo (owned by Expedia) compete directly with our accommodations businesses. Meta-search services may lower the cost for new companies to enter the market by providing a distribution
