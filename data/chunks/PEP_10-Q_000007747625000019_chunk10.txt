Basis of Presentation and Our Segments
Basis of Presentation
When used in this report, the terms “we,” “us,” “our,” “PepsiCo” and the “Company” mean PepsiCo, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries, collectively.
The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) for interim financial information and with the rules and regulations for reporting the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (Form 10-Q). Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. We have subsidiaries operating in highly inflationary economies, such as Argentina, Egypt and Turkey, and accordingly apply highly inflationary accounting for these subsidiaries. The condensed consolidated balance sheet at December 28, 2024 has been derived from the audited consolidated financial statements at that date, but does not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. These financial statements have been prepared on a basis that is substantially consistent with the accounting principles applied in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 28, 2024 (2024 Form 10-K). This report should be read in conjunction with our 2024 Form 10-K. In our opinion, these financial statements include all normal and recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation. The results for the 12 weeks ended March 22, 2025 are not necessarily indicative of the results expected for any future period or the full year.
