Supplier
finance programs
The Company and certain financial institutions participate in a supplier finance program (“SFP”) that enables certain of the Company’s suppliers, at their own election, to request the payment of their invoices to the financial institutions earlier than the terms stated in the Company’s payment policies. Suppliers’ voluntary inclusion of invoices in the SFP does not change the Company’s payment terms, the amounts paid or liquidity. The supplier invoices that have been confirmed as valid under the program require payment in full according to the terms established in the Company’s payment policies (a range of
60
and
90
days from the invoicing date). There are no assets pledged as security or other forms of guarantees provided for the committed payment to the financial institution. The Company has no economic interest in a supplier’s decision to participate in the SFP and has no financial impact in connection with the SFP.
As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the obligations outstanding that the Company has confirmed as valid to the financial institutions amounted to $
425
million and $
381
million, respectively, and are included in the consolidated balance sheets within
accounts payable and accrued expenses
line.
The rollforward of the Company’s outstanding obligations confirmed as valid under its supplier finance program for the year ended December 31, 2024 is as follows:
