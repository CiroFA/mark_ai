Endpoint Security:
Endpoints are the critical last line of defense against cyber attackers. Our Symantec and Carbon Black endpoint security solutions prevent, detect and respond to emerging threats across all devices and operating systems including laptops, desktops, tablets, mobile phones, servers and cloud workloads through an AI driven security console and single agent.

Network Security:
Email and web access are the lifeblood and essential communication means for every modern organization. We have a full array of network security solutions, as well as a shared set of advanced threat protection technologies to stop inbound and outbound threats targeting end users, information and key infrastructure.

Information Security:
Information protection and compliance is critical to managing risk. We offer integrated information security solutions, based on an efficient, single-policy that can be applied across the entire environment, to help organizations identify and protect risky users, applications and their most sensitive data everywhere across endpoints, on-premises networks, cloud services and private applications.
•
Application Security:
Applications are increasingly targeted by cyber attackers. Our solutions secure critical systems, prevent unwanted changes, and ensure continuous compliance with regulatory mandates. Carbon Black solutions employ a positive security model that secures often overlooked use cases such as end-of-life operating systems, critical systems, fixed function devices, and air-gapped systems.
•
Identity Security:
User identities are under attack by cyber criminals hoping to exploit their access and privileges and do harm. Our solution mitigates these attacks by positively identifying legitimate users, enforcing granular access control policies, and streamlining access governance to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive resources and data.
