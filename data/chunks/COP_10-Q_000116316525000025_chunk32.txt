averaged $71.42 per barrel in the first quarter of 2025, a decrease of seven percent compared with $76.96 per barrel in the first quarter of 2024. Oil prices were lower in the first quarter of 2025 due to higher than expected global oil supplies and elevated geopolitical uncertainties impacting markets.
U.S. Henry Hub natural gas prices averaged $3.65 per MMBTU in the first quarter of 2025, an increase of 62 percent compared with $2.25 per MMBTU in the first quarter of 2024. U.S. Henry Hub prices improved due to cold winter weather and stronger demand. Lower 48 segment realized gas prices improved in the first quarter of 2025 primarily due to fewer third-party pipeline constraints. Volatility in regional markers is expected throughout 2025.
Our realized bitumen price averaged $45.29 per barrel in the first quarter of 2025, an increase of two percent compared with $44.30 per barrel in the first quarter of 2024. The increase in the first quarter of 2025 was driven by narrowing WCS differentials due to increased egress at the Trans Mountain Pipeline Expansion. We continue to optimize bitumen price realizations through enhanced diluent recovery unit operations, blending and transportation strategies.
For the first quarter of 2025, our total average realized price was $53.34 per BOE compared with $56.60 per BOE in the first quarter of 2024.
