During 2022, our AUS increased $77 billion due to the impact of acquisitions (primarily related to the acquisition of NN Investment Partners) and net inflows (across all asset classes), partially offset by net market depreciation (primarily in fixed income and equity assets).
The table below presents information about our total AUS net inflows/(outflows) by client channel.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis
The table below presents information about our average monthly firmwide AUS by asset class.
In addition to our AUS, we have discretion over alternative investments where we currently do not earn management fees (non-fee-earning alternative assets).
We earn management fees on client assets that we manage and also receive incentive fees based on a percentage of a fund’s or a separately managed account’s return, or when the return exceeds a specified benchmark or other performance targets. These incentive fees are recognized when it is probable that a significant reversal of such fees will not occur. Our estimated unrecognized incentive fees were $4.12 billion as of December 2024 and $3.77 billion as of December 2023. Such amounts are based on the completion of the funds’ financial statements, which is generally one quarter in arrears. These fees will be recognized, assuming no decline in fair value, if and when it is probable that a significant reversal of such fees will not occur, which is generally when such fees are no longer subject to fluctuations in the market value of the assets.
The table below presents our average effective management fee (which excludes non-asset-based fees) earned on our firmwide AUS by asset class.
The table below presents details about our monthly average AUS for alternative investments and the average effective management fee we earned on such assets.
