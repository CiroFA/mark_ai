SEPARATION COSTS.
In November 2021, the Company announced its plan to form three industry-leading, global public companies focused on the growth sectors of aerospace, healthcare and energy. As discussed in Note 2, we completed this plan with the spin of GE Vernova in the second quarter of 2024. Post-separation, we expect to continue to incur operational and transition costs related to ongoing separation activities, including employee costs, professional fees, costs to establish certain stand-alone functions and information technology systems, and other transformation and transaction costs to transition to a stand-alone public company. These costs are presented as separation costs in our Statement of Earnings
