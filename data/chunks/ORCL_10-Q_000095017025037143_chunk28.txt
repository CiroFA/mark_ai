$3.3 billion increase in cloud services revenues as customers purchased our applications and infrastructure technologies and renewed their related cloud contracts to continue to gain access to the latest versions of our technologies for which we delivered such cloud services during the periods presented. The increase in cloud services revenues in the third quarter and the first nine months of fiscal 2025 was partially offset by a $239 million and a $172 million total decrease, respectively, in cloud license and on-premise license and license support revenues, relative to the corresponding prior year periods. In constant currency, applications cloud services and license support contributed 23% and 26% and infrastructure cloud services and license support contributed 77% and 74% of the growth in cloud services and license support revenues in the third quarter and the first nine months of fiscal 2025, respectively. The Americas region contributed 74% and 76%, the EMEA region contributed 20% and 17% and the Asia Pacific region contributed 6% and 7% to the constant currency revenue growth for this business during the third quarter and the first nine months of fiscal 2025, respectively.
Total cloud and license business’ expenses increased by $461 million and $1.4 billion in reported currency in the third quarter and the first nine months of fiscal 2025, respectively, relative to the corresponding prior year periods. Excluding the favorable effects of currency rate fluctuations of 2% in the third quarter of fiscal 2025 and less than 1% in the first nine months of fiscal 2025, the constant currency increase in expenses was primarily due to a $399 million and a $961 million increase in infrastructure expenses, an $81 million and a $265 million increase in employee related expenses for employees engaged in cloud services delivery and a $96 million and a $187 million increase in sales and marketing expenses, in each case in the third quarter and the first nine months of fiscal 2025, respectively, relative to the corresponding prior year periods, to support the increase in our cloud services revenues. Our cloud services and license support expenses have grown in recent periods, and we expect this trend to continue during fiscal 2025 as we increase our existing data center capacity and establish data centers in new geographic locations in order to meet current and expected customer demand.
