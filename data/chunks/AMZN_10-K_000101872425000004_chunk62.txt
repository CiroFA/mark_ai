The primary reasons for these transactions were to acquire technologies and know-how to enable Amazon to serve customers more effectively or to expand our customer base.
Pro forma results of operations have not been presented because the effects of the 2024 transactions, individually and in the aggregate, were not material to our consolidated results of operations. Transaction-related costs were expensed as incurred and were not significant.
Goodwill
The goodwill resulting from the acquisition activity is primarily related to expected improvements in technology performance and functionality, as well as sales growth from future product and service offerings and new customers, together with certain intangible assets that do not qualify for separate recognition. The goodwill resulting from the acquisition activity is generally not deductible for tax purposes.
