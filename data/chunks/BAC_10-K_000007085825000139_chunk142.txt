claims against us and other financial institutions, including conduct related to various products, services and markets. The amount of damages, penalties and fines that private litigants, including clients and other counterparties, and regulators seek from us and other financial institutions continues to be significant and unpredictable.
U.S. regulators and government agencies regularly pursue enforcement claims and litigation against financial institutions, including us, for alleged violations of law and client harm, including under
the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act,
the federal securities laws, the False Claims Act, fair lending laws and regulations (including the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act), the FCPA, the BSA, regulations issued by OFAC, Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, antitrust laws, and consumer protection laws and regulations related to products and services such as overdraft and sales practices, including prohibitions on unfair, deceptive, and/or abusive acts and practices (UDAAP) under the Consumer Financial Protection Act and the Federal Trade Commission Act, and EFTA, as well as other enforcement action taken by prudential regulators with respect to safety, soundness and appropriateness of our business practices. Such claims may carry significant penalties, restitution and, in certain cases, treble damages, and the ultimate resolution of regulatory inquiries, investigations and other proceedings which we are subject to from time-to-time is difficult to predict.
In particular, we are the subject of litigation regarding our processing of electronic payments through the Zelle network,
our efforts to detect, prevent and address fraud perpetrated against our clients and/or the handling of fraud-related disputes, which could result in fines, judgments and/or settlements, and adversely affect our businesses and strategies due to the treatment of loss allocations between clients and us, all of which could also adversely impact other similar products and services. Further, in addition to the consent order referenced above regarding BSA/anti-money laundering and economic sanctions compliance programs, we have
entered into orders or settlements with certain government agencies regarding the rates paid on uninvested cash in brokerage and investment advisory accounts that is swept into interest-paying bank deposits, credit card sales and marketing practices and representment fee practices and our participation in implementing COVID-19-related government relief measures and other federal and state government assistance programs, including the processing of unemployment benefits for California and certain other states. We are subject to, or could become subject to, related litigation or investigations by other regulators with respect to the conduct that gave rise to these orders, or the orders or investigations we become subject to in the future, which may result in judgments and/or settlements.
