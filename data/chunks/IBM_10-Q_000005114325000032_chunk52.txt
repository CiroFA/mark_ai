for additional information on free cash flow. We invested $7,098 million in acquisitions primarily for the acquisition of HashiCorp which completed this quarter and we returned $1,549 million to shareholders through dividends in the first three months of 2025.
Our pension plans were well funded at the end of 2024, with worldwide qualified plans funded at 116 percent. Overall pension funded status as of the end of March 2025 was fairly consistent with year-end 2024. We expect contributions for all retirement-related plans to be approximately $1.3 billion in 2025, essentially flat compared to the prior year.
IBM Working Capital
Working capital decreased $1,109 million from the year-end 2024 position. Current assets increased $854 million ($358 million adjusted for currency) primarily due to an increase in cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and marketable securities; partially offset by decreases in receivables mainly from collections of seasonally higher year-end balances. Current liabilities increased $1,964 million ($1,473 million adjusted for currency) primarily due to an increase in short-term debt driven by reclassifications from long-term debt net of maturities and continued growth in deferred income, reflecting annual customer billings; partially offset by decreases in taxes payable and accounts payable.

Management Discussion – (continued)
Excluding receivables classified as held for sale, the total IBM receivables provision coverage was 1.6 percent at March 31, 2025, an increase of 20 basis points compared to December 31, 2024. The increase in coverage is primarily driven by a decrease in total receivables due to seasonally higher balances at year end and an increase in the unallocated allowance for credit losses on financing receivables. The majority of the write-offs during the three months ended March 31, 2025 were related to receivables which had been previously reserved. Refer to Financing's
