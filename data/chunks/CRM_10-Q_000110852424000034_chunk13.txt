requires management to make estimates and assumptions in the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto.
Significant estimates and assumptions made by management include the determination of:
•
the standalone selling price (“SSP”) of performance obligations for revenue contracts with multiple performance obligations;
•
the valuation of privately-held strategic investments;
•
the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed for business combinations;
•
the recognition, measurement and valuation of current and deferred income taxes and uncertain tax positions;
•
the useful lives of intangible assets; and
•
the fair value of certain stock awards issued.
Actual results could differ materially from these estimates.
