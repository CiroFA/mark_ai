inhibitor being developed and commercialized as part of a collaboration with Eisai Co., Ltd. (Eisai) (see Note 3 to the condensed consolidated financial statements). Lenvima is approved for the treatment of certain types of thyroid cancer, RCC, hepatocellular carcinoma, in combination with everolimus for certain patients with advanced RCC, and in combination with
Keytruda
for certain patients with advanced endometrial carcinoma or advanced RCC. Alliance revenue related to Lenvima increased 1% in the first quarter of 2025 primarily reflecting higher demand in the U.S.
Sales of
Welireg
, for the treatment of adult patients with certain von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease-associated tumors and certain adult patients with previously treated advanced RCC, rose 62% in the first quarter of 2025. Sales growth was primarily due to higher demand in the U.S. reflecting in part continued uptake of the RCC indication following approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2023. In February 2025, the EC conditionally approved
Welireg
as monotherapy both for the treatment of adult patients with VHL disease who require therapy for associated, localized RCC, central nervous system hemangioblastomas, or pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, and for whom localized procedures are unsuitable, and for the treatment of adult patients with advanced clear cell RCC that progressed following two or more lines of therapy that included a PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitor and at least two vascular endothelial growth factor targeted therapies. The EC approval of these two indications is based on results from the LITESPARK-004 and LITESPARK-005 trials. The conditional approval of
Welireg
will be valid for one year, subject to yearly renewal, pending certain additional clinical data. Timing for commercial availability of
Welireg
in individual EU countries will depend on multiple factors, including the completion of national reimbursement procedures.
Reblozyl (luspatercept-aamt) is a first-in-class erythroid maturation recombinant fusion protein that is being commercialized through a global collaboration with Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMS) (see Note 3 to the condensed consolidated financial statements). Reblozyl is approved for the treatment of anemia in certain rare blood disorders. Alliance revenue related to this collaboration (consisting of royalties) increased 68% in the first quarter of 2025 primarily due to strong underlying sales performance, as well a favorable true-up of the previous quarter’s estimated royalty amount.
Vaccines
Combined worldwide sales of
Gardasil
and
Gardasil
9, vaccines to help prevent certain cancers and other diseases caused by certain types of human papillomavirus (HPV), declined 41% in the first quarter of 2025 primarily driven by lower demand in China, partially offset by higher demand in most other international markets, particularly in Japan due to a national catch-up immunization program, and by higher pricing and demand in the U.S. Demand in
