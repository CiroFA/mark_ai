billion, flat when compared with the prior year, reflecting:
•
lower NII in Banking & Wealth Management ("BWM"), predominantly driven by deposit margin compression and lower average deposits,
offset by
•
higher Card Services NII, predominantly driven by higher revolving balances, and
•
the timing impact of First Republic in Home Lending.
Noninterest revenue was $16.6 billion, up 10%, predominantly driven by:
•
higher asset management fees reflecting higher average market levels, including the timing impact of First Republic and, to a lesser extent, net inflows, as well as higher commissions from annuity sales in BWM,
•
higher card income, driven by higher net interchange reflecting increased debit and credit card sales volume, and higher annual fees, partially offset by an increase in amortization related to new account origination costs, as well as
•
higher production revenue in Home Lending, including the timing impact of First Republic.

Noninterest expense was $38.0 billion, up 9%, reflecting First Republic-related expense that was aligned to CCB from Corporate starting in the third quarter of 2023, impacting both compensation and noncompensation expense.
The increase in expense also reflected:
•
higher compensation expense, largely driven by higher revenue-related compensation predominantly for advisors and bankers, and an increase in the number of employees, including in technology, and
•
higher noncompensation expense, largely driven by continued investments in technology and marketing, as well as higher operating losses, partially offset by lower legal expense.
The provision for credit losses was $10.0 billion, reflecting:
•
net charge-offs of $7.9 billion, up $2.6 billion, including $2.4 billion in Card Services, reflecting the seasoning of vintages originated in recent years, credit normalization and balance growth, and
•
a $2.0 billion net addition to the allowance for credit losses, consisting of:
–
$2.2 billion in Card Services, predominantly driven by loan growth, reflecting higher revolving balances, including the seasoning of vintages originated in recent years,
partially offset by
–
a $125 million net reduction in Home Lending, primarily due to improvements in the outlook for home prices in the first quarter of 2024.
The provision in the prior year was $6.9 billion, reflecting net charge-offs of $5.3 billion, a $1.2 billion net addition to the allowance for credit losses, predominantly driven by Card Services, and a $408 million net addition to the allowance for credit losses to establish the allowance for the First Republic loans and lending-related commitments in the second quarter of 2023.
