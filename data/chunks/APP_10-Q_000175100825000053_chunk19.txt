intricately linked to the advertising ecosystem, providing a durable competitive advantage. We generate revenue when our advertisers achieve their return on ad spend targets with our Advertising solutions, ensuring that their success directly fuels our growth.
Since our founding in 2011, we have been focused on building Advertising solutions for advertisers to improve the marketing and monetization of their content. Our founders, who were mobile app developers themselves, quickly realized the real impediment to success and growth in the advertising ecosystem was a discovery and monetization problem—breaking through the congested app stores to efficiently find users and successfully grow their business. Their first-hand experience with these challenges led to the development of our infrastructure and Advertising solutions. We capitalized on our success and understanding of the mobile app ecosystem by entering into the mobile game apps industry in 2018. Our global diversified portfolio of apps now consist of over 200 free-to-play mobile games across five genres, run by ten studios.
For the three months ended March 31, 2025, our revenue increased 40% year-over-year to $1.5 billion, from $1.1 billion in the three months ended March 31, 2024. We generated net income of $576.4 million and $236.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively. We generated Adjusted EBITDA of $1.0 billion and $548.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively. Additionally, our net cash provided by operating activities was $831.7 million and $392.8 million in the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively. We generated Free Cash Flow of $825.7 million and $387.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively. Given our strong financial position, we have been able to reinvest in our expansion and growth, and repurchase and withhold shares of our Class A common stock. See the section titled “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for a definition of Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP.
