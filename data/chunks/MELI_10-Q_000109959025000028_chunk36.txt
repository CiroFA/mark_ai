Our estimated effective tax rate for the three-month period ended March 31, 2025 increased as compared to the same period in 2024, mainly as a result of lower deductions related to tax inflation adjustments in Argentina, partially offset by lower taxable foreign exchange gains accounted for in Argentina for local tax purposes that are not recorded for accounting purposes since, under U.S. GAAP, the Argentine operations’ functional currency is the U.S. dollar due to the highly inflationary status of the country.
