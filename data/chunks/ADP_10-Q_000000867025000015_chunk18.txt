million and
1.2
million shares in the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively, and repurchased
3.4
million and
3.3
million shares in the nine months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively.

Income Taxes
The effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024 was
23.0
% and
23.4
%, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate is primarily due to a benefit for a decrease in uncertain tax position activity and a higher excess tax benefit on stock-based compensation in the three months ended March 31, 2025, partially offset by the benefits of an intercompany transfer of certain assets in the three months ended March 31, 2024.
The effective tax rate for the nine months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024 was
23.1
% and
22.7
%, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate is primarily due to a benefit for adjustments to prior year tax liabilities and a valuation allowance release in the nine months ended March 31, 2024.
