Equity Method Investments:
At March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, PMI had total equity method investments of $
1,117
million and $
1,005
million, respectively.  Equity method investments are initially recorded at cost. Under the equity method of accounting, the investment is adjusted for PMI's proportionate share of earnings or losses, dividends, capital contributions, changes in ownership interests and movements in currency translation adjustments.  The carrying value of our equity method investments at March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, exceeded our share of the investees' book value by $
1,149
million and $
1,060
million, respectively.  The difference between the investment carrying value and the amount of underlying equity in net assets is mainly attributable to equity method goodwill, convertible debt instruments, and definite-lived intangible assets and other assets. The difference related to the definite-lived intangibles and other assets at March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024 of $
151
million and $
152
million, respectively, is amortized on a straight-line basis and is included in Equity investments and securities (income)/loss, net on the condensed consolidated statements of earnings. At March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, PMI received year-to-date dividends from equity method investees of $
15
million and $
151
million, respectively.
