Performance Stock Units
In 2022, the Company began granting performance stock units (“PSUs”) to officers and other key employees subject to
three-year
cliff vesting and pre-established, quantitative goals. Whether any PSUs vest, and the amount that do vest, is tied to completion of service over
three years
and the achievement of three equally-weighted, quantitative goals that directly align with or help drive the Company’s strategy and long-term total shareholder return.
In the first quarter of 2025, the Company had four types of PSU awards: the 2022 PSU awards, the 2023 PSU awards, the 2024 PSU awards, and the 2025 PSU awards. The 2022 PSU grant metrics were focused on relative total shareholder return (“TSR”), year-over-year da Vinci procedure growth for 2023, and two-year compound annual da Vinci procedure growth for 2024. The 2022 PSU awards vested in the first quarter of 2025. The 2023 PSU grant metrics are focused on relative TSR, da Vinci and Ion procedure growth in 2024 compared to 2022, and da Vinci and Ion procedure growth in 2025 compared to 2022. The 2024 PSU grant metrics are focused on relative TSR, da Vinci and Ion procedure growth in 2025 compared to 2023, and da Vinci and Ion procedure growth in 2026 compared to 2023. The 2025 PSU grant metrics are focused on relative adjusted operating margin as compared to selected peers, da Vinci and Ion procedure growth in 2026 compared to 2024, and da Vinci and Ion procedure growth in 2027 compared to 2024.
The TSR metric used in the 2022, 2023, and 2024 PSU awards is considered a market condition, and the expense is determined at the grant date. The procedure growth and relative adjusted operating margin metrics are considered performance conditions, and the expense is recorded based on the forecasted performance, which is reassessed each reporting period based on the probability of achieving the
