The Company closely monitors credit quality for all loans receivable on a recurring basis to assess and manage its exposure to credit risk. To assess merchants and consumers seeking a loan under the lending solution, the Company uses, among other indicators, risk models internally developed, as a credit quality indicator to help predict the merchant’s and consumer’s ability to repay the principal balance and interest related to the credit. The risk model uses multiple variables as predictors of the merchant’s and consumer’s ability to repay the credit, including external and internal indicators. Internal indicators consider user behavior related to credit/payment history, and with lower weight in the risk models, the Company uses number of transactions in the Company’s ecosystem and merchant’s annual sales volume, among other indicators. In addition, the Company considers external bureau information to enhance the model and the decision making process.
