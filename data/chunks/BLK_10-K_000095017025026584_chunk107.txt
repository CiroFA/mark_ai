the price of real assets, commodities or alternative investments in which BlackRock invests on behalf of clients, and BlackRock’s ability to maintain strong investment performance, could impact BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings.
Central banks globally have taken actions to reduce or maintain interest rates, after a rapid rate hiking regime in 2022 and much of 2023, in an effort to moderate inflation. BlackRock’s business is directly and indirectly affected by changes in global interest rates. Changes in global interest rates may cause BlackRock’s AUM to fluctuate and introduce volatility to the Company’s base fees, net income and operating cash flows. BlackRock’s business may also be impacted by governmental changes, as well as potential regulations, foreign and trade policies and fiscal spending that may arise as a result of such changes. See Part I, Item 1A,
Risk Factors
herein for information on the possible future effects of changes in global interest rates and governmental changes on the Company's results.
BlackRock manages $2.9 trillion in fixed income assets, nearly two-thirds of which are owned by institutions for strategic or liability-matching purposes. BlackRock believes it is well positioned for a stabilizing rate environment due to the breadth, diversification and investment performance of its fixed income platform which encompasses active, ETFs and non-ETF index fixed income products, and a range of strategies, including unconstrained, high yield, total return and short-duration.
BlackRock manages $6.3 trillion of equity assets across markets globally. Beta divergence between equity markets, where certain markets perform differently than others, may lead to an increase in the proportion of BlackRock AUM weighted toward lower fee equity products, resulting in a decline in BlackRock’s effective fee rate. Divergent market factors may also erode the correlation between the growth rates of AUM and investment advisory and administration fees (collectively “base fees”) and securities lending revenue.
BlackRock believes its strategy aligns with expected future client demand and structural growth opportunities in areas including private markets, such as infrastructure and private credit; ETFs; whole portfolio solutions including outsourcing and models; and integrated public-private markets enterprise technology through Aladdin, eFront and Preqin upon the transaction’s closing.
BlackRock enters 2025 with strong momentum across its franchise, including its newly enhanced private markets platform. The Company is positioned ahead of market opportunities that it believes will drive outsized growth for BlackRock in the years to come.
