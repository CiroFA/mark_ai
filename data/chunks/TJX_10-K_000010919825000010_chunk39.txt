that may be granted, availability and cost of alternative sources of merchandise, and our buying organizationâ€™s ability to execute our merchandise sourcing model to offset the effects of the tariffs.

Global financial markets can experience volatility, disruption and credit contraction, which could adversely affect global economic conditions. Changes in economic conditions could adversely affect sources of liquidity available to us or our costs of capital, including through capital markets. In particular, prolonged volatility or significant disruption of global financial markets relating to the financial and regulatory environment; interest rate increases following a period of low interest rates; geopolitical conflict; and disruptions impacting traditional banking, could have a negative impact on our ability to access capital markets and other funding sources, on acceptable terms or at all, and impede our ability to comply with debt covenants. In addition, changes in economic conditions could adversely affect plan asset values and investment performance and increase our pension liabilities, expenses and funding requirements and other related financial exposure with respect to company-sponsored and multiemployer pension plans. We rely on banks and other financial institutions to safeguard and allow ready access to assets such as cash and cash equivalents. Our strategies for managing these financial risks and exposures may not be effective or sufficient or may expose us to risk.
