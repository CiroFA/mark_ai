The following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for the pension plan assets. There have been no changes in the methodologies used at December 31, 2024 and 2023.
•
Fair values of equity securities and government debt securities categorized in Level 1 are primarily based on quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.
•
Fair values of corporate debt securities, agency and mortgage-backed securities and government debt securities categorized in Level 2 are estimated using recently executed transactions and quoted market prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets and for identical assets and liabilities in markets that are not active. If there have been no market transactions in a particular fixed income security, its fair value is calculated by pricing models that benchmark the security against other securities with actual market prices. When observable quoted market prices are not available, fair value is based on pricing models that use something other than actual market prices (e.g., observable inputs such as benchmark yields, reported trades and issuer spreads for similar securities), and these securities are categorized in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.
•
Fair values of investments in common/collective trusts are determined by the issuer of each fund based on the fair value of the underlying assets.
•
Fair values of mutual funds are based on quoted market prices, which represent the net asset value of shares held.
•
Time deposits are valued at cost, which approximates fair value.
•
Cash is valued at cost, which approximates fair value. Fair values of international cash equivalents categorized in Level 2 are valued using observable yield curves, discounting and interest rates. U.S. cash balances held in the form of short-term fund units that are redeemable at the measurement date are categorized as Level 2.
•
Fair values of exchange-traded derivatives classified in Level 1 are based on quoted market prices. For other derivatives classified in Level 2, the values are generally calculated from pricing models with market input parameters from third-party sources.
•
Fair values of insurance contracts are valued at the present value of the future benefit payments owed by the insurance company to the plans’ participants.
•
Fair values of real estate investments are valued using real estate valuation techniques and other methods that include reference to third-party sources and sales comparables where available.
•
A portion of U.S. pension plan assets is held as a participating interest in an insurance annuity contract, which is calculated as the market value of investments held under this contract, less the accumulated benefit obligation covered by the contract. The
