favorable terms. We also may be subject to claims from businesses to which we provide these services if we are unsuccessful in implementing, maintaining, or developing these services.
As our agreements terminate, we may be unable to renew or replace these agreements on comparable terms, or at all. We may in the future enter into amendments on less favorable terms or encounter parties that have difficulty meeting their contractual obligations to us, which could adversely affect our operating results.
Our present and future commercial agreements, strategic alliances, and business relationships create additional risks such as:
•
disruption of our ongoing business, including loss of management focus on existing businesses;
•
impairment of other relationships;
•
variability in revenue and income from entering into, amending, or terminating such agreements or relationships; and
•
difficulty integrating under the commercial agreements.
