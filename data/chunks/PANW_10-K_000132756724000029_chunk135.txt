1.7
billion for the U.S. federal indirect tax effect of foreign deferred taxes consistent with our policy to record deferred taxes for basis differences relating to our global intangible low-taxed income. Accordingly, during the year ended July 31, 2024, we recognized a net tax benefit of $
1.7
billion relating to our valuation allowance release. We will continue to monitor the need for a valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets.
As of July 31, 2024, we had federal, state, and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $
46.8
million, $
112.8
million, and $
2.3
billion, respectively, as reported on our tax returns, available to reduce future taxable income, if any. If not utilized, our federal and state net operating loss carryforwards will expire in various amounts at various dates beginning in the years ending July 31, 2034 and July 31, 2031, respectively. Our foreign net operating loss will carry forward indefinitely.
