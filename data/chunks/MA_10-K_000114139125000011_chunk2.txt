Overview
Mastercard is a technology company in the global payments industry.  We connect consumers, financial institutions, merchants, governments, digital partners, businesses and other organizations worldwide by enabling electronic payments and making those payment transactions secure, simple, smart and accessible.  We make payments easier and more efficient by providing a wide range of payment solutions and services using our family of well-known and trusted brands, including Mastercard®, Maestro® and Cirrus®.  We operate a payments network that provides choice and flexibility for consumers, merchants and our customers.  Through our unique and proprietary global payments network, we switch (authorize, clear and settle) payment transactions.  We have additional payments capabilities that include automated clearing house (“ACH”) transactions (both batch and real-time account-based payments).  Using these capabilities, we offer consumer and commercial payment products, capture new payment flows and provide services and solutions.  These services and solutions include, among others, security solutions, consumer acquisition and engagement services, and business and market insights, all of which draw on our principled and responsible use of secure data
.
Our capabilities strengthen, reinforce and complement each other and are fundamentally interdependent.  For our global payments network, our franchise model sets the standards and ground-rules that balance value and risk across all stakeholders and allows for interoperability among them.  We employ a multi-layered approach to help protect the global payments ecosystem in which we operate.
