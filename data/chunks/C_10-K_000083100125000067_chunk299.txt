Administration Matter
In 2016, an arbitration proceeding was commenced in Brazil’s Market Arbitration Chamber against an asset manager of a Brazilian real estate investment fund and Citibank Distribuidora de Titulos e Valores Mob S.A. (Citi DTVM).
The claimant alleged that the asset manager had engaged in fraud in connection with investments in real estate projects and that Citi DTVM, as fund administrator, should be held jointly and severally liable for its investment losses. In 2020, the arbitration panel concluded that the asset manager had engaged in fraudulent activities in certain real estate projects and that Citi DTVM was jointly and severally liable pursuant to the terms of the fund administration contract. The damages phase of the arbitration proceeding is ongoing.
