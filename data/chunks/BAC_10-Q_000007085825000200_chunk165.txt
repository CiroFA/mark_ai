institutions in Afghanistan and activities of international organizations and the U.S. government. 82 of the 85 payments for two BANA clients were processed to Afghan state-owned banks, which are subject to Executive Order 13224. The remaining three payments, on behalf of three BANA clients, were processed to a bank in Yemen that is subject to Executive Order 13224. There was no measurable gross revenue or net profit to the Corporation relating to these transactions, except nominal fees received by BANA for processing payments.
In addition, during the first quarter of 2025, BANA processed 26 payments as an intermediary bank, totaling $146,543, for an entity designated under Executive Order 13224, which was a customer of BANA’s non-U.S. bank client. The payments were processed the day after OFAC’s designation of the entity, and BANA has subsequently disclosed the payments to OFAC. There was no measurable gross revenue or net profit to the Corporation relating to these transactions, except nominal fees received by BANA for processing payments.
The Corporation may in the future engage in authorized transactions for its clients to the extent permitted by U.S. law.
