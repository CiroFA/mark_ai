maintained and therefore cannot be bypassed. It allows our network security platform access to Domain Name System (“DNS”) signatures that are generated using advanced predictive analysis, machine learning, and malicious domain data from a growing threat intelligence sharing community of which we are a part. Expanded categorization of DNS traffic and comprehensive analytics allow deep insights into threats, empowering security personnel with the context to optimize their security posture. It offers comprehensive DNS attack coverage and includes industry-first protections against multiple emerging DNS-based network attacks, including real-time analysis of DNS response to prevent DNS hijacking.

IoT/OT Security.
This cloud-delivered security service uses machine learning to accurately identify and classify various IoT and operational technology (“OT”) devices, including never-been-seen-before devices, mission-critical OT devices, and unmanaged legacy systems. It uses machine learning to baseline normal behavior, identify anomalous activity, assess risk, and provide policy recommendations to allow trusted behavior with a new Device-ID policy construct on our network security platform. Other subscriptions have also been enhanced with IoT context to prevent threats on various devices, including IoT and OT devices.
