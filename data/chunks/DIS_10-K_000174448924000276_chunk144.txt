disclosures.
Disaggregation of Income Statement Expense
In November 2024, the FASB issued guidance that requires the disclosure of additional information related to certain costs and expenses, including amounts of inventory purchases, employee compensation, and depreciation and amortization included in each income statement line item. The guidance also requires disclosure of the total amount of selling expenses and the Company’s definition of selling expenses. The guidance is effective for the Company for annual periods beginning in fiscal year 2028 and for interim periods beginning in fiscal year 2029. The Company is currently assessing the impacts of the new guidance on its financial statement disclosures.
Enhancement and Standardization of Climate-Related Disclosures
In March 2024, the Securities and Exchange Commission adopted new rules that will require disclosure of:
•
Certain climate-related information including climate-related risks, targets, and goals that are reasonably likely to have a material impact, as applicable, on a company’s strategy, business, results of operations or financial condition;
•
Certain greenhouse gas emissions, if material; and
•
Certain financial information regarding the effects of severe weather events and other natural conditions within the notes to the financial statements
The new rules are applicable to annual reporting periods and will be phased in beginning with the Company’s 2026 fiscal year. In April 2024, given pending legal challenges, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued an order to voluntarily stay the new rules.
