observed the project work site to evaluate tangible or physical progress of the project against assumptions used by management in developing its cost and schedule estimates.
•
We tested the accuracy and completeness of the key data used in developing estimates. We developed independent expectations of reasonable outcomes using the program’s data and compared our expectations to management’s estimates.
•
We performed retrospective reviews when evaluating the thoroughness and precision of management’s estimation process and effectiveness of the related internal controls by comparing actual outcomes to previous estimates and the related financial statement impact, and evaluating key judgements made by management when determining the timing of changes to key estimates.
•
We tested the effectiveness of internal controls including, those over significant judgments made and assumptions used to develop key cost estimates, key data used in developing the cost estimates and the mathematical extrapolation of such data.
Program Accounting Estimates for the 777X Program — Refer to Notes 1 and 8 to the financial statements
Critical Audit Matter Description
The Company uses program accounting to compute the cost of sales and margin for each commercial airplane program. However, as the 777X is a developmental program that has not yet delivered any aircraft, there is no cost of sales recorded unless the program has determined that estimated program costs exceed estimated program revenue, resulting in a reach-forward loss. The Company has recognized approximately $3.5 billion in reach-forward losses in 2024. The introduction of new aircraft programs involves increased risk associated with meeting development, certification, and production schedules. The level of effort required to meet regulatory requirements and achieve certification may be challenging to predict, potentially leading to delays in the timing of entry into service and corresponding changes to forecasted costs and revenues. Production disruptions and delays to entry into service for the 777X program have increased the risk associated with forecasted revenue estimates used in determining the program margin, primarily due to the difficulty in assessing the value of consideration expected to be provided to retain customers. Changes to cost estimates related to regulatory requirements for certification and production challenges, as well as changes in estimates for customer consideration could result in material reach-forward losses. Auditing the estimated costs and estimated customer consideration for the 777X program involved extensive audit effort, a high degree of auditor judgment, and required audit professionals with specialized industry experience.
