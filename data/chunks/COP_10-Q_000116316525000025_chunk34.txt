the first quarter of 2025 included lower revenues resulting from lower realized prices of $89 million, partly offset by higher volumes of $22 million. Decreases to earnings included higher DD&A expenses of $22 million. Increases to earnings included lower taxes other than income taxes of $52 million driven by an impact from the settlement of a contingent matter and lower exploration expenses primarily due to absence of seismic work of $26 million from the first quarter of 2024.
Production
Average production increased seven MBOED in the three-month period of 2025. Increases to production were primarily due to new wells online, less downtime and production from our fourth quarter of 2024 acquisition of additional working interest in the Kuparuk River Unit and Prudhoe Bay Unit.
The production increases were partly offset by normal field decline.
Lower 48
The Lower 48 segment consists of operations located in the U.S. Lower 48 states and commercial operations. As of March 31, 2025, the Lower 48 contributed 66 percent of our consolidated liquids production and 73 percent of our consolidated natural gas production.
Net Income (Loss)
Lower 48 reported earnings of $1,790 million in the first quarter of 2025 compared with earnings of $1,381 million in the first quarter of 2024.
Earnings in the first quarter of 2025 included higher revenues resulting from higher volumes of $1,305 million, which included volumes from our acquisition of Marathon Oil. Additional increases to revenues included timing of sales, partly offset by lower overall realized prices of $109 million, driven by lower crude prices. Decreases to earnings in the first quarter of 2025 included higher DD&A expenses of $378 million and higher production and operating expenses of $326 million, primarily from our acquisition of Marathon Oil.
