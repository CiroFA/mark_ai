a further discussion of impacts and risks related to our inventory commitments and our purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers, see “Results of Operations—Product Gross Margin—Supply Chain Impacts and Risks” and, “Liquidity and Capital Resources—Inventory Supply Chain” under Item 7 and Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements of this report.
We expect gross margin to vary over time, and our level of product gross margin may not be sustainable.
Although our product gross margin increased in fiscal 2024, our level of product gross margins have declined in certain prior periods, and could decline in future periods due to adverse impacts from various factors, including:
•
Changes in customer, geographic, or product mix, including the mix of hardware and software
•
Introduction of new products, including products with price-performance advantages, and new business models (including continuing to increase the use of business models where revenue is recognized over multiple periods)
•
Our ability to reduce production costs
•
Entry into new markets or growth in lower margin markets, including markets with different pricing and cost structures, through acquisitions or internal development
•
Sales discounts
•
Increases in material, labor or other manufacturing-related costs (i.e. component costs, broker fees, expedited freight and overtime) or higher supply chain logistics costs, any of which could be significant, especially during periods of supply constraints for certain costs, such as those that have impacted the market for components, including semiconductors and memory in past periods, and which costs have in the past and may continue to be exacerbated by inflation
•
Excess inventory, inventory holding charges, and obsolescence charges
•
Changes in shipment volume
•
The timing of revenue recognition and revenue deferrals
•
Increased costs (including those caused by tariffs or economic conditions, including inflation), loss of cost savings or dilution of savings due to changes in component pricing or charges incurred due to inventory holding periods if parts ordering does not correctly anticipate product demand or if the financial health of either contract manufacturers or suppliers deteriorates
•
Lower than expected benefits from value engineering
•
Increased price competition, including competitors from Asia, especially from China
•
Changes in distribution channels
•
Increased warranty or royalty costs
•
Increased amortization of purchased intangible assets, especially from acquisitions
•
How well we execute on our strategy and operating plans
Changes in service gross margin may result from various factors such as changes in the mix between technical support services and advanced services, as well as the timing of technical support service contract initiations and renewals, the addition of personnel and other related costs, and other resources to support higher levels of service business in future periods.
