Global Trade Environment
––Issued or future executive orders or other new or changes in laws, regulations or policy regarding tariffs, could have a material adverse effect on our business, earnings, cash flows, liquidity and financial guidance. The actual impact of new tariffs on our business would be subject to a number of factors including, but not limited to, restrictions on trade, the effective date and duration of such tariffs, countries included in the scope of tariffs, changes to amounts of tariffs, and potential retaliatory tariffs or other retaliatory actions imposed by other countries. We are evaluating opportunities and developing plans which may help mitigate the potential impact of tariffs on our business and operations. See the
Item 1A. Risk Factors—Global Operations
section of our 2024 Form 10-K.
COVID-19
––In response to COVID-19, we developed Paxlovid and collaborated with BioNTech to jointly develop Comirnaty. As part of our strategy for COVID-19, we are continuing to make significant investments in breakthrough science. This includes continuing to evaluate Comirnaty and Paxlovid, including against new variants of concern, developing variant adapted vaccine candidates and developing potential combination respiratory vaccines and potential next generation vaccines and therapies. We are also evaluating Paxlovid for certain pediatric patients. See the
Product Developments
section within MD&A.
In 2025, for Comirnaty, we expect vaccination rates and market share in commercial markets and revenue phasing similar to 2024, primarily concentrated in the second-half of the year. We have assumed no material U.S. policy changes for our vaccines portfolio in 2025 for purposes of our financial guidance, but see the
Item 1A. Risk Factors—U.S. Healthcare Regulation
section of our 2024 Form 10-K for a description of risks and uncertainties that could impact revenue from our portfolio of vaccines.
In 2025, for Paxlovid, we expect most revenue to be generated through commercial channels. We also expect utilization for Paxlovid to follow infection rates and stable market share, and revenues may fluctuate based on the timing, duration and severity of
