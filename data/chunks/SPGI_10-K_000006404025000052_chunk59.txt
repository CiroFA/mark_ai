Other income, net for 2024 was $25 million, other expense, net in 2023 was $15 million and other income, net for 2022 was $70 million. During 2023 and 2022, lump sum withdrawals exceeded the combined total anticipated annual service and interest cost of our U.S. retirement plan and U.K. plan, respectively, triggering the recognition of a non-cash pre-tax settlement charge of $23 million and $13 million, respectively. Excluding amortization of intangibles from acquisitions in 2024 of $6 million and pre-tax settlement charges in 2023 and 2022, other income, net was $31 million, $9 million, and $83 million for 2024, 2023, 2022, respectively. The increase in other income, net in 2024 compared to 2023 was primarily due to an increase in net periodic benefit cost in 2024 and gains on our mark-to-market investments in 2024 compared to losses in 2023. The decrease in other income, net in 2023 compared to 2022 was primarily due to losses on our mark-to-market investments in 2023 compared to gains in 2022.
Interest Expense, net
Interest expense, net decreased $37 million in 2024 compared to 2023 primarily due to a benefit from our net investment hedge program, reduced expense related to commercial paper borrowings in 2024 and higher interest income from invested cash. Interest expense, net increased $30 million in 2023 compared to 2022 primarily due to the issuance of $750 million 5.25% senior notes in September of 2023 and incremental expense related to commercial paper borrowings.

Loss on Extinguishment of Debt, Net
In 2022, we recognized an
$8 million
loss on extinguishment of debt which includes a tender premium paid to tendering note holders in accordance with the terms of the tender offer of $142 million, partially offset by a $134 million non-cash write-off related to the fair market value step up premium on extinguished debt.
Provision for Income Taxes
Our effective tax rate was 21.5%, 21.2% and 25.1% for 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Fluctuation in tax rates by year is primarily due to tax charge on merger related divestitures and change in mix of income by jurisdiction.
