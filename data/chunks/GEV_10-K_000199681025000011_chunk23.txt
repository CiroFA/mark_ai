plans may adversely affect our delivery of products, services, and outcomes in line with our projected financial performance or cost
estimates, and ultimately may result in excess costs, build-up of inventory that becomes obsolete, lower profit margins and cash flows, and
an erosion of our competitive position.
Significant disruptions in our supply chain, including the high cost or unavailability of raw materials, components, and products
essential to our business, and significant disruptions to our manufacturing and production facilities and distribution networks
could adversely affect our future financial results, and our ability to execute our operations on a timely basis.
Our reliance on third-
party suppliers, contract manufacturers and service providers, and commodity markets to secure raw materials, parts, components, and
sub-systems used in our products exposes us to volatility in the prices and availability of these materials, parts, components, systems, and
services. As our supply chains extend into many different countries and regions of the world, including many developing economies, we are
also subject to global economic and geopolitical dynamics, including tariffs, and risks associated with exporting or importing components
and raw materials for completing the construction or incorporation process in other countries.
We operate in a supply-constrained environment and have faced, are facing, and may in the future face, supply-chain shortages,
inflationary pressures, shortages of skilled labor, transportation and logistics challenges and manufacturing disruptions that impact our
revenues, profitability, cash flow, and timeliness in fulfilling customer orders. To manage the impact of supply chain shortages and
inflationary pressures, we have sought, and may continue to seek, to negotiate long-term agreements with suppliers, develop relationships
with alternative suppliers, drive productivity initiatives in our manufacturing operations, provide training to our employees, develop alternate
transportation routes, modes, and providers, and share rising costs with our customers. While these measures have successfully mitigated
against historical impact, we expect supply chain pressures across our businesses will continue to challenge and adversely affect our
operations and financial performance for some period of time. In addition, some of our suppliers or their sub-suppliers are limited-or sole-
source suppliers, and our ability to meet our obligations to customers depends on the performance, product quality, and stability of such
suppliers. Generally, raw materials and components are available from a number of different suppliers, although we rely on a single
supplier, a small number of suppliers, or suppliers located in a single country for certain materials and components, including for example
some semiconductor chips, cobalt, certain steel, hafnium, and other rare earth metals. We have in the past experienced, and in the future
