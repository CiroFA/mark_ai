A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:
The total amount of federal, state and local, and foreign unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 was
$
325
million
, $
230
million and $
223
million, respectively, exclusive of interest and penalties. During the year ended December 31, 2024, the change in unrecognized tax benefits resulted in a net increase of tax expense of
$
95
million
.
We recognize accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in interest expense and operating-related expense, respectively. Based on the current status of income tax audits, we believe that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits on the balance sheet may be reduced by up to approximately
$
16
million
in the next twelve months as a result of the

resolution of local tax examinations and expiration of applicable statutes of limitations. In addition to the unrecognized tax benefits, we had accrued interest and penalties associated with unrecognized tax benefits of
$
65
million
and $
50
million as of  December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
The U.S. federal income tax audits for 2018 through 2024 are in process. During 2024, we completed state and foreign tax audits and, with few exceptions, we are no longer subject to federal, state, or foreign income tax examinations by tax authorities for the years before 2016. Th
e impact to tax expense in 2024, 2023 and 2022 was not material.
We file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions, and we are routinely under audit by many different tax authorities. We believe that our accrual for tax liabilities is adequate for all open audit years based on an assessment of many factors including past experience and interpretations of tax law. This assessment relies on estimates and assumptions and may involve a series of complex judgments about future events. It is possible that tax examinations will be settled prior to December 31, 2025. If any of these tax audit settlements do occur within that period, we would make any necessary adjustments to the accrual for unrecognized tax benefits.
The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”) introduced an international tax framework under Pillar Two which includes a global minimum tax of 15%. This framework has been implemented by several jurisdictions, including jurisdictions in which we operate, with effect from January 1, 2024, and many other jurisdictions, including jurisdictions in which we operate, are in the process of implementing it. The effect of enacted Pillar Two taxes has been included in the results disclosed and did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. The Company continues to monitor jurisdictions that are expected to implement Pillar Two in the future, and it is in the
