2024
compared to
2023
primarily driven by: higher net income (after
adjusting for depreciation of PP&E, amortization of intangible assets, and (gains) losses on purchases and sales of business interests) of
$1.3 billion
, including the impact of a $0.3 billion cash refund we received in connection with an arbitration proceeding in the second quarter
of 2024; an increase of
$1.7 billion
in accounts payable and equipment project payables,
primarily due to lower disbursements, including a
lower impact related to prepayments compared to the prior year, and higher purchases
; partially offset by a
decrease
in current contract
assets of $(0.5) billion, due to higher revenue recognition, partially offset by an unfavorable change in estimated profitability, in Gas Power;
a decrease in current receivables of $(0.5) billion, primarily due to higher billings, an increase in past dues, and increases in supplier
advances; a decrease in inventories of $(0.4) billion,
primarily due to higher build in Power; and a decrease in due to related parties of
$(0.3) billion, primarily due to settlements of payables with GE prior to the Spin-Off in 2024.
Cash from operating activities of $2.6 billion for the
year ended
December 31, 2024
included a $1.1 billion inflow from changes in working
capital. The cash inflow from changes in working capital was primarily driven by: contract liabilities and current deferred income of $2.8
billion, driven by net collections at Power, and down payments and collections on several large projects in Grid Solutions at Electrification,
partially offset by liquidations and the settlement of a previously canceled project at Wind; accounts payable and equipment project
payables of $1.1 billion, due to material purchases outpacing disbursements,
including an increase in prepayments as we more closely
align the timing of disbursements and collections
; current receivables of $(1.3) billion,
driven
by billings outpacing collections, an increase in
past dues, and increases in supplier advances in order to secure future volume, primarily in Power; inventories of $(0.6) billion, primarily in
Gas Power, to support fulfillment and deliveries expected in 2025, partially offset by liquidations in Wind; current contract assets of $(0.4)
billion, driven by revenue recognition exceeding billings on our equipment and other service agreements in Wind and Electrification, and on
our contractual service agreements in Gas Power, partially offset by an unfavorable change in estimated profitability; and changes in due to
related parties of $(0.4) billion, primarily due to settlements of payables with GE prior to the Spin-Off.
Cash from operating activities of $1.2 billion for the
year ended
December 31, 2023
