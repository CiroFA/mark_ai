2022 Secured Facility.
On October 12, 2022, another subsidiary of Intuit entered into a secured revolving credit facility with a lender to fund the lending products and services we offer to qualified small businesses (the 2022 Secured Facility). The 2022 Secured Facility is secured by cash and receivables of the subsidiary and is non-recourse to Intuit Inc. We have entered into several amendments to this facility, most recently on April 30, 2024. These amendments primarily extend the commitment term and final maturity date and increase the commitment amount. Under the amended 2022 Secured Facility, the facility limit is $
500
million, of which $
300
million is committed and $
200
million is uncommitted. Advances accrue interest at SOFR plus
1.3
%. Unused portions of the committed credit facility accrue a fee at a rate ranging from
0.2
% to
0.4
%, depending on the total unused committed balance. The commitment term is through April 30, 2026, and the final maturity date is April 30, 2027. The agreement includes certain affirmative and negative covenants, including financial covenants that require the subsidiary to maintain specified financial ratios. As of January 31, 2025, we were compliant with all covenants governing the 2022 Secured Facility. At January 31, 2025, $
300
million was outstanding under the 2022 Secured Facility and the weighted-average interest rate was
