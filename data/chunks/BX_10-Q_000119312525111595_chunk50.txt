Blackstone’s net deferred tax assets relate primarily to basis differences resulting from a step-up in tax basis of certain assets at the time of its conversion to a corporation, as well as ongoing exchanges of units for common shares by founders and partners. As of March 31, 2025, Blackstone had a valuation allowance of $
22.3

Blackstone is subject to examination by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other taxing authorities where Blackstone has significant business operations such as the United Kingdom, and various state and local jurisdictions such as New York State and New York City. The tax years under examination vary by jurisdiction. Blackstone does not expect the completion of these audits to have a material impact on its financial condition, but it may be material to operating results for a particular period, depending on the operating results for that period. Blackstone believes the liability established for unrecognized tax benefits is adequate in relation to the potential for additional assessments. It is reasonably possible that changes in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits may occur within the next twelve months; however, it is not possible to reasonably estimate the expected change to the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits and the impact on Blackstone’s effective tax rate over the next twelve months.
