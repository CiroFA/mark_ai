The 2019 Plan is also governed by certain share recapture provisions.  Only shares underlying awards granted under the 2019 Plan that are forfeited, expired, cancelled, terminated, settled in cash or property other than shares, or otherwise not distributable, are added back to the shares available for issuance. Shares withheld to satisfy the exercise price of an award or to satisfy any required tax withholding obligations, or that are repurchased by the Company with option proceeds are not added back to the shares available for issuance.
