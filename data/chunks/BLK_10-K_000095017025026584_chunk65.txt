cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
Geopolitical risks, including those arising from trade tension and/or the imposition of trade tariffs, terrorist activity or acts of civil or international hostility, could have an adverse impact on BlackRock. For instance, the Ukraine-Russia and Middle East conflicts have and may continue to result in geopolitical instability and adversely affect the global economy, supply chains, specific markets and operations. Strategic competition between the US and China and resulting tensions and heightened levels of political polarization have also contributed to uncertainty in the geopolitical and regulatory landscapes. Similarly, other events outside of BlackRock’s control, including the impact of natural disasters, climate-related events, pandemics or health crises may arise from time to time and be accompanied by governmental actions that may increase international tension or impact the US or global economy in ways that are uncertain. Any such events and responses, including regulatory developments, may cause significant volatility and declines in the global markets, disproportionate impacts to certain industries or sectors, disruptions to commerce (including to economic activity, travel and supply chains), loss of life and property damage, and may adversely affect the global economy or capital markets, as well as the Company’s products, operations, clients, vendors and employees, which may cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline. BlackRock’s exposure to geopolitical risks may be heightened to the extent such risks arise in countries in which BlackRock currently operates or seeks to expand its presence.
Climate-related risks could adversely affect BlackRock’s business, products, operations and clients, which may cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
BlackRock’s business and those of its clients could be impacted by climate-related risks. Climate-related risks may impact BlackRock through changes in the physical climate or from the process of transitioning to a low-carbon economy. Climate-related physical risks arise from the direct impacts of a changing climate in the short- and long-term. Such risks may include the risks of extreme weather events and changes in temperature, which may damage infrastructure and facilities, including BlackRock’s physical assets, as well as disrupt connectivity or supply chains. Climate-related transition risks arise from exposure to the transition to a low-carbon economy through policy, regulatory, technology and market changes. For instance, divergent existing and future climate regulations or guidance, as well as differing perspectives of stakeholders regarding climate impacts, have affected and may continue to affect BlackRock’s business activities and reputation, increase scrutiny and complicate compliance requirements.
Climate-related physical and transition risks could also impact BlackRock’s business both directly and
