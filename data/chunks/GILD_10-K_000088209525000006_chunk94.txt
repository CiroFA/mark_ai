Abingworth
In December 2023, we entered into an arrangement with funds managed by Abingworth LLP (“Abingworth”) under which we will receive up to $
210
million to co-fund our development costs for Trodelvy for non-small cell lung cancer in 2023 through 2026. As there is substantive transfer of risk to the financial partner, the development funding is recognized by us as an obligation to perform contractual services. We received $
50
million from Abingworth in 2023 and additional amounts subsequently as incurred. We are recognizing the funding as a reduction of Research and development expenses using an attribution model over the period of the related expenses, with $
78
million of such reductions recorded during the year ended December 31, 2024. If successful, upon regulatory approval in the U.S. for the specified indication, Abingworth will be eligible to receive an approval-based fixed milestone payment of up to $
84
million and royalties based on the applicable net sales.
LEO
Pharma
In January 2025, we entered into a strategic partnership with LEO Pharma A/S (“LEO Pharma”) to accelerate the development and commercialization of LEO Pharma’s small molecule oral signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 (“STAT6”) programs for the potential treatment of patients with inflammatory diseases. Gilead will have global rights to develop, manufacture, and commercialize the small molecule oral STAT6 program. LEO Pharma will have the option to potentially co-commercialize oral programs for dermatology outside the U.S. LEO Pharma will hold exclusive global rights to STAT6 topical formulations in dermatology. Upon closing of the agreement, we made a $
250
million upfront payment to LEO Pharma. In addition, LEO Pharma is eligible to receive up to approximately $
1.5
billion in additional payments and may also receive tiered royalties on sales of oral STAT6 products.
