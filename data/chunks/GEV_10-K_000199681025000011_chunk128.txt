portfolio results given our asset allocation. B
ased on our analysis, we
have assumed a
7.0
%
long-term expected return on the GE Energy Pension Plan assets for cost recognition in
2024
and
2025
.
The healthcare trend assumptions primarily apply to our pre-65 retiree medical plans. Most participants in our post-65 retiree plan have a
fixed subsidy and therefore are not subject to healthcare inflation.
We evaluate these critical assumptions at least annually on a plan and country-specific basis. We periodically evaluate other assumptions
involving demographics factors such as retirement age and turnover, and update them to reflect our actual experience and expectations for
the future. Actual results in any given year will often differ from actuarial assumptions because of economic and other factors. Differences
between our actual results and what we assumed are recorded in AOCI each period and are amortized into earnings over the remaining
average future service of active participating employees or the expected life of inactive participants, as
applicable
