Management’s Discussion and Analysis
Berkshire Hathaway Energy
2024 versus 2023
Our U.S. utilities operate independently in several states, including Utah, Oregon, Wyoming and other Western states (PacifiCorp), Iowa and Illinois (MEC) and Nevada (NV Energy). Net earnings increased $1.1 billion (116.4%) in 2024 compared to 2023. Pre-tax loss accruals, net of expected insurance recoveries, for the Wildfires were $346 million in 2024 and $1.7 billion in 2023. See Note 27 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the Wildfires.
Additionally, net earnings of U.S. utilities in 2024 reflected comparative increases in electric utility margin (operating revenue less cost of sales), income tax benefits from recognized wind production tax credits ($157 million) and other income, partially offset by increases in other energy operating expenses and interest expense.
The U.S. utilities’ electric utility margin was $7.8 billion in 2024, an increase of $274 million (3.6%) compared to 2023. The increase reflected higher retail customer rates in certain territories and higher retail customer volumes, partially offset by higher energy costs and lower wholesale volumes and prices. Retail customer volumes increased 3.6% overall (up 6.5% at NV Energy, 3.1% at PacifiCorp and 1.2% at MEC) in 2024 compared to 2023, primarily due to increases in customer usage and the average number of customers, partially offset by an overall unfavorable impact of weather. The increase in other energy operating expenses was primarily due to higher vegetation management and other wildfire mitigation costs, insurance expenses and general and plant maintenance costs. Interest expense increased $314 million in 2024 over 2023, largely due to increased borrowings, including $4.4 billion of subsidiary term debt issued in January 2024 with a weighted average interest rate of 5.5%.
Net earnings of natural gas pipelines increased $153 million in 2024 compared to 2023. The increase in earnings reflected reductions in earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests, partially offset by the impact of a higher effective income tax rate, due to the acquisition of an additional 50% limited partner interest in Cove Point on September 1, 2023. Pre-tax earnings of the natural gas pipelines in 2024 were unchanged from 2023.
