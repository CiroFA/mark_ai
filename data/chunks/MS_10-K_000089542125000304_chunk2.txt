Forward-Looking Statements
We have included in or incorporated by reference into this report, and from time to time may make in our public filings, press releases or other public statements, certain statements, including, without limitation, those under “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Risk” and “Legal Proceedings” that may constitute “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. In addition, our management may make forward-looking statements to analysts, investors, representatives of the media and others. These forward-looking statements are not historical facts and represent only our beliefs regarding future events, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain and beyond our control.
The nature of our business makes predicting the future trends of our revenues, expenses and net income difficult. The risks and uncertainties involved in our businesses could affect the matters referred to in such statements, and it is possible that our actual results may differ, possibly materially, from the anticipated results indicated in these forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ from those in the forward-looking statements include, without limitation:
•
the effect of market conditions, particularly in the global equity, fixed income, currency, credit and commodities markets, including corporate, commercial and residential mortgage lending, real estate and energy markets;
•
the level of individual investor participation in the global markets, as well as the level and mix of client assets;
•
the flow of investment capital into or from AUM;
•
the level and volatility of equity, fixed income and commodity prices, interest rates, inflation and currency values, other market indices or other market factors, such as market liquidity;
•
the availability and cost of both credit and capital, as well as the credit ratings assigned to our unsecured short-term and long-term debt;
•
technological changes instituted by us, our competitors or counterparties, and technological risks, including risks associated with emerging technologies, business continuity and related operational risks, including breaches or other disruptions of our or a third party’s (or third-parties thereof) operations or systems;
