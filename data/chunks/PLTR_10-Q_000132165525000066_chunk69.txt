to us. Historically, sales to new customers have often led to additional sales to the same customers or similarly situated customers. As we expand into and within new and emerging markets and heavily regulated industry verticals and technologies, we will likely face additional regulatory scrutiny, risks, and burdens from the governments and agencies which regulate those markets, industries, and technologies. While this approach to expansion within new commercial markets and verticals has proven successful in the past, it is uncertain we will achieve the same penetration and organic growth in the future and our reputation, business, financial condition, and results of operations could be negatively impacted.
In the future, we may not be able to secure the financing necessary to operate and grow our business as planned, or to make acquisitions.

•
develop new platforms, products, features, capabilities, and enhancements;
•
continue to expand our product development, sales, and marketing organizations;
•
recruit, hire, train, and retain employees;
