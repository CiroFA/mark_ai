See Note 5 for further information about securities borrowed and loaned accounted for at fair value.
Substantially all of the securities borrowed and loaned within Equities financing are recorded based on the amount of cash collateral advanced or received plus accrued interest. The firm also reviews such securities borrowed to determine if an allowance for credit losses should be recorded by taking into consideration the fair value of collateral received. As these agreements generally can be terminated on demand, they exhibit little, if any, sensitivity to changes in interest rates. Therefore, the carrying value of such agreements approximates fair value. As these agreements are not accounted for at fair value, they are not included in the firm’s fair value hierarchy in Notes 4 and 5. Had these agreements been included in the firm’s fair value hierarchy, they would have been classified in level 2 as of both December 2024 and December 2023.
