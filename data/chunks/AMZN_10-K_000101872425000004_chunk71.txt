decline in the favorable effects of corporate restructuring transactions, and an increase in tax shortfalls from stock-based compensation. This was partially offset by an increase in federal research and development credits, which included approximately $
600
million of tax benefit recorded in 2023 related to a change in the estimated qualifying expenditures associated with our 2022 U.S. federal R&D credit.
Our provision for income taxes in 2024 was higher than in 2023 primarily due to an increase in pretax income, partially offset by an increase in excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation and an increase in our foreign income deduction.

9.9
billion before tax effects and certain of these amounts are subject to annual limitations under applicable tax law. If not utilized, a portion of these losses will begin to expire in 2025.
Income Tax Contingencies
We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. (federal and state) and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. During the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We establish reserves for tax-related uncertainties based on estimates of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. These reserves are established when we believe that certain positions might be challenged despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the outcome of tax audits. The provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate.
