performance by counterparties on
executed derivative instruments. The credit exposure of derivative contracts is represented by the fair value of contracts as of the reporting
date. The fair value of the Companyâ€™s derivatives can change significantly from period to period based on, among other factors, market
movements, and changes in our positions.
We manage concentration of counterparty credit risk by limiting acceptable counterparties to major financial institutions with investment
grade credit ratings, by limiting the amount of credit exposure to individual counterparties, and by actively monitoring counterparty credit
ratings and the amount of individual credit exposure.
We also employ master netting arrangements that limit the risk of counterparty non-payment on a particular settlement date to the net gain
that would have otherwise been received from the counterparty. Although not completely eliminated, we do not consider the risk of
counterparty default to be significant as a result of these protections. Further, none of our derivative instruments are subject to collateral or
other security arrangements, nor do they contain provisions that are dependent on our credit ratings from any credit rating agency.
