During 2024, commercial credit quality deteriorated as reservable criticized utilized exposure increased across a broad range of industries, and nonperforming commercial loans increased primarily driven by U.S. commercial. Commercial net charge-offs increased $1.1 billion to $1.8 billion during 2024 primarily due to higher losses in the commercial real estate office portfolio and U.S. commercial portfolio.
With the exception of the office property type, which is further discussed in the Commercial Real Estate section herein, credit quality of commercial real estate borrowers has remained relatively stable since DecemberÂ 31, 2023; however, we are closely monitoring emerging trends and borrower performance in a higher interest rate environment. Recent demand for office
space continues to be stagnant, and future demand for office space continues to be uncertain as companies evaluate space needs with employment models that utilize a mix of remote and conventional office use.
The commercial allowance for loan and lease losses decreased $152 million during 2024 to $4.7 billion. For more information, see Allowance for Credit Losses on page 72.
Total commercial utilized credit exposure increased $43.2 billion during 2024 to $739.5 billion primarily driven by higher loans and leases. The utilization rate for loans and leases, standby letters of credit (SBLCs) and financial guarantees, and commercial letters of credit, in the aggregate, was 55 percent at both December 31, 2024 and 2023.
