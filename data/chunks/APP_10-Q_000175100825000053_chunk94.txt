We have a substantial amount of indebtedness and our obligations thereunder may limit our operational flexibility or otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
As of March 31, 2025, we had a total of $3.6 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes outstanding (the “Senior Notes”). We also had $1.0 billion of commitments (with a $100 million letter of credit sublimit) under our senior unsecured credit agreement that provides for an unsecured revolving credit facility (the “Credit Agreement”). As of March 31, 2025, we had $200.0 million in outstanding borrowings under the Credit Agreement. We repaid $100.0 million of the outstanding borrowings in April 2025 and the remaining $100.0 million in May 2025.
Our indebtedness could adversely impact us. For example, these obligations could among other things:
•
require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to service and repay the indebtedness, reducing the amount of cash flow available for other purposes;
•
make it difficult for us to pay other obligations;
•
increase our cost of borrowing;
•
make it difficult to obtain favorable terms for any necessary future financing for working capital, capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions and partnerships, debt service requirements, or other purposes;
•
restrict us from making strategic acquisitions and partnerships or cause us to make divestitures or similar transactions;
•
adversely affect our liquidity and result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition upon repayment of the indebtedness;
•
increase our vulnerability to adverse and economic and industry conditions;
•
increase our exposure to interest rate risk from variable rate indebtedness;
•
place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our less leveraged competitors; and
•
limit our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in our business.
In addition, from time to time we have entered into interest rate swap instruments to limit our exposure to changes in variable interest rates. While our hedging strategy is designed to minimize the impact of increases in interest rates applicable to our variable rate debt, including our credit facility, there can be no guarantee that our hedging strategy will be effective, and we may experience credit-related losses in some circumstances. Upon the occurrence of a change of control repurchase event (as defined in the indenture governing the Senior Notes), we will be required to repurchase the Senior Notes at the option of each holder. We may not have sufficient funds to repurchase the Senior Notes in cash at the time of any change of control repurchase event. Upon the occurrence of a change of control (as defined in the Credit Agreement), the lenders thereunder could accelerate the obligations under the Credit Agreement and terminate the commitments
