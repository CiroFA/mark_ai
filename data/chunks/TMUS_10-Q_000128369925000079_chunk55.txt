We anticipate that the remaining deferred licenses from the second tranche of $604 million will close in the second quarter of 2025.
The parties have agreed that each of the closings will occur within 180 days after the receipt of the applicable required regulatory approvals, and payment of each portion of the aggregate $3.5 billion purchase price will occur no later than 40 days after the date of each respective closing.
