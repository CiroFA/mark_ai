Debt
For the periods ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, the carrying value of our outstanding debt was $
1,489
million and $
1,488
million, respectively, net of unamortized debt discount and issuance costs of $
11
million and $
12
million, respectively.
We consider the fair value of the 2030 Notes at December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 to be a Level 2 measurement. The estimated fair value of the 2030 Notes based on the closing trading price per $100, was $
1,247
million and $
1,236
million at December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.
2030 Notes
In August 2020, we issued
1.40
% fixed rate
ten-year
notes with an aggregate principal amount of $
1.5
billion due on September 1, 2030 (the “2030 Notes”). The 2030 Notes were issued at
99.63
% of principal and we incurred $
13
million for debt issuance costs. The effective interest rate for the 2030 Notes was
1.53
% and included interest payable, amortization of debt issuance cost and amortization of debt discount. Interest is payable semi-annually in arrears on March 1 and September 1 of each year, beginning on March 1, 2021, and the entire outstanding principal amount is due at maturity on September 1, 2030. The 2030 Notes are unsecured obligations and the indentures governing the 2030 Notes contain customary events of default and covenants that, among others and subject to exceptions, restrict our ability to incur or guarantee debt secured by liens on specified assets or enter into sale and lease-back transactions with respect to specified properties.
2022 Notes, Note Hedge and Warrants
In May and June 2017, we issued an aggregate of $
782.5
million of
0
% convertible senior notes (the “2022 Notes”), which were converted prior to or settled on June 1, 2022, in accordance with their terms.
To minimize the impact of potential economic dilution upon conversion of the 2022 Notes, we entered into convertible note hedge transactions (the “2022 Note Hedge”) with certain investment banks to purchase
6
million shares for $
128
million with respect to our common stock concurrently with the issuance of the 2022 Notes. The 2022 Note Hedge expired upon the maturity date of the 2022 Notes, which was on June 1, 2022.
Separately, we entered into warrant transactions with certain investment banks, whereby we sold warrants to acquire
6
million shares of our common stock with aggregate proceeds of $
54
million (the “2022 Warrants”). The 2022 Warrants were not part of the 2022 Notes or 2022 Note Hedge. The 2022 Warrants were settled during the quarter ended June 30, 2022 and are
no
longer outstanding.
