South Korea indirect tax charge
–
On July 13, 2023, our South Korean subsidiary, PM Korea, received an adverse ruling from the Supreme Court of South Korea related to cases alleging underpayment of excise taxes in connection with a 2015 excise tax increase and subsequent audit by the South Korean Board of Audit and Inspection. The Supreme Court ruling reversed previous decisions that were in PM Korea’s favor at the trial and appellate levels. As a result of the ruling, we concluded that an adverse outcome was probable. Consequently, we recorded a non-cash pre-tax charge of $204 million (representing $174 million net of income tax or $0.11 per share decrease in diluted EPS) in the second quarter results of 2023, reflecting the full amount previously paid by PM Korea.

Under the terms of the Agreement, PMI paid $140 million in the third quarter of 2023 in return for the termination of the pledge agreement between the parties. As a result, in the third quarter of 2023, PMI recorded a pre-tax charge of $140 million (representing $111 million net of income tax or $0.07 per share decrease in diluted EPS) commensurate with the early termination of the pledge agreement. The pre-tax charge was recorded in marketing, administration and research costs in the consolidated statements of earnings during the year ended December 31, 2023. For further details, see
