Disclosure Pursuant to Section 13(r) of the Exchange Act
Pursuant to Section 13(r) of the Exchange Act, an issuer is required to disclose in its annual or quarterly reports, as applicable, whether it or any of its affiliates knowingly engaged in certain activities, transactions or dealings relating to the Government of Iran or with certain individuals or entities that are the subject of sanctions under U.S. law. Disclosure may be required even where the activities, transactions or dealings were conducted in compliance with applicable law.
In first quarter 2025, the Company identified, as well as blocked and reported to the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), accounts held by certain consumer customers who the Company determined met the OFAC definition of the “Government of Iran” because of their employment at entities owned by the Government of Iran. During the quarter, before the accounts were closed and the funds, if any, were moved to a blocked account, there was some regular consumer activity in
certain
of the accounts, including customer deposits, withdrawals, and payments, and account maintenance activities. The Company’s gross revenue attributable to these accounts in first quarter 2025 was de minimis. The Company does not intend to engage in further activity with these accounts.
