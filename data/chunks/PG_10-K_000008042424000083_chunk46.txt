be tied to a different functional currency than the underlying sales), the impacts of manufacturing savings projects and reinvestments (for example, product or package improvements) and, to a lesser extent, scale impacts (for costs that are fixed or less variable in nature). The primary components of SG&A are marketing-related costs and non-manufacturing overhead costs. Marketing-related costs are primarily variable in nature, although we may achieve some level of scale benefit over time due to overall growth and other marketing efficiencies. While overhead costs are variable to some extent, we generally experience more scale-related impacts for these costs due to our ability to leverage our organization and systems' infrastructures to support business growth. The main drivers of changes in SG&A as a percentage of net sales are overhead and marketing cost savings, reinvestments (for example, increased advertising), inflation, foreign exchange fluctuations and scale impacts.

Operating Costs
Gross margin increased 350 basis points to 51.4% of net sales. The increase in gross margin was due to:
•
a 220 basis-point increase from manufacturing productivity savings,
•
160 basis points of lower commodity costs and
•
a 170 basis-point increase from higher pricing.
These increases were partially offset by:
•
an 80 basis-point decline from unfavorable product mix including the decline of the super-premium SK-II brand,
•
a 60 basis-point decline from unfavorable foreign exchange impacts,
•
30 basis points of product and packaging investments and
•
30 basis points of one-time manufacturing related costs including capacity startup costs.
Total SG&A increased 10% to $23.3 billion due to increased marketing spending and overhead costs. SG&A as a percentage of net sales increased 200 basis points to 27.7% due primarily to the increase in marketing spending as a percentage of net sales.
