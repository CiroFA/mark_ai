Summary of significant accounting policies
Business
Amgen Inc. (including its consolidated subsidiaries, referred to as “Amgen,” “the Company,” “we,” “our” or “us”) is a global biotechnology pioneer that discovers, develops, manufactures and delivers innovative human therapeutics. We operate our business in
one
operating segment: human therapeutics. See Note 2, Segment and other information.
Principles of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Amgen as well as its majority-owned subsidiaries. In determining whether we are the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity, we consider whether we have both the power to direct activities of the entity that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses of, or the right to receive benefits from, the entity that could potentially be significant to that entity. We do not have any significant interests in any variable interest entities of which we are the primary beneficiary. All material intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. Certain reclassifications have been made to prior periods in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes to conform with the current presentation.
