incidents, information and security breaches, and technology failures that have and in the future could adversely affect our ability to conduct our businesses, result in the alteration, unavailability, misuse, destruction or disclosure of information, damage our reputation, increase our regulatory and legal risks, result in additional costs or financial losses and/or otherwise adversely impact our businesses and results of operations.
Our business is highly dependent on the security, controls and efficacy of our information systems, and the information systems of our clients, third parties, the financial services industry and financial data aggregators with whom we interact, on whom we rely or who have access to our clients’ personal or account information. We rely on effective access management and the secure collection, processing, maintenance, use, transmission, storage, dissemination and disposition of information in our and our third parties’ information systems. Our cybersecurity risk and exposure remains heightened because of, among other things, our prominent size and scale, high-profile brand, geographic footprint and international presence and role in the financial services industry and the broader economy. The proliferation of third-party financial data aggregators and emerging technologies, including AI (such as
machine learning and generative AI) and robotics, increases our cybersecurity risks and exposure, including by making fraud detection and authentication more difficult.
We, our employees, customers, regulators and third parties are ongoing targets of an increasing number of cybersecurity threats and cyberattacks. The tactics, techniques and procedures used in cyberattacks are pervasive, sophisticated, evolving and designed to evade security measures, including computer viruses, malicious or destructive code (such as ransomware), social engineering (including phishing, vishing and smishing), real and virtual impersonation, denial of service or information or other security breach tactics that have and in the future are likely to result in disruptions to our businesses and operations and the loss of funds, including from attempts to defraud us and/or our customers, and impact the confidentiality, integrity or availability of our information, including intellectual property, or the personal and/or confidential information of our employees, clients and third parties. Cyberattacks are carried out on a worldwide scale and by a growing number of actors, including organized crime groups, hackers, terrorist organizations, extremist parties, hostile foreign governments and their proxies, state-sponsored actors, activists, disgruntled employees and other persons or entities, including for corporate espionage.
Cybersecurity threats and the tactics, techniques and procedures used in cyberattacks change, develop and evolve rapidly and continuously, including from growth in third-party services that facilitate or carry out cyberattacks and
