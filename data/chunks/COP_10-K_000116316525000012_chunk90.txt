binding regulations, introducing potential uncertainty into the regulatory process.

Climate Superfund laws. In 2024, New York and Vermont passed legislation seeking to hold certain energy companies financially responsible for state climate change mitigation and adaptation measures, following the “polluter pays” model of existing Superfund laws. This responsibility may include paying into a fund for infrastructure repairs and recovery from extreme weather events that would otherwise be covered by the government. While only two U.S. states have enacted such laws to date, it is likely that more states will consider a similar approach. Compliance with such legislation may expose us to significant additional liabilities.
•
Climate Private Action laws. In 2025, California, New Hampshire, and Oregon introduced bills seeking to create a private right of action for individuals to bring strict liability claims for alleged damages related to climate change impacts (including non-economic, actual and punitive damages). These bills also authorize insurance companies to pursue subrogation claims to recover damages for amounts paid to insureds for climate change impacts.
Non-regulatory initiatives or agreements.
•
The U.S. government announced on September 17, 2021 the Global Methane Pledge, a global initiative to reduce global methane emissions by at least 30 percent from 2020 levels by 2030.
•
The agreement reached in Paris in December 2015 at the 21st Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change set out a process for achieving global emissions reductions. Accordingly, parties to the Paris Agreement have set targets to reduce emissions by 2030. While the current administration has officially withdrawn the U.S. from the Paris Agreement, some states have indicated that they plan to remain committed to the goals of the agreement.
Regulated sustainability disclosures.
Governments and financial regulators are developing new reporting rules requiring increased disclosure around a range of sustainability topics. The patchwork of reporting standards that is developing may require significant increases in disclosures, which may be costly to implement. In March 2022 the U.S. SEC proposed rule changes that would require registrants to include certain climate-related disclosures in their registration statements and periodic reports; In January 2023 the EU finalized the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive that will require more detailed sustainability reporting; in June 2023 the International Sustainability Standards Board issued inaugural sustainability reporting standards; in October 2023 in California multiple bills were signed into law requiring climate-related disclosures for companies that conduct business in the state; and in September 2024, the Australian Government passed legislation which mandated a new standard for climate-related disclosures.
