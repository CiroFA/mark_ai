expend cash. The functional currency for many of our international operations is the local currency, and for other international operations,
the functional currency is the U.S.

ollar. When the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar, asset and liability accounts are translated at
period-end exchange rates, and the Company translates functional currency income and expense amounts to their U.S. dollar equivalents
using average exchange rates for the period. The U.S. dollar effects that arise from changing translation rates from functional currencies
are recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) â€“ net attributable to GE Vernova (AOCI) in the Consolidated and
