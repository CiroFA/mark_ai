of patent infringement litigation and other claims seeking damages and injunctive relief, and the resolution of these matters in aggregate may negatively impact the profitability of certain of our businesses.
Regulations applicable to our businesses impact the profitability of our businesses.
Each of our businesses, including our broadcast networks and television stations, is subject to a variety of U.S. and international regulations, which impact the operations and profitability of our businesses. Some of these regulations include:
•
U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regulation of our television and radio networks, our national programming networks and our owned television stations. See our 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K under Item 1 — Federal Communications Commission Regulation.
•
Federal, state and foreign privacy and data protection laws and regulations, including with respect to child safety. See our 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K under Item 1 — Privacy and Data Protection Regulation.

U.S. and international anti-corruption laws, sanction programs, trade restrictions, tariffs, anti-money laundering laws or currency controls.
•
Restrictions on the manner in which content is currently licensed and distributed, ownership restrictions or film or television content requirements, investment obligations or quotas. See our 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K under Item 1 — International Content Regulation.
