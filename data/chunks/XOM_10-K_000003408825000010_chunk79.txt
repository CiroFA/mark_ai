CASH CAPITAL EXPENDITURES
(Non-GAAP)
The Corporation has transitioned to providing forward investment guidance on a cash capital expenditures (Cash Capex) basis instead of the historical capital and exploration expense (Capex) basis. This approach is a useful measure for investors to understand the cash impact of investments in the business and is more aligned with standard industry practice.
Cash Capex is the sum of Additions to property, plant and equipment; Additional investments and advances; and Other investing activities including collection of advances; reduced by Inflows from noncontrolling interests for major projects, each from the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.
The components of Cash Capex and a reconciliation to the previous Capex metric are presented in the following table:
Cash Capex in 2024 was $25.6 billion. The Corporation plans to invest in the range of $27 billion to $29 billion in 2025. Included in the 2025 capital spend range is $8.1 billion of firm capital commitments. An additional $10.0 billion of firm capital commitments have been made for years 2026 and beyond. Actual spending could vary depending on the progress of individual projects and property acquisitions.
