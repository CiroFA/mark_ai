expenses increased $2.5 billion in 2023 versus 2022, reflecting the impact of the TransRe Group acquisition. The expense ratio increased 6.0 percentage points compared to 2022.

Life/health
A summary of our life/health reinsurance underwriting results follows (dollars in millions).
Premiums earned in 2024 declined $74 million compared to 2023, which included a reduction of $161 million attributable to the commutations of several U.S. life contracts in the first quarter of 2023. Otherwise, premiums earned declined $235 million (4.5%) in 2024 compared to 2023, primarily attributable to reductions in non-U.S. life business, and were substantially unchanged in 2023 versus 2022.
Pre-tax underwriting earnings decreased $131 million in 2024 compared to 2023, which increased $245 million over 2022. Earnings included gains from life contract commutations of $53 million in 2024 and $134 million in 2023. Otherwise, underwriting earnings in 2024 decreased $50 million compared to 2023, reflecting decreased earnings from non-U.S. life business and increased losses from the U.S. long-term care business in run-off, partly offset by increased earnings from U.S. life business.
Retroactive reinsurance
Pre-tax underwriting results from retroactive reinsurance derive from changes in the ultimate claim liability estimates and changes in the related deferred charge assets, as well as from foreign currency exchange gains and losses attributable to non-U.S. Dollar denominated contracts. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates produced pre-tax gains of $52 million in 2024, losses of $57 million in 2023 and gains of $168 million in 2022. Pre-tax underwriting losses before foreign currency exchange gains and losses were $898 million in 2024, $1.5 billion in 2023 and $836 million in 2022.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis
Insurance—Underwriting
Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group
Estimated ultimate claim liabilities for prior years’ contracts increased $196 million in 2024, $1.1 billion in 2023 and $86 million in 2022. The increase in 2023 was derived from higher estimates for asbestos, environmental and other casualty claims, which net of changes in deferred charges, produced a pre-tax loss of $650 million in 2023. The net effects of the increases in ultimate claim liabilities in 2024 and 2022 were relatively insignificant.
Unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses for retroactive reinsurance contracts declined $2.2 billion in 2024 to $32.4 billion on December 31, 2024, primarily due to loss payments. Deferred charge assets on retroactive reinsurance contracts declined $698 million in 2024 to $8.8 billion at December 31, 2024. Deferred charge balances will be charged to earnings over the expected remaining claims settlement periods.
