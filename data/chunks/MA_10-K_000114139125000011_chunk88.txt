entity are converted to the functional currency at the exchange rate on the transaction date.  Monetary assets and liabilities in a currency other than the functional currency are remeasured using current exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date.  Non-monetary assets and liabilities are recorded at historical exchange rates.  Resulting exchange gains and losses related to remeasurement are included in general and administrative expenses on the consolidated statements of operations.
Where a non-U.S. currency is the functional currency, translation from that functional currency to U.S. dollars is performed for balance sheet accounts using current exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and for revenue and expense accounts using a weighted-average exchange rate for the period.  Resulting translation adjustments are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).
Treasury stock
- The Company records the repurchase of shares of its common stock at cost on the trade date of the transaction.  These shares are considered treasury stock, which is a reduction to stockholders’ equity.  Treasury stock is included in authorized and issued shares but excluded from outstanding shares.  The Company also records an excise tax of 1% on the fair market value of net repurchases of shares of its common stock within treasury stock.
Share-based payments
- The Company measures share-based compensation expense at the grant date, based on the estimated fair value of the award and uses the straight-line method of attribution, net of estimated forfeitures, for expensing awards over the requisite employee service period.  The Company estimates the fair value of its non-qualified stock option awards (“Options”) using a Black-Scholes valuation model.  The fair value of restricted stock units (“RSUs”) is determined and fixed on the grant date based on the Company’s stock price, adjusted for the exclusion of dividend equivalents.  The Monte Carlo simulation valuation model is used to determine the grant date fair value of performance stock units (“PSUs”) granted.  All share-based compensation expenses are recorded in general and administrative expenses on the consolidated statements of operations.
Redeemable non-controlling interests
- The Company’s business combinations may include provisions allowing non-controlling equity owners the ability to require the Company to purchase additional interests in the subsidiary at their discretion.  The interests are initially recorded at fair value and in subsequent reporting periods are accreted or adjusted to the estimated redemption value.  The adjustments to the redemption value are recorded to retained earnings or additional paid-in capital on the consolidated balance sheets.  The redeemable non-controlling interests are considered temporary and reported outside of permanent equity on the consolidated balance sheets at the greater of the carrying amount adjusted for the non-controlling
