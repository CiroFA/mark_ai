Results of Operations
The following table provides a summary of changes in consolidated sales:
2024
Compared With
2023
Sales
Linde sales were flat for the 2024
year versus 2023.  Sales grew 2%  from higher price attainment. Volumes were flat, as new project start-ups were largely offset by base volume declines.  Cost pass-through, representing the contractual billing of energy cost variances primarily to onsite customers decreased sales by 1%, with minimal impact on operating profit. Currency translation decreased sales by 1%, primarily due to the weakening of the Brazilian real, Chinese yuan, and Mexican peso against the U.S. dollar.
Cost of sales, exclusive of depreciation and amortization
Cost of sales, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, decreased $349 million, or 2%, for the year primarily due to lower cost pass-through and productivity gains, which more than offset cost inflation. Cost of sales, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, was 51.9% and 53.2% of sales, in 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease as a percentage of sales was primarily due to higher pricing and lower cost pass-through.
Selling, general and administrative expenses
Selling, general and administrative expense ("SG&A") increased $42 million, or 1%, from $3,295 million in 2023 to $3,337 million in 2024 driven by higher costs. SG&A was 10.1% of sales in 2024 versus 10.0% in 2023. Currency impacts decreased SG&A by
