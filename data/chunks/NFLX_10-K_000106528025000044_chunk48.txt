As of December 31, 2024, we had gross unrecognized tax benefits of $432 million, of which $302 million was classified in “Other non-current liabilities" in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.  At this time, an estimate of the range of reasonably possible adjustments to the balance of unrecognized tax benefits cannot be made.  In addition, we may be required to pay deposits of approximately $800 million related to certain direct and indirect taxes in the next twelve months, which are in excess of our typical annual obligations.
Cash Flows
The following table summarizes our cash flows:
Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2024 increased $87 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023, primarily driven by a $3,304 million or 61% increase in net income, an increase in adjustments for non-cash expenses, and favorable changes in working capital, partially offset by an increase in payments for content assets.  The payments for content assets increased $3,862 million, from $13,140 million to $17,003 million, or 29%.
Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2024 decreased $2,724 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023, primarily due to there being no maturities of investments in the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to maturities of investments of $1,395 million in the year ended December 31, 2023, coupled with an increase in purchases of investments of $1,237 million and an increase in purchases of property and equipment of $91 million.
Net cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2024 decreased $1,876 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023, primarily due to proceeds from the issuance of debt of $1,794 million in the year ended December 31, 2024 and a $663 million increase in the proceeds from the issuance of common stock. These cash inflows were partially offset by the repayment upon maturity of the $400 million aggregate principal amount of our 5.750% Senior Notes in the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to no repayments of debt in the corresponding period in 2023, coupled with a $218 million increase in the repurchases of common stock.
