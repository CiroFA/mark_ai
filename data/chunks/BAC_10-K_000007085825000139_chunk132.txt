events or other technology incidents that result in outages or unavailability of information systems, part or all of the internet, cloud services and/or the financial services industry infrastructure (including funds transfers, electronic trading and algorithmic platforms and critical banking activities), which could be exacerbated by the concentration of third-party service providers or third-party
models, including AI, and result in systemic operational impact across the financial services industry or beyond. Our ability to implement backup systems and other safeguards with respect to third-party systems and the financial services industry infrastructure is more limited than with respect to our systems. Weakness in and/or the inability to simplify and improve our and our third parties’ processes or controls could impact our ability to deliver products or services to our clients and expose us to regulatory, reputational and operational risks.
There can be no assurance that our resiliency, business continuity, technology change and information security response plans will effectively mitigate our operational risks. Any backup systems or manual processes may not process data accurately and/or as quickly or effectively as our primary systems, and some data might not be available or backed up. Also, the speed in which we are able to remediate any failure or disruption of our operations and/or information systems may vary across jurisdictions. We regularly update the operational processes and information systems we rely on to support our operations and growth, including as part of our efforts to comply with all applicable LRRs globally. This updating entails significant costs and creates risks associated with implementing new or modified operational processes and information systems and integrating them with existing information systems, including business interruptions, failures or ineffectiveness.
Increasing reliance on our information systems and frequency of natural disasters heighten our risk of operational loss. Any failure or disruption of our or our third parties’ operations or information systems resulting in disruption to our critical business operations and client services, a failure to identify or effectively respond to operational risks timely and/or a failure to continue to deliver our services through an operational failure or disruption could impact the confidentiality, integrity or availability of data and information, and expose us to various risks, including market abuse, fraud, financial losses and other costs, misappropriation and corruption, loss of trust or confidence in us and/or the financial services industry, client attrition, regulatory (e.g., LRR compliance), market, privacy and liquidity risk, adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition and cause legal, regulatory or reputational harm.
