disruptions, supplier quality and sourcing issues or price increases have increased, and may continue to increase, our operating costs and can adversely impact the competitive positions of our products.
Our reliance on third-party suppliers, partners, contract manufacturers and service providers and on commodity markets to secure raw materials, parts, components and sub-systems used in our products exposes us to volatility in the prices and availability of these materials, parts, components, systems and services. As our supply chains are complex and extend into many different countries and regions around the world, we are also subject to global economic and geopolitical dynamics and risks associated with exporting components manufactured in particular countries for incorporation into finished products completed in other countries. We operate in a supply-constrained environment and are facing, and may continue to face, supply-chain shortages, inflationary pressures, shortages of skilled labor, transportation and logistics challenges and manufacturing disruptions that impact our revenue, profitability and timeliness in fulfilling customer orders. We anticipate supply chain pressures across our business will continue to challenge and adversely affect our operations and financial performance for some period of time. For example, successfully executing the significant production and delivery ramp efforts in connection with the growth of newer engine platforms such as the LEAP depends in part on our suppliers having access to the materials, skilled labor and production capacity they require and making timely deliveries to us, as well as meeting the required safety, quality and performance standards for commercial and military aviation. In addition, some of our suppliers or their sub-suppliers are limited- or sole-source suppliers, and our ability to meet our obligations to customers depends on the performance, product quality, continued product availability and stability of such suppliers. We also have dependencies on certain key internal manufacturing or other facilities. Disruptions in deliveries, capacity constraints, production disruptions up- or down-stream, price increases, or decreased availability of raw materials or commodities, including as a result of war, natural disasters (including the effects of climate change such as sea level rise, drought, flooding, wildfires and more intense weather events), actual or threatened public health pandemics or emergencies, governmental, legislative or regulatory actions, or other business continuity events, adversely affect our operations and, depending on the length and severity of the disruption, can limit our ability to meet our commitments to customers or significantly impact our operating profit or cash flows. Further, a prolonged disruption at a significant supplier or discontinuation of an important material, part, component or system can require us to identify and qualify a new supplier or develop
