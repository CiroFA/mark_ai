balance sheet date based on the closing share price at the end of the period. Equity and other investments in private companies without readily determinable fair values are carried at cost less impairments, with subsequent adjustments for observable changes (referred to as the measurement alternative). We also hold investments in convertible notes of private companies which are classified as available-for-sale debt securities, which we have elected to account for under the fair value option. The results from these equity and debt investments may fluctuate from period to period and may cause volatility to our earnings as well as impact comparability of our results from period to period.

Subscription Solutions
Subscription solutions revenues increased for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. The year-over-year increase was primarily a result of growth in MRR, which was driven largely by a higher number of merchants using our platform and by an increase in subscription plan pricing for certain plans in the second quarter of 2023.
