A reconciliation of the weighted average number of common and common equivalent shares outstanding and the number of Awards excluded from the diluted earnings per share calculation, as they were anti-dilutive, are as follows:

The following table presents our revenues by segment and primary geographical markets:
Revenues recognized in the current and prior year from performance obligations satisfied (or partially satisfied) in previous reporting periods primarily relate to revenues earned on TV/VOD licenses for titles made available to the licensee in previous reporting periods. For fiscal 2024,
$
1.0
billion
was recognized related to performance obligations satisfied prior to September 30, 2023. For fiscal 2023, $
0.9
billion was recognized related to performance obligations satisfied prior to October 1, 2022. For fiscal 2022, $
1.1
billion was recognized related to performance obligations satisfied prior to October 2, 2021.
As of September 28, 2024, revenue for unsatisfied performance obligations expected to be recognized in the future is
$
16
billion
, primarily for IP or advertising time to be made available in the future under existing agreements with merchandise and co-branding licensees and sponsors, television station affiliates, DTC wholesalers, sports sublicensees and advertisers. Of this amount, we expect to recognize approximately
$

billion
in fiscal 2025,
$
4
billion
in fiscal 2026,
$
2
billion
in fiscal 2027 and

thereafter. These amounts include only fixed consideration or minimum guarantees and do not include amounts related to (i) contracts with an original expected term of one year or less (such as most advertising contracts) or (ii) licenses of IP that are solely based on the sales of the licensee.
When the timing of the Company’s revenue recognition is different from the timing of customer payments, the Company recognizes either a contract asset (customer payment is subsequent to revenue recognition and subject to the Company satisfying additional performance obligations) or deferred revenue (customer payment precedes the Company satisfying the performance obligations). Consideration due under contracts with payment in arrears is recognized as accounts receivable. Deferred revenues are recognized as (or when) the Company performs under the contract. The Company’s contract assets and activity for the current and prior-year periods were not material.
Accounts receivable and deferred revenues from contracts with customers are as follows:
