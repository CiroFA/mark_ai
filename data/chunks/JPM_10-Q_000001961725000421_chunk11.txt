The Firm prepares its Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP and this presentation is referred to as “reported” basis; these financial statements appear on pages 78–82.
In addition to analyzing the Firm’s results on a reported basis, the Firm also reviews and uses certain non-GAAP financial measures at the Firmwide and segment level. These non-GAAP measures include:
•
Firmwide “managed” basis results, including the overhead ratio, which include certain reclassifications to present total net revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities on a basis comparable to taxable investments and securities (“FTE” basis). The corresponding income tax impact related to tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax
expense. These adjustments have no impact on net income as reported by the Firm as a whole or by the LOBs;
•
Pre-provision profit, which represents total net revenue less total noninterest expense;
•
Net interest income, net yield, and noninterest revenue excluding Markets;
•
TCE, ROTCE, and TBVPS; and
•
Adjusted expense, which represents noninterest expense excluding Firmwide legal expense.
