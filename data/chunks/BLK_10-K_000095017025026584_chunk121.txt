Account Assets and Liabilities and Separate Account Collateral Held under Securities Lending Agreements
Separate account assets are maintained by BlackRock Life Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company that is a registered life insurance company in the UK, and represent segregated assets held for purposes of funding individual and group pension contracts. The Company records equal and offsetting separate account liabilities. The separate account assets are not available to creditors of the Company and the holders of the pension contracts have no recourse to the Company’s assets. The net investment income attributable to separate account assets accrues directly to the contract owners and is not reported on the consolidated statements of income. While BlackRock has no economic interest in these assets or liabilities, BlackRock earns an investment advisory fee for the service of managing these assets on behalf of its clients.
In addition, the Company records on its consolidated statements of financial condition the separate account collateral obtained under BlackRock Life Limited securities lending arrangements for which it has legal title as its own asset in addition to an equal and offsetting separate account collateral liability for the obligation to return the collateral. The collateral is not available to creditors of the Company, and the borrowers under the securities lending arrangements have no recourse to the Company’s assets.
