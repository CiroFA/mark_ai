transaction as the basis for fair value. At least annually, these private equity investments are priced by an external source.
Our Level 3 other risk investments include securities accounted for under the equity method of accounting and, therefore, are not subject to fair value reporting. Since these securities represent less than 0.1% of our total portfolio, we include them in our Level 3 disclosures and report the activity from these investments as “other” changes in the summary of changes in fair value table and
categorize these securities as “pricing exemption securities” in the quantitative information table.
During the first three months of 2025 and for the full year of 2024, there were no material assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis.
Due to the relative size of the Level 3 securities’ fair values, compared to the total portfolio’s fair value, any changes in pricing methodology would not have a significant change in valuation that would materially impact net or comprehensive income.
The following tables provide a summary of changes in fair value associated with Level 3 assets for the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024:

For fixed maturities, these amounts are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) on our consolidated balance sheets. For equity securities, these amounts are included in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income.

INCOME TAXES
The effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, was
20.7
%
.
Deferred income taxes reflect the tax effects of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities. Although realization of the deferred tax assets is not assured, management believes that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized based on our expectation that we will be able to fully utilize the deductions that are ultimately recognized for tax purposes and, therefore,
no
valuation allowance was needed at March 31, 2025 and 2024, and December 31, 2024.
