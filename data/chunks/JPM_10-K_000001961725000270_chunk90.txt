disclosure requirements. The Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (“CSRD”) will replace and significantly expand the scope and content of certain EU ESG reporting requirements, with phased-in requirements expected to start with fiscal year 2024. The implementation of CSRD into local law has been delayed in a number of member states, including in Germany, and the Firm continues to monitor developments and potential impacts. In addition, in July 2024, the EU enacted the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (“CSDDD”), which provides for phased-in requirements starting in 2027. The CSDDD sets mandatory due diligence obligations for companies to address actual and potential human rights violations and environmental adverse impacts stemming from their own operations and business relationships, including the activities of certain companies with which they have established business relationships and also requires the adoption of company-specific climate-related transition plans. Both the CSRD and CSDDD will impact certain of the Firm’s EU and non-EU entities.
