management business. The violation of these obligations and standards by any of our employees would adversely affect our clients and us. Our business often requires that we deal with confidential matters of great significance to companies in which we may invest. If our employees were to improperly use or disclose confidential information, we could suffer serious harm to our reputation, financial position and current and future business relationships. Detecting or deterring employee misconduct is not always possible, and the extensive precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in all cases.
We are subject to U.S. and foreign
anti-corruption
and
anti-bribery
laws, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, as amended (“FCPA”), as well as
anti-money
laundering laws. Any determination that we have violated the FCPA, the EU and U.K.
anti-money
laundering regimes, the U.K.
anti-bribery
laws or other applicable
anti-corruption,
anti-bribery,
or
anti-money
laundering laws could subject us to, among other things, civil and criminal penalties or material fines, profit disgorgement, injunctions on future conduct, securities litigation and a general loss of investor confidence. Any one of these could adversely affect our business prospects, financial position or the price of our common stock. Although the current U.S. President administration has signed an executive order to pause, subject to certain exceptions, the initiation of new investigations and enforcement actions under the FCPA, such laws have attracted significant regulatory focus in recent years, including outside of the U.S. For example, the SEC will be responsible for examining investment advisers’ compliance with a U.S. Department of Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (“FinCEN”) rule currently scheduled to go into effect January 2026, that requires registered investment adviser and exempt reporting advisers to, among other measures, adopt an
anti-money
laundering and countering the financing of terrorism (“AML/CFT”) program, file certain reports with FinCEN and to maintain records related to such activities. The application of these rules would impose significant compliance costs on us. The EU and the U.K. are similarly revising their respective
anti-money
laundering regimes. The EU’s revised
anti-money
laundering regime is expected to come into effect as early as June 2026 and the U.K. has also significantly expanded the reach of its
anti-bribery
laws. While we have policies and procedures designed to ensure strict compliance by us and our personnel with the FCPA and
anti-money
laundering and other applicable laws, such policies and procedures may not be effective in all instances to prevent violations. In addition, in light of the executive order to pause initiation of new FCPA investigations and enforcement actions in the U.S., other asset managers, particularly those who, unlike us, are not subject to the anti-corruption laws of a
