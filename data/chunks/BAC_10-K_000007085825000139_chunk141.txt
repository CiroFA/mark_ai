aspects of such programs from other regulators. If we fail to meet the requirements of the regulatory settlements, orders or agreements to which we are subject, or, more generally, fail to maintain risk and control procedures and processes that meet the heightened standards established by our regulators and other government authorities, we could be required to enter into further settlements, orders or agreements and pay additional fines, penalties or judgments, or accept material regulatory restrictions on our businesses.
Improper actions, behaviors or practices by us, our employees or representatives that are illegal, unethical or contrary to our core values, including the handling of fiduciary obligations, conflicts of interest and the misuse of confidential

The complexity of the regulatory and enforcement regimes in the U.S., coupled with the global scope of our operations and the regulatory environment worldwide, also means that a single event or practice or a series of related events or practices may give rise to a significant number of overlapping investigations and regulatory proceedings, either by multiple federal and state agencies in the U.S. or by multiple regulators and other governmental entities in different jurisdictions.

Future legislative or regulatory actions, and any required changes to our business or operations or strategy, or those of third parties upon whom we rely, resulting from such developments and actions could result in a significant loss of revenue, impose additional compliance and other costs or otherwise reduce our profitability, limit the products and services that we offer or our ability to pursue certain businesses and business opportunities, require us to dispose of certain businesses or assets, affect the value of assets held, require changes in training, testing, governance, controls and procedures and compensation practices, require us to increase prices and therefore reduce demand for our products, or otherwise adversely affect our businesses.
We are subject to significant financial and reputational risks from potential liability arising from lawsuits and regulatory and government action.
We face significant legal risks in our business, with a high volume of
