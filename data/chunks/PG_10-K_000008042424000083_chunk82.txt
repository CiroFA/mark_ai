Obligation and Funded Status
.
The following provides a reconciliation of benefit obligations, plan assets and funded status of these defined benefit plans:
(1)
Primarily non-U.S.-based defined benefit retirement plans.
(2)
Primarily U.S.-based other postretirement benefit plans.
(3)
For the pension benefit plans, the benefit obligation is the projected benefit obligation. For other retiree benefit plans, the benefit obligation is the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation.
(4)
Represents the net impact of ESOP debt service requirements, which is netted against plan assets for other retiree benefits.
The actuarial gain for pension benefits in 2024 was primarily related to updating of various assumptions in the plan, offset by updates in work experience and decreases in discount rates. The actuarial gain for other retiree benefits in 2024 was primarily related to updating various assumptions in the plan based work experience and an increase in discount rates. The actuarial gain for pension plans in 2023 was primarily related to increases in discount rates, offset by inflation-related pension benefit increases. The actuarial gain for other retiree benefits in 2023 was primarily related to increases in discount rates and a decrease in assumptions for medical claims costs.
The underfunding of pension benefits is primarily a function of the different funding incentives that exist outside of the U.S. In certain countries, there are no legal requirements or financial incentives provided to companies to pre-fund pension obligations prior to their due date.
In these instances, benefit payments are typically paid directly from the Company's cash as they become due.
