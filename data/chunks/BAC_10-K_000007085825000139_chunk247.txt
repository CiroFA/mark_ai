nonaccrual status and, therefore, are not reported as nonperforming. Junior-lien home equity loans are placed on nonaccrual status and classified as nonperforming when the underlying first-lien mortgage loan becomes
90
days past due even if the junior-lien loan is current. The outstanding balance of real estate-secured loans that is in excess of the estimated property value less costs to sell is charged off no later than the end of the month in which the loan becomes
180
days past due unless the loan is fully insured, or for loans in bankruptcy, within
60
days of receipt of notification of filing, with the remaining balance classified as nonperforming.
Credit card and other unsecured consumer loans are charged off when the loan becomes
180
days past due, within
60
days after receipt of notification of death or bankruptcy or upon confirmation of fraud. These loans continue to accrue interest until they are charged off and, therefore, are not reported as nonperforming loans. Consumer vehicle loans are placed on nonaccrual status when they become
90
days past due, within
60
days after receipt of notification of bankruptcy or death or upon confirmation of fraud, unless the borrower’s performance indicates that repayment is likely to occur. These loans are charged off to the estimated fair value of the collateral less expected disposal costs when the loans become
120
days past due, upon repossession of the collateral, within
60
days after receipt of notification of bankruptcy or death or upon confirmation of fraud, and when the borrower’s ability to pay cannot be validated. If repossession of the collateral is not expected, the loans are fully charged off.
Commercial loans and leases, excluding business card loans, that are past due
90
days or more as to principal or interest, or where reasonable doubt exists as to timely collection, including loans that are individually identified as being impaired, are generally placed on nonaccrual status and classified as nonperforming unless well-secured and in the process of collection.
Business card loans are charged off in the same manner as consumer credit card loans. Other commercial loans and leases are generally charged off when all or a portion of the principal amount is determined to be uncollectible.
The entire balance of a consumer loan or commercial loan or lease is contractually delinquent if the minimum payment is not received by the specified due date on the customer’s billing
statement. Interest and fees continue to accrue on past due loans and leases until the date the loan is placed on nonaccrual status, if applicable. Accrued interest receivable is reversed when loans and leases are placed on nonaccrual status. Interest collections on nonaccruing loans and leases for which the ultimate collectability of principal is uncertain are applied as principal reductions; otherwise, such collections are credited to income when received. Loans and leases may be restored to accrual status when all
