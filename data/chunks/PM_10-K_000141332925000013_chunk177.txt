before United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida, plaintiff alleges, among other things, addiction to nicotine resulting from the use of
ZYN
nicotine pouches. The complaint named PMI and Swedish Match North America LLC as defendants.  He alleges, among other things, that defendants defectively designed

products and sold them in an unreasonably unsafe and dangerous condition, marketed

Plaintiff asserts strict liability design defect and failure to warn claims, as well as negligence and fraud claims, and is seeking compensatory and punitive damages, attorney’s fees and costs, interest, and medical monitoring.  On September 19, 2024, the court granted the parties’ joint motion to apply its decisions on the motions to dismiss in Palmer to the Lendinara matter, including granting plaintiff’s request to conduct jurisdictional discovery and setting the same timeline for plaintiff to amend his complaint. On December 4, 2024, plaintiff filed an amended complaint against PMI and Swedish Match North America LLC and added
three
additional entities as named defendants: Swedish Match USA Inc., PMI Global Services Inc., and Philip Morris Global Brands Inc. On December 18, 2024, PMI, Swedish Match USA Inc., PMI Global Services Inc., and Philip Morris Global Brands Inc., filed motions to dismiss the amended complaint with prejudice, and Swedish Match North America LLC filed a motion to dismiss the fraud claim. At this time, no estimated loss has been accrued in the consolidated financial statements for this proceeding and we cannot determine the likelihood of loss, or reasonably estimate a range of loss, if any, from this proceeding.
