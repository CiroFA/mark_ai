following guarantee arrangements:
Credit
support

699
million
of credit support on behalf of certain customers or associated companies, predominantly
joint ventures and partnerships, using arrangements such as standby letters of credit and performance guarantees, and a line of credit to
support our consolidated subsidiaries. The liability for such credit support was

for further information.
Indemnification agreements
.
We have
$
882
million
of indemnification commitments, including obligations arising from the Spin-Off, our
commercial contracts, and agreements governing the sale of business assets, for which we recorded a liability of
$
514
million
. The liability
is primarily associated with cash deposits, of which
$
325
million
relates to cash transferred to the Company from GE as part of the Spin-Off
that is restricted in connection with certain legal matters related to legacy GE operations. The liability reflects the use of these funds to
settle any associated obligations and the return of any remaining cash to GE in a future reporting period once resolved. In addition, the
liability includes
$
140
million
of indemnifications in connection with agreements entered into with GE related to the Spin-Off, including the
Tax Matters Agreement.
Product Warranties.
We provide for estimated product warranty expenses when we sell the related products. Because warranty estimates
are forecasts that are based on the best available information, mostly historical claims experience, claims costs may differ from amounts
provided.
An analysis of changes in the liability for product warranties follows.
(a)
The increase in current- and prior-year provisions is primarily related to our Wind segment, which, in 2022, was substantially all due to
changes in estimates on pre-existing warranties and related to the deployment of repairs and other corrective measures in
Onshore
Wind
