Any of the foregoing consequences could materially and adversely affect JPMorganChase’s businesses and results of operations.
JPMorganChase’s business and operations rely on its ability, and the ability of key external parties, to maintain appropriately-staffed workforces, and on the competence, trustworthiness, health and safety of employees.
JPMorganChase’s ability to operate its businesses efficiently and profitably, to offer products and services that meet the expectations of its clients and customers, and to maintain an effective risk management framework is highly dependent on its ability to staff its operations appropriately and on the competence, trustworthiness, health and safety of its employees. JPMorganChase's businesses and operations similarly rely on the workforces of third parties, including employees of vendors, custodians and financial markets infrastructures, and of businesses that it may seek to acquire. JPMorganChase’s businesses could be materially and adversely affected by:
•
the ineffective implementation of business decisions
•
any failure to institute controls that appropriately address risks associated with business activities, or to appropriately train employees with respect to those risks and controls
•
staffing shortages, particularly in tight labor markets
•
the possibility that significant portions of JPMorganChase’s workforce are unable to work effectively, including because of illness, quarantines, shelter-in-place arrangements, government actions or other restrictions in connection with health
emergencies, the spread of infectious diseases, epidemics or pandemics, or due to extraordinary events beyond JPMorganChase’s control such as natural disasters or an outbreak or escalation of hostilities
•
a significant operational breakdown or failure, theft, fraud or other unlawful conduct, or
•
other negative outcomes caused by human error or misconduct by an employee of JPMorganChase or of another party on which JPMorganChase’s businesses or operations rely.
JPMorganChase’s operations could also be impaired if the measures taken by it or by governmental authorities to protect the health and safety of its employees are ineffective, or if any external party on which JPMorganChase relies fails to take appropriate and effective actions to protect the health and safety of its employees.
JPMorganChase faces substantial legal and operational risks in the processing and safeguarding of personal information.
JPMorganChase’s businesses and operations are subject to complex and evolving laws, rules and regulations, both within and outside the U.S., governing the privacy and protection of personal information of individuals. Governmental authorities around
