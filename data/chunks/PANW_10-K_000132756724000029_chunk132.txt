Assumed Share-Based Compensation Plans

The equity awards assumed in connection with each acquisition were granted from their respective assumed plans. The assumed equity awards will be settled in shares of our common stock and will retain the terms and conditions under which they were originally granted. No additional equity awards will be granted under and forfeited awards will not be returned to the Assumed Plans. Refer to Note 7. Acquisitions for more information on our acquisitions and the related equity awards assumed.
