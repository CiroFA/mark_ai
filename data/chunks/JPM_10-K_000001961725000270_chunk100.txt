regulations and implementing and administering related internal policies and procedures.
There can be no assurance that JPMorganChase will always be successful in its efforts to fully understand and to conduct its business in compliance with the laws, rules and regulations of all of the jurisdictions in which it operates, and the risk of non-compliance, or of interference with JPMorganChase's businesses, can be greater in jurisdictions that have less predictable legal and regulatory frameworks.
JPMorganChase's businesses may be negatively impacted by governmental policies that either discourage or penalize business with certain industries or require specific business practices.
JPMorganChase's businesses and results of operations may be adversely affected by actions or initiatives by national, state or local governmental authorities that:
•
seek to discourage financial institutions from doing business with companies engaged in certain industries, or conversely, to penalize financial institutions that elect not to do business with such companies, or
•
mandate specific business practices that companies operating in the relevant jurisdiction must adopt.
Because governmental policies in one jurisdiction may differ or conflict with those in other jurisdictions, JPMorganChase may face negative consequences regardless of the course of action it takes or elects not to take, including:
•
restrictions or prohibitions on doing business within a particular jurisdiction, or with governmental entities in a jurisdiction
•
the threat of enforcement actions, including under antitrust or other anti-competition laws, rules and regulations, and
•
harm to its reputation arising from public criticism, including from politicians, activists and other stakeholders.
JPMorganChase has been prohibited from engaging in certain business activities in specific jurisdictions as a result of these types of governmental actions, and there is no assurance that it will not face similar restrictions on its business and operations in the future.
Requirements for the orderly resolution of JPMorganChase could result in JPMorganChase having to restructure or reorganize its businesses and could increase its funding or operational costs or curtail its businesses.
JPMorganChase is required under Federal Reserve and FDIC rules to prepare and submit periodically to those agencies a detailed plan for rapid and orderly resolution in bankruptcy, without extraordinary government support, in the event of material financial distress or failure. The evaluation of JPMorganChase’s resolution plan by these agencies may change, and the requirements for resolution plans may be modified from time to time. Any such determinations or modifications could result in JPMorganChase needing to make changes to its legal entity structure or to certain internal or external activities, which could increase its funding or operational costs, or hamper its ability to serve clients and customers.
