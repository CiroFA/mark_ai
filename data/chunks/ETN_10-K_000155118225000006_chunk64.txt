assessment involving the recognition of income for several of Eaton US’s controlled foreign corporations. The Company believes that the proposed assessment is without merit and contested the matter in Tax Court. In October 2017, Eaton and the IRS both moved for partial summary judgment on this issue. On February 25, 2019, the Tax Court granted the IRS’s motion for partial summary judgment and denied Eaton’s. The Company intends to appeal the Tax Court’s partial summary judgment decision to the United States Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals. The total potential impact of the Tax Court's partial summary judgment decision on the controlled foreign corporation income recognition issue is not estimable until all matters in the open tax years have been resolved.
U.S. Tax Years 2011-2013
In 2018, the IRS completed its examination of Eaton US for tax years 2011 through 2013 and proposed adjustments. Those adjustments were the subject of administrative appeals, which concluded without resolution. As a result, on December 21, 2022, the IRS issued Statutory Notices of Deficiency for Eaton US for these tax years (the 2011-2013 Notice) proposing assessments of $
749
million in additional taxes plus $
110
million in penalties, net of agreed credits and deductions. The proposed assessments pertain to: (i) transfer pricing adjustments similar to those proposed in the 2007-10 Notice for products manufactured in the Company’s facilities in Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic and sold to affiliated companies located in the U.S.; (ii) adjustments involving the recognition of income for several of Eaton US’s controlled foreign corporations; (iii) transfer pricing adjustments for products manufactured in one of the Company’s facilities in Mexico and sold to affiliated companies located in the U.S.; and (iv) adjustments challenging the appropriate interest rate on intercompany debt and amount of intercompany fees charged for financial guarantees on external debt. On March 3, 2023, the Company filed its petition to the U.S. Tax Court. The Company will vigorously defend its positions through litigation, which will take several years for final resolution.
U.S. Tax Years 2014-2016
