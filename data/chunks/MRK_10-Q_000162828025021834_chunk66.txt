Analysis of Liquidity and Capital Resources
Cash provided by operating activities was $2.5 billion in the first three months of 2025 compared with $3.1 billion in the first three months of 2024. Cash provided by operating activities was reduced by milestone payments related to certain collaborations of $700 million and $245 million in the first three months of 2025 and 2024, respectively. Cash provided by operating activities continues to be the Company’s primary source of funds to finance operating needs, with excess cash serving as the primary source of funds to finance business development transactions, capital expenditures, dividends paid to shareholders and treasury stock purchases.
Cash used in investing activities was $1.5 billion in the first three months of 2025 compared with $1.4 billion in the first three months of 2024.

Cash used in financing activities was $5.8 billion in the first three months of 2025 compared with $2.8 billion in the first three months of 2024.
