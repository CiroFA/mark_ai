Net country exposure for these 20 countries increased $6.1 billion from December 31, 2024 primarily driven by increases in Germany, India and Singapore.
Our largest non-U.S. country exposure at March 31, 2025 was the United Kingdom with net exposure of $59.9 billion, which decreased $2.1 billion from December 31, 2024 primarily due to lower deposits with the central bank. Our second largest non-U.S. country exposure was Germany with net exposure of $40.0 billion at March 31, 2025, which increased $3.0 billion from December 31, 2024 primarily due to increased exposure to sovereign institutions.
