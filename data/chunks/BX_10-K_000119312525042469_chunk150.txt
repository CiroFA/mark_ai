Expenses
Expenses were $6.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2024, an increase of $1.8 billion, compared to $5.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase of $1.7 billion in Total Compensation and Benefits, of which $1.3 billion was an increase in Performance Allocations Compensation. The increase in Performance Allocations Compensation was primarily due to the increase in Investment Income, on which a portion of compensation is based.
Other Income (Loss)
Other Income (Loss) was $48.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, an increase of $132.8 million, compared to $(84.0) million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase in Other Income (Loss) was principally due to an increase of $146.9 million in Net Gains (Losses) from Fund Investment Activities.
The increase in Net Gains (Losses) from Fund Investment Activities was driven by an increase of $169.7 million in our Real Estate segment, partially offset by a decrease of $41.0 million in our Private Equity segment. The increase in our Real Estate segment was primarily driven by lower unrealized depreciation of investments and lower realized losses on investments in our consolidated funds. The decrease in our Private Equity segment was primarily due to the deconsolidation of a fund, partially offset by higher unrealized appreciation of investments in our consolidated funds.

Provision for Taxes
Blackstone’s Provision for Taxes for the year ended December 31, 2024 was $1.0 billion, an increase of $508.2 million, compared to $513.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. This resulted in an effective tax rate of 15.8% and 17.4% based on our Income Before Provision for Taxes of $6.5 billion and $3.0 billion for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
The decrease in Blackstone’s effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to the year ended December 31, 2023, relates primarily to the impact of
Non-Controlling
Interests in Consolidated Entities and a decrease in Blackstone’s state tax provisions for the jurisdictions in which it operates.
Blackstone had a corporate alternative minimum tax (“CAMT”) liability for the year ended December 31, 2024 as calculated pursuant to the Inflation Reduction Act. Blackstone will continue to assess the overall impact to its Provision for Income Tax upon the issuance of applicable additional guidance by the U.S. Treasury Department related to interpretations of CAMT. For the year ended December 31, 2024 there is no meaningful CAMT impact reflected in the Provision for Income Taxes given current year tax payments made under CAMT are permitted to be carried forward and used as credits in future years resulting in a deferred tax benefit.
