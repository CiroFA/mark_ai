facility scheduled to expire in July 2024.
In May 2024, we increased our commercial paper program from $5.0 billion to $19.5 billion in connection with the anticipated financing of the acquisition of SRS (see
Note 13
to our consolidated financial statements for details regarding the SRS acquisition). In May 2024, in connection with the increase in the commercial paper program, we entered into three additional back-up credit facilities that consisted of a 364-day $3.5 billion credit facility scheduled to expire in May 2025, a three-year $1.0 billion credit facility scheduled to expire in May 2027, and a 364-day $10.0 billion credit facility scheduled to expire in May 2025. The $10.0 billion credit facility also provided that the commitments and any borrowings under that facility would be reduced by the amount of net cash proceeds we receive from any future debt issuance.
In June 2024, leading up to the acquisition of SRS on June 18, 2024, we raised commercial paper borrowings of over $15.0 billion to fund the transaction. On June 25, 2024, we received the proceeds from the issuance of $10.0 billion of long-term debt, as further discussed below, and immediately used the proceeds to repay approximately $10.0 billion of these commercial paper borrowings. On June 27, 2024, we terminated the $10.0 billion back-up credit facility, and subsequently reduced our commercial paper program from $19.5 billion to $9.5 billion.
In July 2024, we completed the renewal of our 364-day $1.5 billion credit facility, extending the maturity from July 2024 to July 2025.
In December 2024, we reduced our total credit facilities and concurrently reduced our commercial paper program, each by $2.5 billion. This reduction included terminating the three-year $1.0 billion back-up credit facility that was scheduled to expire in May 2027 and reducing the aggregate commitments under the 364-day back-up credit facility that is scheduled to expire in May 2025 from $3.5 billion to $2.0 billion. As of February 2, 2025, our commercial paper program allowed for an aggregate of $7.0 billion in borrowings and is supported by $7.0 billion of back-up credit facilities.
All of our short-term borrowings in fiscal 2024 were under our commercial paper program, and the maximum amount outstanding at any time was $15.3 billion. At February 2, 2025, we had outstanding borrowings under our commercial paper program of $316 million with a weighted-average interest rate of 4.4%, we had no outstanding borrowings under our back-up credit facilities, and we were in compliance with all of the covenants contained in our credit facilities, none of which are expected to impact our liquidity or capital resources.

We also issue senior notes from time to time as part of our capital management strategy. As discussed above, in June 2024, we issued $10.0 billion of senior notes in connection with the funding of the acquisition of SRS. Separately, in February 2024, we repaid $1.1 billion of senior
