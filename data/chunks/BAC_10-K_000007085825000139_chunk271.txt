Credit Card and Other Consumer
Credit card and other consumer loans are primarily modified by placing the customer on a fixed payment plan with a significantly reduced fixed interest rate, with terms ranging from
6
months to
72
months, most of which had a
60-month
term at December 31, 2024. In certain circumstances, the Corporation will forgive a portion of the outstanding balance if the borrower makes payments up to a set amount. The Corporation makes modifications directly with borrowers for loans held by the Corporation (internal programs) as well as through third-party renegotiation agencies that provide solutions to customers’ entire unsecured debt structures (external programs). The December 31, 2024 amortized cost of credit card and other consumer loans that were modified through these programs during 2024 was $
650
million compared to $
598
million in 2023. These modifications represented
0.31
percent of outstanding credit card and other consumer loans for 2024 compared to
0.29
percent for 2023. During 2024, the financial effect of modifications resulted in a weighted-average interest rate reduction of
18.89
percent compared to
19.02
percent in 2023, and principal forgiveness of $
113
million compared to $
61
million in 2023.
The Corporation tracks the performance of modified loans to assess effectiveness of modification programs. During 2024 and 2023, defaults of credit card and other consumer loans that had been modified within 12 months were insignificant. At December 31, 2024, modified credit card and other consumer loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty over the last 12 months totaled $
650
million, of which $
546
million were current, $
58
million were 30-89 days past due, and $
46
million were greater than 90 days past due. At December 31, 2023, modified credit card and other consumer loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty totaled $
598
million, of which $
491
million were current, $
59
million were 30-89 days past due, and $
48
million were greater than 90 days past due.
Commercial Loans
Modifications of loans to commercial borrowers experiencing financial difficulty are designed to reduce the Corporation’s loss exposure while providing borrowers with an opportunity to work through financial difficulties, often to avoid foreclosure or bankruptcy. Each modification is unique, reflects the borrower’s individual circumstances and is designed to benefit the borrower while mitigating the Corporation’s risk exposure. Commercial modifications are primarily term extensions and payment forbearances. Payment forbearances involve the Corporation forbearing its
