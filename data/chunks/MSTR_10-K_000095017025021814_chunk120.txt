On January 24, 2025, we delivered the Notice to the trustee for full redemption of our 2027 Convertible Notes.

We have elected to settle our conversion obligation with respect to the 2027 Convertible Notes by delivering solely shares of our class A common stock, together with cash in lieu of any fractional shares.
Prior to our delivery of the Notice, we received conversion requests at the original conversion price of $143.25 per share for approximately $1.8 million in principal amount of 2027 Convertible Notes. Subsequent to our delivery of the Notice, we have received conversion requests at the Adjusted Conversion Price.
