Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated
financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.
Tobacco-Related Litigation for Smoking and Health Class Actions and Health Care Cost Recovery Cases
As desc
ribed in Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has nine smoking and health class actions and 17 health care cost recovery cases pending. The Company records provisions in the consolidated financial statements for pending litigation when management determines that an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.  Except as stated otherwise in Note 18, w

The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to tobacco-related litigation for smoking and health class actions and health care cost recovery actions is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when assessing the probability of a loss being incurred and determining whether the amount or range of the potential loss for each case can be reasonably estimated and (ii) a  high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence related to managementâ€™s assessment of the loss contingencies associated with smoking and health class actions and health care cost recovery actions.
