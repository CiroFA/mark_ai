PART I
Item 1.  Business
Our mission is to make it easier for everyone to experience the world. We aim to provide consumers with a best-in-class experience offering the travel choices they want, with tailored planning, payment, language, and other options, seamlessly connecting them with our travel service provider partners. We offer these services through five primary consumer-facing brands: Booking.com, Priceline, Agoda, KAYAK, and OpenTable:
We are proud that, despite ongoing challenges to our global community such as the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East and the impact of inflation, we continued our efforts to make our brands the most trusted and convenient platforms for consumers and partners, including:
•
achieving record annual room nights in 2024;
•
continuing to increase brand awareness in key markets such as the U.S., including through high-profile sponsorships in the U.S.;
•
growing our alternative accommodations offering;
•
improving our loyalty programs, particularly by expanding the Genius program at Booking.com into more travel verticals;
•
further integrating generative artificial intelligence ("Gen AI") technology into our offerings to add value for consumers and partners;
•
using Gen AI to drive efficiencies in our operations;
•
seeking to more effectively manage operating expenses to increase organizational agility and create more capacity for reinvestment, with plans to continue expense reduction in 2025;
•
improving and expanding our flight offering at Booking.com and Agoda, and offering more opportunities for consumers to discover and book Connected Trips; and
•
increasing adoption of our payments platform and capabilities.

Our Business Model
We derive substantially all of our revenues from providing online travel reservation services, which facilitate online travel purchases by travelers from travel service providers (which we generally refer to as "consumers" and "partners," respectively).

For the year ended December 31, 2024, we had revenues of $23.7 billion, which we classify as "merchant" revenues, "agency" revenues, and "advertising and other" revenues.
