We also operate another two exploration blocks, Block WL4-00 and Block SK304, in waters off the eastern Malaysian state of Sarawak.
Block J
Gumusut
We own a 29.5 percent working interest in the unitized Gumusut Field. Development associated with Gumusut Phase 4, a four-well program targeting the Brunei acreage of the unitized Gumusut Field that straddles Malaysia and Brunei waters, completed drilling in 2024 with first oil anticipated in early 2025. The unitized Gumusut Field is operated on a FPS with oil evacuation via a pipeline to the Sabah Oil and Gas Terminal (SOGT) for tanker liftings.
KBBC
We own a 30 percent working interest in the KBB, Kamunsu East and Kamunsu East Upthrown Canyon gas and condensate fields. KBBC was previously operated by a joint operating company, Kebabangan Petroleum Operating Company, and in January 2025, we became the sole operator of KBBC. There was no change to working interest as part of ConocoPhillips becoming sole operator.
KBB
Gas is transported from the KBB platform via pipeline for sale to the domestic gas market. Since 2019, KBB tied-in to a nearby third-party floating LNG vessel, which provided additional gas offtake capacity.
Block G
Malikai
We own a 35 percent working interest in Malikai. Malikai Phase 2 development first oil was achieved in February 2021. Malikai operates on a tension leg platform and pipes oil to the KBB platform for processing. Oil evacuation is via pipeline to SOGT for tanker liftings.
Siakap North-Petai
We own a 21 percent working interest in the unitized Siakap North-Petai (SNP) oil field. First oil from SNP Phase 2 was achieved in November 2021. The subsea system in the SNP oil field is tied back to a FPSO operated by PTTEP.
Exploration
We operate three exploration PSCs with 85 percent working interest in Block SK304, 50 percent working interest in Block WL4-00 and 35 percent working interest in the Ubah Cluster. Off the coast of Sarawak, offshore Malaysia, Block SK304 encompasses 1.8 million net acres and Block WL4-00 encompasses 0.3 million net acres. Off the coast of Sabah, offshore Malaysia near the KBBC, the Ubah Cluster encompasses 11 thousand net acres. We continue to evaluate these blocks and are using information from seismic and prior well results to help optimize future plans.
In 2021, we were awarded operatorship and an 85 percent working interest in Block SB405 encompassing 1.2 million net acres off the coast of Sabah, offshore Malaysia. A 3D seismic survey was acquired in 2022, and processing and evaluation work was completed in 2024. In the fourth quarter of 2024, we elected not to proceed to the second phase of exploration for SB405 PSC and relinquished the block.
Other International
The Other International segment includes interests in Colombia as well as contingencies associated with prior operations in other countries.
Colombia
We have an 80 percent working interest in the Middle Magdalena Basin Block VMM-3 extending over approximately 67,000 net acres. In
