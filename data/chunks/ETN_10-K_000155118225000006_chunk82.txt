Over the course of a year, cash, short-term investments, and short-term debt may fluctuate in order to manage global liquidity. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, Eaton had cash of $555 million and $488 million, short-term investments of $1,525 million and $2,121 million, respectively, with no short-term debt as of December 31, 2024 and $8 million as of December 31, 2023. Eaton has investment grade credit ratings from the two major rating agencies as reflected in the following ratings assigned to its debt:
Eaton believes it has the operating flexibility, cash flow, cash and short-term investment balances, availability under existing revolving credit facilities, and access to capital markets in excess of the liquidity necessary to meet future operating needs of the business, fund capital expenditures and acquisitions of businesses, as well as scheduled payments of long-term debt.

Eaton’s credit facilities and indentures governing certain long-term debt contain various covenants, the violation of which would limit or preclude the use of the credit facilities for future borrowings, or might accelerate the maturity of the related outstanding borrowings covered by the indentures. At Eaton’s present credit rating level, the most restrictive financial covenant provides that the ratio of secured debt (or lease payments due under a sale and leaseback transaction) to adjusted consolidated net worth (or consolidated net tangible assets, in each case as defined in the relevant credit agreement or indenture) may not exceed 10%. Eaton's actual ratios are substantially below the required threshold. In addition, Eaton was in compliance with each of its debt covenants for all periods presented.
