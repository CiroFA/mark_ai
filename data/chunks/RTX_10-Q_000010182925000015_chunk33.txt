Whitney, $0.6 billion at Collins, and $0.1 billion at Raytheon.
The decrease in net sales due to Acquisitions and divestitures, net of $0.5 billion for the quarter ended March 31, 2025 compared to the quarter ended March 31, 2024, was primarily driven by the sale of our Cybersecurity, Intelligence and Services (CIS) business within our Raytheon segment completed in the first quarter of 2024.
See “Segment Review” below for further information by segment.
Refer to “Note 18: Segment Financial Data” within Item 1 of this Form 10-Q for the composition of external net sales by products and services by segment.
Net products sales increased $0.3 billion in the quarter ended March 31, 2025 compared to the quarter ended March 31, 2024 primarily due to increases in external products sales of $0.3 billion at Collins and $0.1 billion at Pratt & Whitney, partially offset by a decrease in external products sales of $0.1 billion at Raytheon.
Net services sales increased $0.7 billion in the quarter ended March 31, 2025 compared to the quarter ended March 31, 2024 primarily due to increases in external services sales of $0.8 billion at Pratt & Whitney and $0.1 billion at Collins, partially offset by a decrease in external services sales of $0.3 billion at Raytheon, primarily driven by the sale of the CIS business completed in the first quarter of 2024.

Cost of Sales
The factors contributing to the change year-over-year in total cost of sales for the quarter ended March 31, 2025 are as follows:
(1)    See “Results of Operations” for definition of organic. A reconciliation of this measure to reported U.S. GAAP amounts is provided in the table above.
The organic increase in total cost of sales of $1.1 billion for the quarter ended March 31, 2025 compared to the quarter ended March 31, 2024, was primarily driven by the organic net sales increases at Pratt & Whitney, Collins, and Raytheon noted above.
The decrease in total cost of sales due to Acquisitions and divestitures, net of $0.4 billion for the quarter ended March 31, 2025 compared to the quarter ended March 31, 2024, was primarily driven by the sale of the CIS business within our Raytheon segment completed in the first quarter of 2024.
Other cost of sales decreased $0.2 billion in the quarter ended March 31, 2025 compared to the quarter ended March 31, 2024, primarily driven by the absence of $0.2 billion of charges recorded in the first quarter of 2024 at Collins related to the recognition of unfavorable purchase commitments and an impairment of contract fulfillment costs that were no longer recoverable as a result of initiating alternative titanium sources.
Restructuring actions relate to ongoing cost reduction efforts including workforce reductions and the consolidation of facilities.
