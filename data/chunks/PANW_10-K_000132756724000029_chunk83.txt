resiliency of our operations and the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our information systems, data, and information assets. The organizational, administrative and technical measures we implement are based on recognized security frameworks established by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, security measures aligned with the ISO/IEC 27000 series of standards, and other generally recognized industry standards. The program is assessed regularly and in light of new and emerging cybersecurity risks.
•
Technical Safeguards and Product Security.
We deploy and maintain a variety of technologies to prevent and detect cybersecurity threats across the network, endpoint and cloud. We also apply security-by-design principles in our software development lifecycle, track vulnerabilities of open-source software, and run internal and external network scans at least weekly and after any meaningful change in our network configuration. We conduct regular application security assessments, including our assessments for internet-facing applications that collect, transmit, or display end user data. We also employ tooling in certain areas to help prevent deviations from policy.
•
Incident Response and Reporting.
We maintain incident response and recovery protocols to enable prompt, effective and orderly identification, evaluation, management, and disposition of actual and potential security threats and incidents, including for purposes of escalation and internal and external-notification steps. We maintain a cross-functional incident response team, including senior representatives from information security, information technology, product, legal, privacy, communications and accounting, that is involved in assessing cybersecurity threats and incidents, assigning severity levels, and evaluating the potential impact, including the potential impact on our business strategy, results of operations and financial condition. This allows for prompt direction of appropriate personnel and resources for incident management and response, and internal notification to appropriate members of management, which may include our chief executive officer, chief product officer, chief information security officer, general counsel, chief financial officer, and/or chief accounting officer, and the security committee of our board of directors (the “Security Committee”). The protocols also establish steps designed to publicly report and/or alert external stakeholders as and when required by applicable law or otherwise determined appropriate.
•
Third-Party Risk Management.
We maintain a risk-based approach to identifying and overseeing cybersecurity risks presented by certain third parties, including vendors, service providers, suppliers, operations parties, and other external users of our systems, as well as the systems of third parties that could adversely impact our business in the event of a cybersecurity incident affecting those third-party systems.
