Employer.
As an employer of full-time, part-time, seasonal, unionized and non-unionized labor, we are required to create
compensation programs, employment policies, and other administrative programs that comply with the laws of multiple countries.
In addition, there are diverse global regulations regarding our independent and third-party contractor workforce. Our operations
are subject to global labor and employment laws, including minimum wage and living wage laws and directives, wage and hour
laws, health and safety laws such as Occupational Safety and Health Administration (
OSHA
), immigration laws, and laws relating
to minimum age child labor,
modern slavery, and forced labor. Federal and local labor laws also govern our interactions with
employee-representative organizations around the world. We also have significant obligations and liabilities with respect to our
postretirement benefit plans, including pension, healthcare, and life insurance benefits obligations, all of which are subject to
applicable laws and regulations.
These laws and regulations are subject to change at any time. We make the necessary adjustments to our processes in order to maintain
compliance with the regulatory environment impacting all aspects of our businesses. Complying with requirements can impose significant
costs, especially in jurisdictions where we do not have a significant physical presence. See Item 1A. "Risk Factors" for further information
regarding risks and costs associated with such compliance.
