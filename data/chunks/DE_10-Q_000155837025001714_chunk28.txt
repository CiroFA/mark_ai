Banco John Deere S.A.
In 2024, we entered into a joint venture agreement with a Brazilian bank, Banco Bradesco S.A. (Bradesco), for Bradesco to invest and become
50
% owner of our wholly-owned subsidiary in Brazil, Banco John Deere S.A. (BJD). BJD is included in our financial services segment and finances retail and wholesale loans for agricultural, construction, and forestry equipment. The transaction is intended to reduce our incremental risk as we continue to grow in the Brazilian market. In February 2025, Bradesco contributed capital equal to our equity investment in BJD. We retained a
50
% equity interest in BJD and will report the results of the joint venture as an equity investment in unconsolidated affiliates.
The BJD business was reclassified as held for sale in 2024. At January 26, 2025, the valuation allowance on “Assets held for sale” decreased to $
65
, resulting in a pretax and
after-tax gain
(reversal of previous losses) of $
32
recorded in “Selling, administrative and general expenses” in the three months ended January 26, 2025 and presented in “Impairments and other adjustments” in the statements of consolidated cash flows.
The major classes of the total consolidated assets and liabilities of BJD that were classified as held for sale and liabilities of BJD to other intercompany parties were as follows:
