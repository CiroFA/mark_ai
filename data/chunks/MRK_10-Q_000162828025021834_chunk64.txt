Research and Development Update
The Company currently has several candidates under regulatory review in the U.S. and internationally.
MK-1022, patritumab deruxtecan, is a potential first-in-class HER3 directed DXd antibody drug conjugate (ADC), under review by the FDA for the treatment of adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic EGFR-mutated NSCLC previously treated with two or more systemic therapies. The Biologics License Application (BLA) is based on the primary results from the HERTHENA-Lung01 pivotal Phase 2 trial and data results presented at the IASLC 2023 World Conference on Lung Cancer, which were simultaneously published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology. In June 2024, the FDA issued a complete response letter (CRL) for the BLA due to findings pertaining to an inspection of a third-party manufacturing facility. The CRL did not identify any issues with the efficacy or safety data submitted. Patritumab deruxtecan (HER3-DXd) was discovered by Daiichi Sankyo and is being jointly developed by Daiichi Sankyo and Merck. Merck is working with Daiichi Sankyo to address FDA feedback.
MK-3475A, pembrolizumab with berahyaluronidase alfa (MK-5180) for subcutaneous administration (subcutaneous pembrolizumab), is being evaluated for noninferiority with respect to pharmacokinetics to intravenous
