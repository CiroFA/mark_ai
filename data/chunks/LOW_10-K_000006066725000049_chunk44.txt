Macroeconomic factors, such as ongoing inflation and higher interest rates resulting in depressed levels of housing turnover,  continued to exert downward pressure on big-ticket DIY discretionary spending in fiscal 2024.  Despite these factors, we generated positive Pro customer comparable sales and increased Pro penetration for the year.  This is the result of our cumulative investments in the right brands and products, greater inventory depth, improved job site delivery, dedicated service levels, and the Pro customer digital experience.  In addition, our strong online performance gives us confidence that our focus on an intuitive user experience and omnichannel fulfillment capabilities, specifically more same-day delivery options and an improved Buy Online Pickup in Store experience, are resonating with our customers.
