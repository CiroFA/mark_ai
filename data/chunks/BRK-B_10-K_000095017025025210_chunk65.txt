submit new commitments every five years, with the expectation that the commitments will be more aggressive in reducing GHG emissions. In the context of the Paris Agreement, the U.S. agreed to reduce GHG emissions by 26% to 28% from 2005 levels by 2025. The Paris Agreement formally became effective on November 4, 2016; however, the U.S. completed its withdrawal from the Paris Agreement on November 4, 2020. President Biden accepted the terms of the climate agreement on January 20, 2021, and the U.S. completed its reentry on February 19, 2021. New commitments to the Paris Agreement were announced in April 2021, with the U.S. pledging to cut its overall GHG emissions by 50% to 52% from 2005 levels by 2030 and to reach 100% carbon pollution-free electricity by 2035. In December 2024, President Biden released new commitments to reach a 61% to 66% reduction in emissions by 2035 from 2005 levels, which includes a 35% reduction in methane emissions. While in January 2025, President Trump ordered to withdraw the U.S. from the Paris Agreement, the outgoing Biden administration highlighted that the revised targets could be met without federal action. Increasingly, states are adopting legislation and regulations to reduce GHG emissions, and local governments and consumers are seeking increasing amounts of clean and renewable energy.
In April 2024, the EPA finalized new rules addressing GHG emissions for the power sector. The requirements are scheduled to take effect January 1, 2030. New natural gas-fueled combustion turbines are expected to utilize lower-emitting fuels and operate as highly efficient generation. Additionally, new baseload combustion turbines exceeding a 40% annual capacity factor must meet an emission limit equivalent to operating with carbon capture and sequestration beginning January 1, 2032. The EPA also identified carbon capture and sequestration as the technology basis for the emissions standards for coal units. Coal-fueled units that will operate after December 31, 2038, must meet emission limits equivalent to operating with carbon capture and sequestration beginning January 1, 2032. Other units are anticipated to co-fire with natural gas and retire prior to January 1, 2039, or convert to natural gas operations and meet emission limits corresponding to capacity factors. The EPA deferred action on standards for existing natural gas-fueled combustion turbines. The rule has been challenged in the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. The incoming Trump administration is expected to ask the court to abate litigation while it reevaluates the rule. Because the rule is final and in effect, additional rulemaking would be required to rescind and potentially replace the emissions standards.
In November 2021, the EPA proposed rules that would reduce methane emissions from both new and existing sources in the oil and natural gas industry. The proposals would expand and strengthen emission reduction requirements for new, modified and reconstructed oil and
