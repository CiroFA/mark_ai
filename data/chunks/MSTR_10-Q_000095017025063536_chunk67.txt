financial results, and affect the carrying value of our bitcoin on our balance sheet. As described in greater detail under the risk factor heading “Risks Related to Our Business in General-Unrealized gains on our bitcoin holdings could cause us to become subject to the corporate alternative minimum tax under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022,” ASU 2023-08 could also have adverse tax consequences. These impacts could in turn have a material adverse effect on our financial results and the market price of our listed securities. Additionally, as a result of ASU 2023-08 requiring a cumulative-effect adjustment to our opening balance of retained earnings as of January 1, 2025 and not permitting retrospective restatement of our historical financial statements, our results for the quarter ended March 31, 2025, and for future periods, will not be comparable to results from periods prior to our adoption of the guidance.

Bitcoin is a highly volatile asset, and fluctuations in the price of bitcoin have in the past influenced and are likely to continue to influence our financial results and the market price of our listed securities. Our financial results and the market price of our listed securities would be adversely affected, and our business and financial condition would be negatively impacted, if the price of bitcoin decreased substantially (as it has in the past, including during 2022), including as a result of:
•
decreased user and investor confidence in bitcoin, including due to the various factors described herein;
•
investment and trading activities, such as (i) trading activities of highly active retail and institutional users, speculators, miners and investors; (ii) actual or expected significant dispositions of bitcoin by large holders, including the expected liquidation of digital assets seized by governments or associated with entities that have filed for bankruptcy protection, such as the (a) transfers of bitcoin to creditors of the hacked cryptocurrency exchange Mt. Gox which began in July 2024, (b) transfers of bitcoin to claimants following proceedings related to a 2016 hack of Bitfinex-which claims are currently being adjudicated, (c) sales of bitcoin by the German government following the seizure of about 50,000 bitcoin in January 2024 from the operator of Movie2k.to, or (d) potential sales of 69,370 bitcoin seized from the Silk Road
