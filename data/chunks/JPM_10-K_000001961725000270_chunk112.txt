Parent Company’s ability to:
•
pay interest on its debt securities
•
pay dividends on its equity securities
•
redeem or repurchase outstanding securities, and
•
fulfill its other payment obligations.
These arrangements could also result in the Parent Company seeking protection under bankruptcy laws or otherwise entering into resolution proceedings at a time earlier than would have been the case absent the existence of the capital and liquidity thresholds to which JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and the IHC are subject.
Reductions in JPMorganChase’s credit ratings may adversely affect its liquidity and cost of funding.
JPMorgan Chase & Co. and certain of its principal subsidiaries are rated by credit rating agencies. Rating agencies evaluate general, firm-specific and industry-specific factors when determining credit ratings for a particular financial institution, including:
•
expected future profitability
•
risk management practices
•
legal expenses
•
ratings differentials between bank holding companies and their bank and non-bank subsidiaries
•
regulatory developments
•
assumptions about government support, and
•
economic and geopolitical developments.
JPMorganChase closely monitors and manages, to the extent that it is able, factors that could influence its credit ratings. However, there is no assurance that JPMorganChase’s credit ratings will not be downgraded in the future. Furthermore, any such downgrade could occur at times of broader market instability when JPMorganChase’s options for responding to events may be more limited and general investor confidence is low.
A reduction in JPMorganChase’s credit ratings could curtail JPMorganChase’s business activities and reduce its profitability in a number of ways, including:
•
reducing its access to capital markets
•
materially increasing its cost of issuing and servicing securities
•
triggering additional collateral or funding requirements, and
•
decreasing the number of investors and counterparties that are willing or permitted to do business with or lend to JPMorganChase.
Any rating reduction could also increase the credit spreads charged by the market for taking credit risk on JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its subsidiaries. This could, in turn, adversely affect the value of debt and other obligations of JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its subsidiaries.
Capital
Maintaining the required level and composition of capital may impact JPMorganChase’s ability to support business activities, meet evolving regulatory requirements and distribute capital to shareholders.
JPMorganChase is subject to various regulatory capital requirements, including leverage- and risk-based capital requirements. In addition, as a Global Systemically Important Bank (“GSIB”), JPMorganChase is required to hold additional capital buffers, including a GSIB surcharge, a Stress Capital Buffer (“SCB”), and a countercyclical buffer, each of which is reassessed at least annually. The amount of capital that JPMorganChase is required to hold in order
