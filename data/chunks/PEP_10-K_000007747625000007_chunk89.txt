Tax Cuts and Jobs Act
In 2022, we recorded $
86
million ($
0.06
per share) of net tax expense related to the TCJ Act as a result of correlating adjustments related to a partial audit settlement with the IRS for tax years 2014 through 2019
.
As of December 28, 2024, our mandatory transition tax liability was $
1.7
billion, which must be paid through 2026 under the provisions of the TCJ Act. We reduced our liability through cash payments and application of tax overpayments by $
579
million in
2024
, and $
309
million in each of 2023 and 2022. We currently expect to pay approximately $
772
million of this liability in 2025.
The TCJ Act also created a requirement that certain income earned by foreign subsidiaries, known as global intangible low-tax income (GILTI), must be included in the gross income of their U.S. shareholder. The FASB allows an accounting policy election of either recognizing deferred taxes for temporary differences expected to reverse as GILTI in future years or recognizing such taxes as a current-period expense when incurred. We elected to treat the tax effect of GILTI as a current-period expense when incurred.
Other Tax Matters
On October 29, 2021, we filed a formal written protest of a final assessment from the IRS audit for the tax years 2014 through 2016 and requested an appeals conference.
In 2022, we came to an agreement with the IRS to settle one of the issues assessed in the 2014 through 2016 tax audit. The agreement covers tax years 2014 through 2019. As a result, we reduced our reserves for uncertain tax positions, including any correlating adjustments impacting the mandatory transition tax liability under the TCJ Act, resulting in a net non-cash tax benefit of $
233
million ($
0.17
per share) in 2022. Tax years 2014 through 2019 remain under audit for other issues.
In 2024 and 2023, tax benefits of $
54
