RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
R&D is at the heart of fulfilling our purpose to deliver breakthroughs that change patients’ lives as we work to translate advanced science and technologies into the medicines and vaccines that may be the most impactful for patients. In addition to discovering and developing new products, our R&D efforts seek to add value to our existing products by improving their safety, efficacy and ease of dosing and by discovering potential new indications.
Our R&D Priorities and Strategy.
Our R&D priorities include:
•
delivering a pipeline of highly differentiated medicines and vaccines where we have a unique opportunity to bring the most important new therapies to patients in need;
•
