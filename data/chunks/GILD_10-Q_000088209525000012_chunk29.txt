to Gilead of $3.34 for the same period in 2024. The increase was primarily due to:
•
A $3.9 billion acquired in-process research and development (“IPR&D”) expense related to the acquisition of CymaBay Therapeutics, Inc. (“CymaBay”) during the three months ended March 31, 2024, which did not repeat; and
•
A pre-tax IPR&D partial impairment charge of $2.4 billion during the three months ended March 31, 2024 related to Trodelvy IPR&D assets acquired by Gilead from Immunomedics, Inc., which did not repeat; partially offset by
•
Higher income tax expense; and
•
Higher net unrealized losses on equity investments.
