KCM
364-Day
Revolving Credit Facility
On April 2, 2025, KKR Capital Markets Holdings L.P. and certain other capital markets subsidiaries (the "KCM Borrowers") replaced their existing
364-day
revolving credit agreement with a new
364-day
revolving credit agreement (the "KCM
364-Day
Revolving Credit Facility”) with Mizuho Bank, Ltd., as administrative agent, and one or more lenders party thereto. The KCM
364-Day
Revolving Credit Facility replaced the prior
364-day
revolving credit facility, dated as of April 4, 2024, between the KCM Borrowers and the administrative agent, and one or more lenders party to the prior facility, which was terminated according to its terms on April 2, 2025. The KCM
364-Day
Revolving Credit Facility provides for revolving borrowings up to $
750
million, expires on April 1, 2026, and ranks pari passu with the existing $
750
million
5-year
revolving credit facility provided by them for KKR's capital markets business (the "KCM
Five-Year
Revolving Credit Facility").  If a borrowing is made under the KCM
364-Day
Revolving Credit Agreement, the interest rate will vary depending on the type of drawdown requested.  As with the KCM Five-Year Revolving Credit Facility, borrowings under the KCM
364-Day
Revolving Credit Facility may only be used for KKR’s capital markets business. This facility’s only obligors are entities involved in KKR’s capital markets business, and its liabilities are non-recourse to other parts of KKR’s business. The KCM
364-Day
Revolving Credit Facility contains customary representations and warranties, events of default, and affirmative and negative covenants, including a financial covenant providing for a maximum debt to equity ratio for the KCM Borrowers, which are substantially similar to those found in the KCM Five-Year Revolving Credit Facility. The KCM Borrowers' obligations under the KCM
364-Day
Revolving Credit Facility are secured by certain assets of the KCM Borrowers, including a pledge of equity interests of certain subsidiaries of the KCM Borrowers.
Other Asset Management and Strategic Holdings Debt Obligations
Certain of KKR's consolidated investment funds have entered into financing arrangements with financial institutions, generally to provide liquidity to such investment funds. These financing arrangements are generally not direct obligations of the general partners of KKR's investment funds (beyond KKR's capital interest) or its management companies. Such borrowings have varying maturities and bear interest at floating rates. Borrowings are generally secured by the investment purchased with the proceeds of the borrowing and/or the uncalled capital commitment of each respective fund. When an investment vehicle borrows, the proceeds are available only for use by that investment vehicle and are not available for the benefit of other investment vehicles or KKR.
