inconsistent with our terms, contracts or policies. We may also be unsuccessful in our efforts to enforce our policies or otherwise remediate any such incidents. Consequences of any of the foregoing developments include negative effects on merchant and buyer trust and engagement, harm to our reputation and brands, changes to our business practices in a manner adverse to our business and adverse effects on our business and financial results. Any such developments may also subject us to litigation and regulatory inquiries, which could divert management's time and attention and subject us to monetary penalties and damages or other remedies.

It is possible that the increased costs associated with these liabilities could negatively impact our operations.
