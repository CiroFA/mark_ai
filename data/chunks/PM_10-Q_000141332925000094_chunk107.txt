party contract distributors, manufacturers or service providers.
We increasingly rely on third-parties and their subcontractors/suppliers, sometimes concentrated in a specific geographic area, for product distribution and to manufacture some of our products and product parts (particularly, the electronic devices and

accessories), as well as to provide services, including to support our finance, commercialization and information technology processes. While many of these arrangements improve efficiencies and decrease our operating costs, they also diminish our direct control.  Such diminished control may lead to disruption in the distribution of our products and may have a material adverse effect on the quality and availability of products or services, our supply chain, and the speed and flexibility in our response to changing market conditions and adult consumer preferences, all of which may place us at a competitive disadvantage or negatively impact our reputation. In addition, we may be unable to renew these agreements on satisfactory terms for numerous reasons, including government regulations, and the distribution of our products may be disrupted in certain markets or our costs may increase significantly if we must replace such third parties with other partners or our own resources.
The effects of climate change, other environmental issues, and related legal or regulatory responses may have a negative impact on our business and results of operations.
While we seek to mitigate our business risks associated with environmental issues, such as climate change, by enhancing our resilience to potential impacts on our business, establishing environmental goals and standards and seeking business partners, including within our supply chain, that are committed to operating in ways that protect the environment or mitigate environmental impacts, we recognize that there are inherent environmental-related risks, including climate change-related risks, wherever business is conducted. Among other potential impacts, climate change could influence the quality and volume of the agricultural products we rely on, including tobacco, due to several factors beyond our control, including more frequent variations in weather patterns, extreme weather events causing unexpected downtime and inventory losses, other adverse weather conditions, and governmental restrictions on trade, all of which may lead to disruption of operations at factories, warehouses and other premises.
Furthermore, nature-related risks, including those related to natural ecosystems degradation, decreased agricultural productivity in certain regions of the world, biodiversity loss, water resource depletion and deforestation, which are partially driven or exacerbated by climate change, may negatively impact the resilience of, or otherwise disrupt, our business operations or those of our suppliers and business partners.
There is a continued and, in some cases, increased focus by
