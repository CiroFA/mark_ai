issue common shares through external offerings during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, or 2022.
In conjunction with its acquisition of Ameritrade in 2020, the Company issued shares of a nonvoting class of CSC common stock to TD Bank and its affiliates. Each share of nonvoting common stock has identical rights to common stock, including liquidation and dividend rights, except that holders of nonvoting common stock have no voting rights other than over matters that significantly and adversely affect the rights or preferences of the nonvoting common stock, or as required by applicable law. Holders of nonvoting common stock are restricted from transferring shares except for permitted inside or outside transfers, as defined in the Company’s certificate of incorporation. Shares of nonvoting common stock transferred in a permitted outside transfer are automatically converted to shares of common stock.
On August 1, 2022, an affiliate of TD Bank executed a permitted outside transfer of
13
million shares of CSC nonvoting common stock, upon which the shares of nonvoting common stock automatically converted to shares of common stock. Following this transfer and CSC’s repurchase of nonvoting common stock described below, TD Bank and its affiliates held approximately
51
million shares of nonvoting common stock as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2024.
Share Repurchase Program
On July 27, 2022, CSC publicly announced that its Board of Directors approved a share repurchase authorization to repurchase up to $
15.0
billion of common stock, replacing the previous and now terminated share repurchase authorization of up to $
4.0
billion of common stock. The share repurchase authorization does not have an expiration date.
On August 1, 2022, CSC purchased, directly from an affiliate of TD Bank,
15
million shares of nonvoting common stock for a total of $
1.0
billion, or approximately $
66.53
per share. The shares of nonvoting common stock automatically converted into common stock and were purchased under CSC’s share repurchase authorization. The purchase price paid by CSC was equal to the lowest price per share that the affiliate of TD Bank received in a contemporaneous share sale facilitated by a third-party market maker, which resulted in a purchase price lower than the closing price on August 1, 2022. CSC repurchased an additional
32
million shares of its common stock under the authorization for $
2.4
billion during the year ended December 31, 2022.
CSC repurchased
37
million shares of its common stock for $
2.8
billion during the year ended December 31, 2023. There were
no
repurchases of CSC’s common stock during the year ended December 31, 2024. As of December 31, 2024, approximately $
8.7
billion remained on the new authorization.
Share repurchases, net of issuances, are subject to a nondeductible excise tax which was recognized as a direct and incremental cost associated with these transactions.
Subsequent to December 31, 2024, TD Bank and its
