MK-7264, gefapixant, is a non-narcotic, oral selective P2X3 receptor antagonist for the treatment of refractory or unexplained chronic cough in adults. In December 2023, the FDA issued a second CRL regarding the resubmission of Merck’s NDA for gefapixant. In the CRL, the FDA concluded that Merck’s application did not meet substantial evidence of effectiveness for treating refractory or unexplained chronic cough. The CRL was not related to the safety of gefapixant. Merck has withdrawn its application for gefapixant from the FDA and does not plan to refile.

In December 2024, Merck announced the discontinuation of the Phase 3 KeyVibe-003 and KeyVibe-007 trials, which were evaluating MK-7684A, the fixed-dose combination of vibostolimab, an anti-TIGIT antibody, and pembrolizumab, in certain patients with NSCLC, based on the recommendation of an independent data monitoring committee. In a pre-planned analysis, both trials met the pre-specified futility criteria for the primary endpoint of overall survival. Considering the totality of data from the Phase 3 KeyVibe studies, including the efficacy outcomes from KeyVibe-003 and KeyVibe-007, the Company decided to discontinue the Phase 3 KeyVibe-006 trial and other vibostolimab studies.

Also in December 2024, Merck announced the discontinuation of the clinical development program for favezelimab, an anti-LAG-3 antibody, and will stop enrollment in the Phase 3 KEYFORM-008 trial evaluating the fixed-dose combination of favezelimab and pembrolizumab (MK-4280A) in patients with relapsed or refractory cHL whose disease has progressed following prior anti-PD-1 therapy. The Company made this decision after a thorough evaluation of data from the favezelimab clinical program. Data analyses for the Phase 3 trials are ongoing, and the results will be shared with the scientific community.
•
Based on the topline results of the MK-2060 Phase 2 study, Merck will not proceed to Phase 3 clinical development. The Phase 2 study results will be presented at a scientific meeting later in 2025.

The Phase 2b clinical trial for MK-8189 as a monotherapy for acute schizophrenia did not meet its primary efficacy endpoint and further development in schizophrenia, bipolar, and dementia indications has stopped. Potential alternative indications for MK-8189 are being explored.
