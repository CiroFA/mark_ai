No

no
BPAs were outstanding as of December 31, 2024.
The Amended and Restated 2019 Stock Plan (2019 Plan) replaced and superseded the original 2019 Stock Plan. The 2019 Plan provides for
320
million shares to be authorized for grants plus any shares remaining available for grant under the original 2019 Stock Plan as of April 25, 2024 (the carryforward shares). The RSUs count as
three
shares, and PPSs, PSAs and BPAs count as
three
shares times the maximum potential payout, while TSRUs and stock options count as
one
share, toward the maximum shares available under the 2019 Plan. As of December 31, 2024,
441
million shares were available for award. Although not required to do so, we have used authorized and unissued shares and, to a lesser extent, treasury stock to satisfy our obligations under these programs.
