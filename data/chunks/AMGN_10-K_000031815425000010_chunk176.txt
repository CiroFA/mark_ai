Leases
We lease certain facilities and equipment related primarily to R&D, administrative and commercial activities. Leases with terms of 12 months or less are expensed as incurred and are not recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Most leases include one or more options to renew, with renewal terms that may extend the lease term up to
ten years

Our lease agreements neither contain residual value guarantees nor impose significant restrictions or covenants. We sublease certain real estate to third parties. Our sublease portfolio consists of operating leases from former R&D and administrative spaces.
