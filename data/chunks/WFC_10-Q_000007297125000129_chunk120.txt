Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments
Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments include economic hedges and derivatives entered into for customer accommodation trading purposes.
Economic hedge derivatives do not qualify for, or we have elected not to apply, hedge accounting. We use economic hedge derivatives to manage our non-trading exposures to interest rate risk, equity price risk, foreign currency risk, and credit risk.
For additional information on other derivatives, see Note 14 (Derivatives) in our 2024 Form 10-K.
Table 11.6 shows the net gains (losses) related to economic hedge derivatives. Gains (losses) on customer accommodation trading derivatives are excluded from Table 11.6. For additional information, see Note 2 (Trading Activities).
