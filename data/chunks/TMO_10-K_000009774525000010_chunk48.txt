Principles of Consolidation
The accompanying financial statements include the accounts of the company and its wholly and majority-owned subsidiaries. All material intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.
Redeemable Noncontrolling Interest
The company owns
60

Presentation
Certain reclassifications of prior year amounts have been made to conform to the current year presentation.
Amounts and percentages reported within these consolidated financial statements are presented and calculated based on underlying unrounded amounts. As a result, the sum of components may not equal corresponding totals due to rounding.
