deferred taxes and other non-cash taxes related to the VMware Merger.
Investing Activities
Cash flows from investing activities primarily consisted of cash used for acquisitions, proceeds from the sale of a business, capital expenditures, and proceeds and payments related to investments. The $22,381 million increase in cash used in investing activities for fiscal year 2024 compared to fiscal year 2023 was primarily due to a $25,925 million increase in cash used for acquisitions due to the VMware Merger and the acquisition of Seagate’s SoC operations, net of cash acquired, offset in part by $3,485 million proceeds from the sale of the EUC business.
Financing Activities
Cash flows from financing activities primarily consisted of proceeds and payments related to our long-term borrowings, dividend payments, stock repurchases, and employee withholding tax payments related to net settled equity awards. The $13,890 million increase in cash flows from financing activities for fiscal year 2024 compared to fiscal year 2023 was primarily due to $39,954 million of net proceeds from the 2023 Term Loans and the issuance of senior notes, offset in part by a $19,205 million increase in payments on debt obligations, a $3,355 million increase in employee withholding tax payments related to net settled equity awards, a $2,169 million increase in dividend payments, and a $1,352 million increase in stock repurchases.
ITEM 7A.     QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
Foreign Currency Exchange Risk
From time to time, we use foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge a portion of our exposures to changes in currency exchange rates, which result from our global operating and financing activities. We do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. A hypothetical 10% change in currency exchange rates would not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

Interest Rate Risk
Changes in interest rates affect the fair value of our outstanding fixed rate senior notes. As of November 3, 2024 and October 29, 2023, we had $56.3 billion and $40.8 billion in principal amount of fixed rate senior notes outstanding, and the estimated aggregate fair value of these senior notes was $51.4 billion and $33.2 billion, respectively. As of November 3, 2024 and October 29, 2023, a hypothetical 50 basis point increase or decrease in market interest rates would change the fair value of our fixed rate senior notes by approximately $1.7 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively. However, this hypothetical change in interest rates would not impact the interest expense on our fixed rate senior notes outstanding. To hedge variability of cash flows due to changes in the benchmark interest rate of anticipated future debt issuances, we have entered, and in the future may enter, into treasury rate lock contracts.
As of November 3, 2024, we had $13.6 billion of outstanding 2023 Term Loans, which are subject to
