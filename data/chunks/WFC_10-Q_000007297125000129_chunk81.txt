INTEREST RATE RISK.
Interest rate risk is the risk that market fluctuations in interest rates, credit spreads, or foreign exchange can cause a loss of the Company’s earnings and capital stemming from mismatches in the cash flows of the Company’s assets and liabilities.
We are subject to interest rate risk because:
•
assets and liabilities may mature or reprice at different times or by different amounts;
•
short-term and long-term market interest rates may change independently or with different magnitudes;
•
the remaining maturity for various assets or liabilities may shorten or lengthen as interest rates change; or
•
interest rates may also have a direct or indirect effect on loan demand, collateral values, credit losses, loan origination volume, and the fair value of financial instruments and MSRs.
We measure interest rate risk exposure from customer-related lending and deposit-taking activities, as well as from investments in AFS and HTM debt securities and from issuances of long-term debt. Interest rate risk is measured by comparing the earnings outcomes from multiple interest rate scenarios relative to our base scenario. The base scenario is a reference point used by the Company for financial planning purposes. These scenarios may differ in the direction of interest rate changes, the degree and speed of interest rate changes over time, and the projected shape of the yield curve. They also require assumptions regarding drivers of earnings and balance sheet composition such as loan originations, prepayment rates on loans and debt securities, deposit flows and mix, as well as pricing strategies. We periodically assess and enhance our scenarios and assumptions.
Table 22 presents the results of the estimated net interest income sensitivity over the next 12 months from the multiple scenarios compared with our base scenario. These hypothetical scenarios include instantaneous movements across the yield curve with both lower and higher interest rates under a parallel shift, as well as steeper and flatter non-parallel changes in the yield curve. Long-term interest rates are defined as all tenors three years and longer, and short-term interest rates are defined as all tenors less than three years. CIB Markets trading net interest income is excluded from the sensitivity analysis since CIB Markets trading net interest income may be offset by trading-related noninterest income. For additional information on the market risk of financial instruments used in our trading activities, which are measured at fair value through earnings, see the “Risk Management – Asset/Liability Management – Market Risk – Trading Activities” section in this Report.
Our scenario assumptions reflected the following:
•
Scenarios are dynamic and reflect anticipated changes to our assets and liabilities over time.
•
