OPERATING SEGMENTS
The operating segments and reporting units reflect how the CEO, who is the chief operating decision maker (CODM), manages the Company, including allocating resources and measuring performance.
Citi is organized into
five
reportable operating segments:
Services
,
Markets
,
Banking
,
Wealth
and
U.S. Personal Banking (USPB)
, with the remaining operations recorded in
All Other
, which includes activities not assigned to a specific reportable operating segment, as well as discontinued operations.
Operating segment results have been revised to reflect the following changes:
•
Reallocated certain deposit balances from
Markets
to
All Other
, to consolidate funding strategies across the Company. This change had no material impact to operating results of
Markets
or
All Other.
•
Realigned businesses engaged in financing and securitization activities within
Banking
and
Markets
, transferred the retail banking business in the U.K., which is being wound down, from
Wealth
to
All Other
and made other immaterial reclassifications to align with Citi’s transformation and strategy. These reclassifications did not materially change segment or
All Other
results, and prior periods were conformed to reflect these changes.
•
Reallocated certain customer balances between
All Other—
Legacy Franchises,
Services
,
Markets
and
Banking
in preparation for the IPO of the Mexico Consumer/SBMM operations, and made other immaterial reclassifications. These reallocations and reclassifications did not materially change segment or
