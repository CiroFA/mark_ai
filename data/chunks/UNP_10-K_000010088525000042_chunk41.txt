Center to prevent derailments. We utilize our autonomous geometry car fleet to inspect 500,000 miles of track annually. This technology and the data it provides enable us to direct investments and resources in the right place, helping to significantly reduce track-caused derailments over the last 10 years.
Situational Awareness Testing (a program we call COMMIT) is our program that observes, tests, and coaches our employees to promote understanding and compliance with our work rules. This goes beyond the classroom, with an emphasis on being in the field with the employees as they are performing the activities that run the railroad.
Peer-to-Peer Engagement is driving employee ownership through engagement with our safety programs. This is our culture, a personal commitment to do our jobs with a passion for safety so everyone goes home safely. Employees are encouraged to speak up if they see unsafe behaviors.

Service
– Service performance index for both intermodal and manifest products improved 2 and 4 points, respectively, compared to 2023. Throughout the year we improved network fluidity as reflected in 2% faster freight car velocity and record terminal dwell, improved 3% from 2023.

Operational Excellence
– Network performance throughout 2024 was strong. While we experienced some powerful weather events in the second quarter and a second half surge in international intermodal shipments, most of our operating metrics improved year-over year. We maintained a resource buffer that allowed us to strategically integrate crews, locomotives, and freight cars into the network to efficiently handle the growth and recover from the weather events.

Financial Results
– Core pricing gains, strong productivity, and 3% volume growth positively impacted our financial results. Operating income of $9.7 billion increased 7% from 2023, and our operating ratio was 59.9%, improving 2.4 points from 2023. Net income of $6.7 billion translated into earnings of $11.09 per diluted share, up 6% from 2023.
We generated $9.3 billion of cash provided by operating activities, yielded free cash flow of $2.8 billion after reductions of $3.3 billion for cash used in investing activities and $3.2 billion in dividends paid. Both cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow were higher by $384 million due to payments in 2023 related to back wages for agreements reached with our labor unions.
