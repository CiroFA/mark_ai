8. Unpaid losses and loss expenses
Chubb establishes reserves for the estimated unpaid ultimate liability for losses and loss expenses under the terms of its policies and agreements. Reserves include estimates for both claims that have been reported and for IBNR claims, and include estimates of expenses associated with processing and settling these claims. Reserves are recorded in Unpaid losses and loss expenses in the Consolidated balance sheets. While we believe that our reserves for unpaid losses and loss expenses at December 31, 2024, are adequate, new information or trends may lead to future developments in incurred loss and loss expenses significantly greater or less than the reserves provided. Any such revisions could result in future changes in estimates of losses or reinsurance recoverable and would be reflected in our results of operations in the period in which the estimates are changed.
The following table presents a reconciliation of beginning and ending Unpaid losses and loss expenses:
(1)
Net of valuation allowance for uncollectible reinsurance.
(2)
Relates to prior period loss reserve development only and excludes prior period development related to reinstatement premiums, expense adjustments, earned premiums, and A&H long-duration lines totaling $
119
million, $
83
million, and $
232
million for 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.
The increase in net unpaid losses and loss expense in 2024 principally reflects underlying exposure growth and net catastrophe losses, partially offset by the impact of favorable prior period development and foreign exchange movement. The increase in gross and net unpaid losses and loss expense in 2023 reflects underlying exposure growth and the consolidation of Huatai, partially offset by favorable prior period development.
