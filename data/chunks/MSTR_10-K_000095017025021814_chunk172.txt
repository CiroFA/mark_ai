Share-settled restricted stock units
Share-settled restricted stock units granted under the Stock Incentive Plans entitle recipients to receive a number of shares of the Company’s class A common stock over a vesting period, as specified in the applicable restricted stock unit agreement. Although the Company may in its sole discretion elect to pay fully or partially in cash in lieu of settling solely in shares, it does not currently intend to do so.
Share-based compensation expense related to share-settled restricted stock units is based on the fair value of the Company’s class A common stock on the date of grant. The Company recognizes share-based compensation expense associated with such share-settled restricted stock unit awards on a straight-line basis over the award’s requisite service period (generally, the vesting period).  With the exception of share-settled restricted stock unit awards to non-employee members of the Company’s Board of Directors, which vest in full after
one year
, the share-settled restricted stock unit awards granted to date vest in equal annual installments over a
four-year
period (unless accelerated in connection with a change in control event under specified conditions as set forth in the applicable restricted stock unit agreement or otherwise in accordance with provisions of the Stock Incentive Plan or applicable restricted stock unit agreement). In the second quarter of 2024, the Company transitioned from a “net settlement” approach, which it previously used in nearly all jurisdictions in which restricted stock units were granted, to generally using a “sell-to-cover” approach for settling its share-settled restricted stock units.  Under a “net settlement” approach, when settling restricted stock units, the Company withholds shares equal in value to the statutory withholding obligations and pays the tax
