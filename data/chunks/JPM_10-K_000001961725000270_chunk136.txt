JPMorganChase’s ability to attract and retain qualified employees is critical to its success.
JPMorganChase’s employees are its most important resource, and in many areas of the financial services industry, competition for qualified personnel is intense. JPMorganChase endeavors to attract talented  new employees from a variety of backgrounds and retain, develop and motivate its existing employees. JPMorganChase's efforts to hire and retain talented  employees could be hindered by factors such as:
•
the emerging need for more-skilled workers in an evolving labor and workplace environment, including due to changes in technology
•
targeted recruitment of JPMorganChase employees by competitors, and
•
modifications to or discontinuation of JPMorganChase's hybrid work models.
JPMorganChase's performance and competitive position could be materially and adversely affected if it is unable to attract or retain qualified employees for its workforce or to devise and execute effective succession planning for key leadership roles, such as the Chief Executive Officer, members of the Operating Committee and other senior leaders.
In addition, advances in technology, such as automation and artificial intelligence, may lead to workforce displacement. This could require JPMorganChase to invest in additional employee training, manage impacts on morale and retention, and compete for employment candidates who possess more advanced technological skills, all of which could
have a negative impact on JPMorganChase's business and operations.
