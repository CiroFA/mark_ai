abandonment of wells and removal and disposal of offshore oil and gas platforms around the world, as well as oil and gas production facilities and pipelines in Alaska.
During 2024 and 2023, our overall ARO changed as follows:
Accrued Environmental Costs
Total accrued environmental costs at December 31, 2024 and 2023, were $
206
million and $
184
million, respectively.
We had accrued environmental costs of $
139
million and $
112
million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, related to remediation activities in the U.S. and Canada. We had also accrued in Corporate and Other $
56
million and $
55
million of environmental costs associated with sites no longer in operation at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. In addition, December 31, 2024 and 2023, included a $
11
million and $
17
million accrual, respectively, where the company has been named a potentially responsible party under the CERCLA, or similar state laws. Accrued environmental liabilities are expected to be paid over periods extending up to
30
years.
Expected expenditures for environmental obligations acquired in various business combinations are discounted using a weighted-average
5
percent discount factor, resulting in an
accrued balance for acquired environmental liabilities
of $
112
million at December 31, 2024. The total expected future undiscounted payments related to the portion of the accrued environmental costs that have been discounted are $
158
million.
