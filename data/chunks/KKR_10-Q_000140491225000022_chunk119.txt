On April 8, 2024, after receiving permission from the Kentucky trial court in the 2020 AG Action, the Kentucky AG amended its complaint in the 2020 AG Action to add a claim for breach of contract. The Kentucky AG also filed an action (the "2024 AG Action") substantially identical to the 2020 AG Action, including the new claim for breach of contract. On April 23, 2024, KKR & Co. Inc., Messrs. Kravis and Roberts and other defendants moved to strike the Kentucky AG's amended complaint in the 2020 AG Action, to stay consideration of the breach of contract claim and the 2024 AG Action until after the trial court's ruling on the motions to dismiss the 2020 AG Action, and to deny a motion by the Kentucky AG to consolidate the 2020 AG Action and the 2024 AG Action. These motions were denied, and the trial court consolidated the 2020 AG Action with the 2024 AG Action. On June 17, 2024, KKR & Co. Inc., Messrs. Kravis and Roberts and other defendants filed new motions to dismiss the consolidated 2020 AG Action and 2024 AG Action.
