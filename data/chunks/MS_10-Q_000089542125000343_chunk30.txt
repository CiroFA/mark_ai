The current economic environment and changes in business and consumer behavior have adversely impacted commercial real estate borrowers due to pressure from higher interest rates, tenant lease renewals, and elevated refinancing risks for loans with near-term maturities, among other issues. While we continue to actively monitor all our loan portfolios, the commercial real estate sector remains under heightened focus given the sector’s sensitivity to economic and secular factors, credit conditions, and difficulties specific to certain property types, most notably office.
As of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024
, our lending against commercial real estate (“CRE”) properties within the Institutional Securities business segment totaled $9.9 billion and $10.7 billion, respectively. This represents 3.9% and 4.4%, respectively, of total exposure reflected in the Institutional Securities Loans and Lending Commitments table above. Those CRE loans are originated for experienced sponsors and are generally secured by specific institutional CRE properties. In many cases, loans are subsequently syndicated or s
ecuritized on a full or partial basis, reducing our ongoing exposure.
In addition to the amounts included in the table above, we provide certain secured lending facilities which are typically collateralized by pooled CRE mortgage loans and are included in Secured lending facilities in the Institutional Securities Loans and Lending Commitments Held for Investment table above. These secured lending facilities benefit from structural protections including cross-collateralization and diversification across property types.
