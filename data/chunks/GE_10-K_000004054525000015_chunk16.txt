Other operating costs* increased primarily due to higher EHS costs and higher intercompany eliminations primarily resulting from additional intercompany engine part sales volume in our Propulsion & Additive Technologies business partially offset by a reduction in our functional costs and favorability from higher bank interest.
OTHER CONSOLIDATED INFORMATION
RESTRUCTURING AND SEPARATION COSTS.
Significant, higher-cost restructuring programs, primarily related to the separations, are excluded from measurement of segment operating performance for internal and external purposes; those excluded amounts are reported in Restructuring and other charges for Corporate. In addition, we incur costs associated with separation activities, which are also excluded from measurement of segment operating performance for internal and external purposes. See Note 20 for further information on restructuring and separation costs.
INTEREST AND OTHER FINANCIAL CHARGES
were $1.0 billion, $1.0 billion and $1.3 billion for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The decrease was primarily due to lower average borrowing balances. The primary component of interest and other financial charges is interest on short- and long-term borrowings.
DEBT EXTINGUISHMENT COSTS
were zero, zero, and $0.5 billion, for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 respectively. There were no debt tenders in 2024 and 2023.

For the year ended December 31, 2024
, the effective income tax rate was 12.6% compared to 9.5% for the year ended December 31, 2023. The tax rates for both 2024 and 2023 reflect a tax provision on pre-tax income.
The provision (benefit) for income taxes was $1.0 billion and $1.0 billion for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. There was a decrease in tax primarily due to an increase in tax benefits associated with separation activities, earnings of global activities, and equity compensation, largely offset by the tax effect of the increase in pre-tax income excluding gains and losses on our retained and sold ownership interests. There was an insignificant tax on the net gains in GE HealthCare and AerCap equity in both periods because of the tax-free disposition of GE HealthCare shares and because of available capital losses.
