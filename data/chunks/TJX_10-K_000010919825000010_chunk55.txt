fiscal 2024. The increase in net sales reflects a 4% increase from comp store sales and a 2% increase from non-comp store sales, partially offset by a negative 2% estimated year-over-year impact of the 53rd week in fiscal 2024.

Segment Profit Margin
Segment profit margin increased to 14.1% for fiscal 2025 compared to a segment profit margin of 13.8% for fiscal 2024. The increase in segment profit margin was primarily driven by higher merchandise margin, partially offset by incremental store wage and payroll costs and higher occupancy and administrative costs. Merchandise margin reflects higher markon and lower inventory shrink expense.
Our Marmaxx e-commerce sites, tjmaxx.com and marshalls.com, together with sierra.com, represented less than 3% of Marmaxx’s net sales for fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2024, and did not have a significant impact on year-over-year segment margin comparisons.
In fiscal 2026, we expect to open 40 Marmaxx net new stores and approximately 20 new Sierra stores, which would increase selling square footage by approximately 2%.
