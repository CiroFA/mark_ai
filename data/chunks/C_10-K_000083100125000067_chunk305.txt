In 2015, Parmalat filed a claim in an Italian civil court in Milan claiming damages of €
1.8
billion against Citigroup, Citibank, and related parties. The Milan court dismissed Parmalat’s claim on grounds that it was duplicative of Parmalat’s previously unsuccessful claims. In 2019, the Milan Court of Appeal rejected Parmalat’s appeal of the Milan court’s dismissal. In June 2019, Parmalat filed a further appeal with the Italian Supreme Court, and a hearing took place in November 2024.

million as damages. These proceedings are currently stayed. Additional information concerning this action is publicly available in court filings under the docket number 8611/2020.
Shareholder Derivative and Securities Litigation
Beginning in October 2020, four derivative actions were filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, purportedly on behalf of Citigroup (as nominal defendant) against certain of Citigroup’s current and former directors. The actions were later consolidated under the case name IN RE CITIGROUP INC. SHAREHOLDER DERIVATIVE LITIGATION. The consolidated complaint asserts claims for breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, and contribution and indemnification in connection with defendants’ alleged failures to implement adequate internal controls. In addition, the consolidated complaint asserts derivative claims for violations of Sections 10(b) and 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 in connection with statements in Citigroup’s 2019 and 2020 annual meeting proxy statements. In February 2021, the court stayed the action pending resolution of defendants’ motion to dismiss in IN RE CITIGROUP SECURITIES LITIGATION. In April 2023, after defendants’ motion to dismiss was granted in IN RE CITIGROUP SECURITIES LITIGATION, the court maintained the stay in this action pending resolution of the securities plaintiffs’ motion for leave to amend the complaint and, if leave is granted, any subsequent motion to dismiss.
