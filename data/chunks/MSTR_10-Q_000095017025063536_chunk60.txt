future from quarter to quarter. These fluctuations could have an adverse effect on the market price of our listed securities.
Fluctuations in Quarterly Operating Results.
Our quarterly operating results may fluctuate, in part, as a result of:
•
fluctuations in the price of bitcoin, of which we have significant holdings and with respect to which we expect to continue to make significant future purchases, and potential fair value changes associated therewith;
•
any sales by us of our bitcoin at prices above or below their carrying value, which would result in our recording gains or losses upon sale of our bitcoin;
•
the incurrence of tax liabilities on future unrealized gains on our bitcoin or as result of the cumulative-effect net increase of $12.75 billion to the opening balance of our retained earnings as of January 1, 2025 in connection with the adoption of ASU 2023-08;
•
regulatory, commercial, and technical developments related to bitcoin or the Bitcoin blockchain, or digital assets more generally;
•
the incurrence of additional fixed interest charges or dividend obligations on preferred stock;
•
the impact of war, terrorism, infectious diseases, natural disasters and other global events, and government responses to such events, on the global economy and the market for and price of bitcoin;
•
significant changes to our software business, including significant changes in our software sales or operating expenses, or the timing of announcements of new offerings or research and development projects by us or our competitors;
•
our profitability and expectations for future profitability and their effect on our deferred tax balances and net income for the period in which any adjustment to our net deferred tax asset valuation allowance may be made; and
•
increases or decreases in our unrecognized tax benefits.
Limited Ability to Adjust Expenses.
We base our operating expense budgets on expected revenue trends and strategic objectives. Many of our expenses, such as interest expense on our debt, dividend obligations on our preferred stock, tax liabilities, office leases and certain personnel costs, are relatively fixed. We may be unable to adjust spending quickly enough to offset any unexpected shortfall in our cash flow. Accordingly, we may be required to take actions to pay expenses, such as selling bitcoin or using proceeds from equity or debt financings, some of which could cause significant variation in operating results in any quarter.
Based on the above factors, we believe quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our operating results are not a good indication of our future performance. It is possible that in one or more future quarters, our operating results may be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors. In that event, the market price of our listed securities may fall.

We may not be able to regain profitability in future periods
We generated a loss for the three months ended March 31, 2025 of $4.22 billion, primarily due to
