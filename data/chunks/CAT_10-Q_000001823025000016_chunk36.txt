methodology difference only impacts segment assets. We do not include goodwill amortization expense in segment profit. In addition, we have allocated to segments only a portion of goodwill for certain acquisitions made in 2011 or later.
•
We generally manage currency exposures for operating segments, other than Financial Products, at the corporate level and do not include in segment profit or segment assets the effects of changes in exchange rates on results of operations and financial position within the year. We report the net difference created in the translation of revenues and costs between exchange rates used for U.S. GAAP reporting and exchange rates used for segment reporting as a methodology difference.
•
We do not include stock-based compensation expense in segment profit.
•
Postretirement benefit expenses are split; segments are generally responsible for service costs, with the remaining elements of net periodic benefit cost included as a methodology difference.
Reconciling items are created based on accounting differences between segment reporting and our consolidated external reporting. Please refer to pages 29 to 30 for financial information regarding significant reconciling items. Most of our reconciling items are self-explanatory given the above explanations. For the reconciliation of profit, we have grouped the reconciling items as follows:
•
Corporate costs:
These costs are related to corporate requirements primarily for compliance and legal functions for the benefit of the entire organization.

Restructuring income/costs:
May include costs for employee separation, long-lived asset impairments, contract terminations and (gains)/losses on divestitures. These costs are included in Other operating (income) expenses except for defined-benefit plan curtailment losses and special termination benefits, which are included in Other income (expense). Restructuring costs also include other exit-related costs, which may consist of accelerated depreciation, inventory write-downs, building demolition, equipment relocation and project management costs and LIFO inventory decrement benefits from inventory liquidations at closed facilities, all of which are primarily included in Cost of goods sold. See Note 20 for more information.

Methodology differences:
See previous discussion of significant accounting differences between segment reporting and consolidated external reporting.
•
Timing:
Timing differences in the recognition of costs between segment reporting and consolidated external reporting. For example, we report certain costs on the cash basis for segment reporting and the accrual basis for consolidated external reporting.
