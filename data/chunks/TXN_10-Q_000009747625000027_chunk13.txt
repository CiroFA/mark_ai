that appear elsewhere in this document. In the following discussion of our results of operations:
•
Our segments represent groups of similar products that are combined on the basis of similar design and development requirements, product characteristics, manufacturing processes and distribution channels, and how management allocates resources and measures results. See Note 1 to the financial statements for more information regarding our segments.
•
When we discuss our results:
◦
Unless otherwise noted, changes in our revenue are attributable to changes in customer demand, which are evidenced by fluctuations in shipment volumes.
◦
New products do not tend to have a significant impact on our revenue in any given period because we sell such a large number of products.
◦
From time to time, our revenue and gross profit are affected by changes in demand for higher-priced or lower-priced products, which we refer to as changes in the “mix” of products shipped.

◦
Because we own much of our manufacturing capacity, a significant portion of our operating cost is fixed. When factory loadings decrease, our fixed costs are spread over reduced output and, absent other circumstances, our profit margins decrease. Conversely, as factory loadings increase, our fixed costs are spread over increased output and, absent other circumstances, our profit margins increase.

We are monitoring the geopolitical environment. Any implication to our customers, suppliers or TI’s business, including customer demand and our supply chain, is uncertain and will likely evolve. We currently do not see impact to second-quarter results.
Performance summary
Our first quarter revenue was $4.07 billion, net income was $1.18 billion and earnings per share (EPS) were $1.28.
Revenue increased 11% from the same quarter a year ago and increased 2% sequentially. All of our markets grew sequentially with the exception of a seasonal decline in personal electronics.
Our cash flow from operations of $6.2 billion for the trailing 12 months again underscored the strength of our business model, the quality of our product portfolio and the benefit of 300mm production. Free cash flow for the same period was $1.7 billion.
Over the past 12 months we invested $3.8 billion in R&D and SG&A, invested $4.7 billion in capital expenditures and returned $6.4 billion to shareholders.
Results of operations – first quarter 2025 compared with first quarter 2024
Revenue of $4.07 billion increased $408 million, or 11%, primarily due to higher revenue from Analog.
Gross profit of $2.31 billion was up $218 million, or 10%, primarily due to higher revenue, partially offset by higher manufacturing costs associated with our planned capacity expansions. As a percentage of revenue, gross profit decreased to 56.8% from 57.2%.
Operating expenses (R&D and SG&A) were
