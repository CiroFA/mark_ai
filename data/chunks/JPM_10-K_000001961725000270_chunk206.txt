Management’s discussion and analysis
Wholesale credit exposure – industry exposures
The Firm focuses on the management and diversification of its industry exposures, and pays particular attention to industries with actual or potential credit concerns.
Exposures that are deemed to be criticized align with the U.S. banking regulators’ definition of criticized exposures, which consist of the special mention, substandard and doubtful categories. Total criticized exposure, excluding loans held-for-sale and loans at fair value, was $44.7 billion and $41.4 billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023, representing approximately 3.5% and 3.3% of total wholesale credit exposure, respectively; of the $44.7 billion, $39.9 billion was performing. The increase in criticized exposure was driven by Real Estate resulting from downgrades, primarily in Multifamily and Office, and new commitments in Technology and Media, partially offset by Consumer & Retail resulting from net portfolio activity and upgrades.
