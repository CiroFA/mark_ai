of the following:
(1)    The carrying values differ from the outstanding principal amounts due to unamortized debt discounts and debt issuance costs of $
237
million and $
630
million as of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively.
(2)    Included in "Short-term debt" in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2024.
(3)    Included in "Short-term debt" in the Unaudited Consolidated Balance Sheet as of March 31, 2025.
Fair Value of Debt
At March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, the fair value of outstanding debt was approximately $
17.5
billion and $
18.8
billion, respectively, and was considered a "Level 2" fair value measurement (see Note 6). Fair value was estimated based upon actual trades at the end of the reporting period or the most recent trade available as well as the Company's stock price at the end of the reporting period. The fair value of the Company's debt in excess of the outstanding principal amount at March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024 primarily relates to the conversion premium, which is the conversion value in excess of the principal amount, on the convertible senior notes due in May 2025 (the "May 2025 Notes").
Convertible Senior Notes
See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024 for information related to the May 2025 Notes. The May 2025 Notes are convertible at a current conversion price of $
1,866.02
per share. At March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, the fair value of the May 2025 Notes was $
1.9
billion and $
2.1
billion, respectively.

Upon issuance and subsequent balance sheet-date reassessments through September 30, 2024, the conversion option of the May 2025 Notes qualified for the equity scope exception under Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 815
Derivatives and Hedging
because the Company had the option to deliver either cash or shares of the Company's common stock to satisfy the conversion premium. Under such exception, the conversion option is not required to be accounted for as a separate instrument. On November 1, 2024, the Company irrevocably elected to settle the conversion premium in cash. Upon that election, the conversion option no longer qualified for the exception and was deemed to be an embedded derivative which required bifurcation from the debt contract. Upon bifurcation of the conversion option, the Company recorded an embedded derivative liability at fair value of $
1.2
billion, a debt discount of $
783
million reducing the carrying value of the May 2025 Notes to
zero
, and a loss of $
428
million. The debt discount is amortized over the remaining term of the May 2025 Notes using the straight-line method. The fair value of the embedded derivative liability was $
1.1
billion and $
1.3
billion at March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively, and is included in "Accrued expenses and other current liabilities" in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The unamortized debt discount and
