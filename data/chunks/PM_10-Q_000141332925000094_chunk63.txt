promotion incentives, and excise taxes.  These net revenue amounts consist of the sale of our cigarettes and other tobacco products that are combusted. Other tobacco products primarily include roll-your-own and make-your-own cigarettes, pipe tobacco, cigars and cigarillos and do not include smoke-free products.
Net revenues related to smoke-free, excluding wellness and healthcare, refer to the operating revenues generated from the sale of these products, including shipping and handling charges billed to customers, net of sales and promotion incentives, and excise taxes, if applicable.  These net revenue amounts consist of the sale of our products that are not combustible tobacco products, such as heat-not-burn,  e-vapor, and oral products, as well as consumer accessories. Net revenues related to wellness and healthcare refer to the operating revenues generated from the sale of products, primarily associated with inhaled therapeutics, and oral and intra-oral delivery systems.
PMI's heat-not-burn products include licensed KT&G heat-not-burn products.
