The following is a summary of certain Consolidated Statement of Operations data for 2024 and 2023:
Gross Margin
Gross margin as a percentage of net revenue was 49% in 2024 compared to 46% in 2023. The increase in gross margin was due to a favorable shift in revenue mix of higher Data Center and Client revenues, lower Gaming revenue, partially offset by the impact of lower Embedded revenue.
Expenses
Research and Development Expenses
Research and development expenses of $6.5 billion in 2024 increased by $584 million, or 10%, compared to $5.9 billion in 2023. The increase was primarily due to higher employee-related costs due to an increase in headcount in support of our AI strategy.
Marketing, General and Administrative Expenses
Marketing, general and administrative expenses of $2.8 billion in 2024 increased by $431 million, or 18%, compared to $2.4 billion in 2023. The increase was primarily due to an increase in go-to-market activities to support our revenue growth.

Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles of $2.4 billion for 2024 decreased by $417 million, or 15%, compared to $2.8 billion in 2023. The decrease was primarily due to certain acquisition-related intangibles being fully amortized in the prior fiscal year.
