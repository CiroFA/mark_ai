although Zydus has received FDA approval for a non-automatically substitutable form of sitagliptin that differs from the form in the Company’s sitagliptin products
.
In March 2024, the Company received another Paragraph IV Certification Letter under the Hatch-Waxman Act from Azurity Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Azurity) asserting that a different sitagliptin product subject to its ANDA does not infringe the salt/polymorph patent. In May 2024, Merck filed a civil action in the U.S. District Court of Delaware alleging infringement. The case was dismissed without prejudice in July 2024. Following the dismissal, the Company granted Azurity a covenant not to assert the salt/polymorph patent against the Azurity product that is the subject of such ANDA.
Supplementary Protection Certificates (SPCs) for
Janumet
expired in April 2023 for the majority of European countries. Prior to expiration, generic companies sought revocation of the
Janumet
SPCs in a number of European countries. In February 2022, a Finnish court referred certain questions to the Court of Justice of the European Union that could impact the validity of the
Janumet
SPCs in Europe. A decision was rendered in December 2024. The decision provides guidance on points of law and does not directly apply to the
Janumet
SPCs. Thus, additional proceedings in certain countries where generic companies were prevented from launching products during the SPC period may be necessary to determine whether the SPCs are valid and if not, whether damages are appropriate. Those countries include Belgium, Czech Republic, Ireland, Finland, France, Slovakia and Switzerland. If the
Janumet
SPCs are ultimately upheld, the Company has reserved its rights related to the pursuit of damages for those countries where a generic launched prior to expiry of the
Janumet
SPC.
In October 2023, the Company filed a patent infringement lawsuit against Sawai Pharmaceuticals Co., Ltd. and Medisa Shinyaku Co., Ltd (collectively, Defendants) in the Tokyo District Court seeking an injunction to stop the manufacture, sale and offer for sale of the Defendants’ sitagliptin dihydrogen phosphate product, while the Company’s patents and patent term extensions are in force. The lawsuit is in response to the Defendants’ application for marketing authorization to sell a generic sitagliptin dihydrogen phosphate product, in the anhydrate form, which was approved in August 2023. Merck asserts that the Defendants’ activity infringes a patent term extension associated with Merck’s patent directed to the sitagliptin compound patent.
