loans that had entered the amortization period were nonperforming, of which $56 million were contractually current. Loans that have yet to enter the amortization period in our interest-only residential mortgage portfolio are primarily well-collateralized loans to our wealth management clients and have an interest-only period of three years to 10 years. Substantially all of these loans that have yet to enter the amortization period will not be required to make a fully-amortizing payment until 2026 or later.
Table 22 presents outstandings, nonperforming loans and net charge-offs by certain state concentrations for the residential mortgage portfolio. In the New York area, the New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) made up 15 percent of outstandings at both December 31, 2024 and 2023. The Los Angeles-Long Beach-Santa Ana MSA within California represented 14 percent of outstandings at both December 31, 2024 and 2023.

Home Equity
At December 31, 2024, the home equity portfolio made up six percent of the consumer portfolio and was comprised of home equity lines of credit (HELOCs), home equity loans and reverse mortgages. HELOCs generally have an initial draw period of 10 years, and after the initial draw period ends, the loans generally convert to 15- or 20-year amortizing loans. We no longer originate home equity loans or reverse mortgages.
At December 31, 2024, 85 percent of the home equity portfolio was in
Consumer Banking
, 10 percent was in
GWIM
and the remainder of the portfolio was in
All Other.
Outstanding balances in the home equity portfolio increased $210 million in 2024 primarily due to draws on existing lines and new
originations outpacing paydowns. Of the total home equity portfolio at December 31, 2024 and 2023, $9.2 billion and $10.1 billion, or 36 percent and 39 percent, were in first-lien positions. At December 31, 2024, outstanding balances in the home equity portfolio that were in a second-lien or more junior-lien position and where we also held the first-lien loan totaled $4.5 billion, or 18 percent, of our total home equity portfolio.
Unused HELOCs totaled $44.3 billion and $45.1 billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023. The HELOC utilization rate was 36 percent and 35 percent at December 31, 2024 and 2023.
