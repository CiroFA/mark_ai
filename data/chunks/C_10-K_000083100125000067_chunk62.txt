Russia–Ukraine war and the conflicts in the Middle East, which could expose Citi to heightened risk of insider threat, cyber threats from nation-state actors, hacktivism or other cyber incidents.
Citi continues to experience increased exposure to cyberattacks through third parties, in part because financial institutions are becoming increasingly interconnected with central agents, exchanges and clearing houses. Third parties with which Citi does business, as well as retailers and other third parties with which Citi’s customers do business, and any such third parties’ downstream service providers, also pose cybersecurity risks, particularly where activities of customers are beyond Citi’s security and control systems. For example, Citi outsources certain functions, such as processing customer credit card transactions, uploading content on customer-facing websites and developing software for new products and services. These relationships allow for the storage and processing of customer information by third-party hosting of, or access to, Citi websites. This could lead to compromise or the potential to introduce vulnerable or malicious code, resulting in security breaches or business disruptions impacting Citi customers, employees or operations. While many of Citi’s agreements with third parties include indemnification provisions, Citi may not be able to recover sufficiently under these provisions, or at all, to adequately offset any losses and other adverse impacts Citi may incur from third-party cyber incidents.
Citi and some of its third-party partners have been subjected to attempted and sometimes successful cyberattacks over the last several years, including (i) denial of service attacks, which attempt to interrupt service to clients and customers; (ii) hacking and malicious software installations intended to gain unauthorized access to information systems or to disrupt those systems and/or impact availability or privacy of confidential data, with objectives including, but not limited to, extortion payments or causing reputational damage; (iii) data breaches due to unauthorized access to customer account or other data; and (iv) malicious software attacks on client systems, in attempts to gain unauthorized access to Citi systems or client data under the guise of normal client transactions.
While Citi’s monitoring and protection services have historically generally succeeded in detecting, thwarting and/or responding to attacks targeting its systems before they become significant, certain past incidents resulted in limited losses, as well as increases in expenditures to monitor against the threat of similar future cyber incidents. There can be no assurance that such cyber incidents will not occur again, and they could occur more frequently, via novel tactics, including leveraging of tools made possible by emerging technologies, and on a more significant scale.
Despite the significant resources Citi allocates to implement, maintain, monitor and
