Indebtedness
Our level and terms of indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to further execute on our bitcoin strategy, fund our enterprise analytics software operations, and take advantage of new business opportunities
As of December 31, 2024, we had $7.274 billion aggregate indebtedness, consisting of $1.05 billion aggregate principal amount of 2027 Convertible Notes, $1.01 billion aggregate principal amount of 2028 Convertible Notes, $3.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 2029 Convertible Notes, $800.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2030 Convertible Notes, $603.8 million aggregate principal amount of 2031 Convertible Notes, $800.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2032 Convertible Notes, and $9.8 million of other long-term indebtedness. We refer herein to the 2027 Convertible Notes, 2028 Convertible Notes, 2029 Convertible Notes, 2030 Convertible Notes, 2031 Convertible Notes, and 2032 Convertible Notes, collectively, as the “Convertible Notes.” As of December 31, 2024, our annual contractual interest expense relating to our Convertible Notes was $34.6 million.
Our substantial indebtedness and interest expense could have important consequences to us, including:
•
limiting our ability to use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations in other areas of our business, including for acquisition of additional bitcoin, working capital, research and development, expanding our infrastructure, capital expenditures, and other general business activities and investment opportunities in our company, because we must dedicate a substantial portion of these funds to pay interest on and/or service our debt;
•
limiting our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for acquisition of additional bitcoin, working capital, capital expenditures, debt service, acquisitions, execution of our strategy, and other expenses or investments planned by us;
•
limiting our flexibility and our ability to capitalize on business opportunities and to react to competitive pressures and adverse changes in government regulation, our business, and our industry;
•
increasing our vulnerability to a downturn in our business and to adverse economic and industry conditions generally;

•
placing us at a competitive disadvantage as compared to our competitors that are less leveraged; and
•
limiting our ability, or increasing the costs, to refinance indebtedness.
We may be unable to service our indebtedness, which could cause us to default on our debt obligations and could force us into bankruptcy or liquidation
Our ability to make scheduled payments on and to refinance our indebtedness depends on and is subject to our financial and operating performance, which is influenced, in part, by general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory, counterparty business, and other risks that are beyond our control, including the availability of financing in the U.S. banking and capital markets.
