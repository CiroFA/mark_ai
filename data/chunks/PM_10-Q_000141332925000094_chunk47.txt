against Sojitz, PMJL’s importer and distributor, for alleged infringement of
two
patents by
TEREA
consumables.  FTKK asserts a claim for damages. PMJL is obligated to indemnify Sojitz for damages and intervened in the matters. Merits briefing in the matters commenced in December 2024. Between November 2024 and March 2025, FTKK filed
nine
additional patent infringement actions against Sojitz for alleged infringement of
nine
new FTKK patents by
TEREA
and
SENTIA
consumables.  FTKK asserts a claim for damages in these actions. Between February 2025 and March 2025, FTKK filed
four
patent infringement actions against Sojitz seeking a preliminary injunction. The patents FTKK has asserted in each of these actions were previously asserted by FTKK in earlier filed (and still pending) actions seeking monetary damages. PMJL is obligated to indemnify Sojitz for damages and has intervened, or will intervene, in all of these matters. Merits briefing in these matters either has commenced or is expected to commence in the first half of 2025. On November 27, 2024, we were informed that FTKK filed a new application with Tokyo Customs against Sojitz, PMJL’s importer and distributor, on the basis of alleged infringement of another FTKK patent.  FTKK is seeking an order to stop the importation of
TEREA
and
SENTIA
consumables. At this time, FTKK is not seeking any monetary damages or costs. PMJL has entered an appearance in the proceeding as an interested party and filed its opposition to FTKK’s application on January 9, 2025. A hearing before Customs officials was held on March 31, 2025. On January 9, 2025, PMJL and Sojitz filed a declaratory judgment action against FTKK in Tokyo District Court with respect to the patent at issue in the pending Tokyo Customs matter seeking a declaration that FTKK is not entitled to damages on the basis that the relevant patent is not infringed or is invalid. On April 16, 2025, expert advisors to Tokyo Customs provided their opinion that the patent at issue in the Customs matter is not infringed. Tokyo Customs is expected to issue a formal ruling on the matter in late April or May 2025. PMJL intends to vigorously defend the matters commenced by FTKK and take steps to mitigate disruption, if any, that could result from FTKK’s claims.
Other patent challenges are pending in various jurisdictions.
We are also involved in additional litigation arising in the ordinary course of our business. While the outcomes of these proceedings are uncertain, management does not expect that the ultimate outcomes of other litigation, including any reasonably possible losses in excess of current accruals, will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position.
