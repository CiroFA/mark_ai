FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS
Recurring Fair Value Measurements
The following table summarizes the types of assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis by level within the fair value hierarchy:
_______________________________
(1)
During the three months ended March 31, 2024, we sold all of our available-for-sale debt securities and used the proceeds to partially fund our acquisition of CymaBay Therapeutics, Inc. (“CymaBay”) discussed in Note 6. Acquisitions.
(2)
Publicly traded equity securities include our investment in Arcellx, Inc. (“Arcellx”) of $
515

Level 2 Inputs
Available-for-Sale Debt Securities
For our available-for-sale debt securities, we estimate the fair values by reviewing trading activity and pricing as of the measurement date and by taking into consideration valuations obtained from third-party pricing services. The pricing services utilize industry standard valuation models, including both income-based and market-based approaches, for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly, to estimate the fair value. These inputs include reported trades of and broker/dealer quotes on the same or similar securities, issuer credit spreads, benchmark securities, prepayment/default projections based on historical data and other observable inputs.
Foreign Currency Derivative Contracts
Our foreign currency derivative contracts have maturities of
18
months or less and all are with counterparties that have a minimum credit rating of A- or equivalent by S&P Global Ratings, Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. or Fitch Ratings, Inc. We estimate the fair values of these contracts by utilizing an income-based industry standard valuation model for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly. These inputs include foreign currency exchange rates, Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) and swap rates. These inputs, where applicable, are observable at commonly quoted intervals.
Level 3 Inputs
Contingent Consideration Liability
In connection with our first quarter 2021 acquisition of MYR GmbH (“MYR”), we are subject to a potential contingent consideration payment of up to €
300
million, subject to customary adjustments, which is revalued each reporting period using probability-weighted scenarios for U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) approval of Hepcludex until the related contingency is resolved.
The following table summarizes the change in fair value of our contingent consideration liability:
