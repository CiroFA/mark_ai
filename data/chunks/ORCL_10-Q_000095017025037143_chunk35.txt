Months Fiscal 2025 Compared to First Nine Months Fiscal 2024
:
Provision for income taxes increased during the first nine months of fiscal 2025, relative to the corresponding prior year period, primarily due to an unfavorable jurisdictional mix of earnings of $365 million, the absence of the realization of a one-time tax attribute of $247 million, higher income before provision for income taxes of $133 million and the absence of the revaluation benefit of net deferred tax assets due to a change in tax rate of $105 million, partially offset by an increase in tax benefits related to stock-based compensation of $311 million and the absence of changes in unrecognized tax benefits of $207 million.

Working capital
:
The increase in working capital as of February 28, 2025 in comparison to May 31, 2024 was primarily due to favorable impacts to our net current assets resulting from net income and proceeds from the issuance of senior notes, net of issuance costs, of $13.9 billion (refer to Note 3 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report for additional information) during the first nine months of fiscal 2025, partially offset by $12.1 billion of cash used for capital expenditures, $3.3 billion of cash used to pay dividends to our stockholders, â‚¬750 million and $1.0 billion of long-term senior notes that were reclassified to current liabilities, $450 million of cash used for repurchases of our common stock, $380 million of net cash used for our employee stock programs and $178 million of cash used for purchases, net of sales and maturities of non-current investments during the first nine months of fiscal 2025. Our working capital may be impacted by some or all of the aforementioned factors in future periods, the amounts and timing of which are variable.

:
Cash and cash equivalents primarily consist of deposits held at major banks, money market funds and other securities with original maturities of 90 days or less. Marketable securities consist primarily of time deposits with original maturities at the time of purchase greater than 90 days. The increase in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of February 28, 2025 in comparison to May 31, 2024 was primarily due to cash inflows from our operations and proceeds from the issuance of senior notes, net of issuance costs, of $13.9 billion during the first nine months of fiscal 2025. This increase was partially offset by $12.1 billion of cash used for capital expenditures, $4.5 billion of cash used for scheduled repayments of borrowings and commercial paper notes, $3.3 billion of cash used to pay dividends to our stockholders, $450 million of cash used for repurchases of our common stock, $380 million of net cash used for our employee stock programs and $169 million of cash used for purchases, net of sales and maturities of non-marketable
