RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE LOANS.
Our residential mortgage loan portfolio is composed of 1–4 family first and junior lien mortgage loans. Junior lien mortgage loans consist of residential mortgage lines of credit and loans that are subordinate in rights to an existing lien on the same property. Residential mortgage – first lien loans represented 96% of the total residential mortgage loan portfolio at both March 31, 2025, and December 31, 2024.
The residential mortgage loan portfolio includes loans with adjustable-rate features. We monitor the risk of default as a result of interest rate increases on adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) loans, which may be mitigated by product features that limit the amount of the increase in the contractual interest rate. The default risk of these loans is considered in our ACL for loans. ARM loans were $66.6 billion, or 7% of total loans, at March 31, 2025, compared with $66.3 billion, or 7% of total loans, at December 31, 2024, with an initial reset date in 2027 or later for the majority of this portfolio at March 31, 2025. We do not offer option ARM products, nor do we offer variable-rate mortgage products with fixed payment amounts, commonly referred to within the financial services industry as negative amortizing mortgage loans.
The outstanding balance of residential mortgage lines of credit (both first and junior lien) was $11.8 billion at March 31, 2025, compared with $12.4 billion at December 31, 2024. The unfunded credit commitments for these lines of credit totaled $21.0 billion at March 31, 2025, compared with $22.5 billion at December 31, 2024. For additional information on our residential
mortgage loan portfolio, see the “Risk Management – Credit Risk Management – Residential Mortgage Loans” section in our 2024 Form 10-K.
We monitor changes in real estate values and underlying economic or market conditions for the geographic areas of our
residential mortgage loan portfolio as part of our credit risk management process. Our periodic review of this portfolio includes original appraisals adjusted for the change in Home Price Index (HPI) or estimates from automated valuation models (AVMs) to support property values. For additional information about our use of appraisals and AVMs, see Note 5 (Loans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses) to Financial Statements in this Report and the “Risk Management – Credit Risk Management – Residential Mortgage Loans” section in our 2024 Form 10-K.
Part of our credit monitoring includes tracking delinquency, current Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) credit scores and loan to collateral values (LTV) on the entire residential mortgage loan portfolio. For junior lien mortgages, LTV uses the total combined loan balance of first and junior lien mortgages
