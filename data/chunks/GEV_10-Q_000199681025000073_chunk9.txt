INCOME TAXES
.
The Company’s income tax provision through March 31, 2024 was prepared based on a separate return
basis. Following the Spin-off, the Company's income tax provision is prepared on a stand-alone basis.
We recorded income tax expense on pre-tax income with an effective tax rate of
20.5
%
for the
three months ended
March 31, 2025
. The
effective tax rate was lower than the U.S. statutory rate of
21%
primarily due to an income tax benefit from stock-based compensation,
mostly offset by losses providing no tax benefit in
certain
jurisdictions.
We recorded an income tax expense on a pre-tax loss in the
three months ended
March 31, 2024
due to taxes in profitable jurisdictions
and losses providing no tax benefit in other jurisdictions.
The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development has proposed a global minimum tax of
15%
of reported profits (Pillar Two)
and many countries have incorporated Pillar Two model rule concepts into their domestic laws. Although the model rules provide a
framework for applying the minimum tax, countries may enact Pillar Two slightly differently than the model rules and on different timelines
and may adjust domestic tax incentives in response to Pillar Two.
