In August 2018, the Company entered into the 2018 Credit Agreement. The 2018 Credit Agreement, as last amended in March 2024, provided for a $
1.5
billion term loan maturing in October 2028, a $
2.1
billion term loan maturing in August 2030, and a $
610.0
million secured revolving credit facility. Under the 2018 Credit Agreement, the Company may voluntarily prepay outstanding loans at any time, subject to notice, minimum amount requirements, and customary breakage costs, and may be required to prepay outstanding loans under certain circumstances. Prepaid amounts under the revolving credit facility may be re-borrowed.

0.50

1.00
%, plus an applicable margin; or (2) the Term SOFR rate for a specified period, subject to a
0.50
% floor in the case of the term loans and a
0
% floor in the case of the revolving credit facility, plus an applicable margin. The applicable margin with respect to the term loans was

1.00
