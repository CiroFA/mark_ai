Interest Rate Risk
Short-Term Investments and Fixed Income Securities
At November 29, 2024, we had debt securities classified as short-term investments of $273 million. Changes in interest rates could adversely affect the market value of these investments. A sensitivity analysis was performed on our short-term investment portfolio as of November 29, 2024, based on an estimate of the hypothetical changes in market value of the portfolio that would result from an immediate parallel shift in the yield curve. A 150 basis point increase in interest rates would lead to a $1 million decrease in the market value of our short-term investments. Conversely, a 150 basis point decrease in interest rates would lead to a $1 million increase in the market value of our short-term investments.
Senior Notes
As of November 29, 2024, we had $5.65 billion of senior notes outstanding which bear interest at fixed rates, and therefore do not subject us to financial statement risk associated with changes in interest rates. As of November 29, 2024, the total carrying amount of our senior notes was $5.63 billion and the related fair value based on observable market prices in less active markets was $5.51 billion.
See Note 17 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding our senior notes.
