cybersecurity risk management and strategy and governance.
Our or our business partners’ failure or inability to adhere to privacy, data, artificial intelligence and information security laws could result in business disruption, loss of reputation and consumer trust, litigation, regulatory action including significant fines or penalties, financial impact, and loss of revenue, assets or personal, confidential, or sensitive data.
An actual or alleged failure to comply with complex and changing privacy, data, artificial intelligence and information security laws and regulations under the EU General Data Protection Regulation, various U.S. state and federal laws, and other similar privacy and information security laws across the jurisdictions in which PMI operates, such as the failure to protect personal data; implement appropriate technological and reasonable security measures; implement and maintain appropriate safeguards for personal data being transferred internationally; respect the privacy rights of data subjects; provide sufficient detailed notices of personal data processing; retrieve consent and provide opt-outs; meet stringent timeframe requirements for incident reporting to regulatory authorities; comply with artificial intelligence regulations, and others, could have a material adverse effect on us, subject us to substantial fines and/or legal challenges, and/or harm our business, reputation, financial condition, or operating results. Such laws and regulations across the jurisdictions in which PMI operates may vary, resulting in inconsistent or conflicting legal obligations. Although we maintain a cyber liability insurance policy to address many of these risks, such policy may not be sufficient to prevent a cybersecurity incident or attack from resulting in a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition, or operating results.
Risks Related to Acquisitions and Divestitures
We may not successfully identify, complete, or realize the benefits from strategic acquisitions, divestitures, joint ventures, or investments.
From time to time, we evaluate acquisition candidates, joint ventures, or investments that may strategically fit our business objectives. As a result of some of these evaluations, we have acquired and may acquire in the future certain businesses (or parts of businesses) or assets. We have also divested and may divest businesses from time to time. These activities may present financial, managerial, and operational risks including, but not limited to, diversion of management’s attention from existing core businesses; difficulties in integrating, or inability to successfully integrate, acquired businesses, including integrating or separating personnel, information technology, financial and other systems; inability to effectively and immediately implement control environment processes across a diverse employee population; adverse effects on existing or acquired customer and supplier business relationships;
