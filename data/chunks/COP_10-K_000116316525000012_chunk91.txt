tax, emission trading scheme or GHG reduction policies could significantly increase our costs, reduce demand for fossil energy derived products, impact the cost and availability of capital and increase our exposure to litigation. Such laws and regulations could also increase demand for less carbon intensive energy sources, including natural gas. The ultimate impact on our financial performance, either positive or negative, will depend on a number of factors, including but not limited to:
•
Whether and to what extent legislation or regulation is enacted;
•
The timing of the introduction of such legislation or regulation;
•
The nature of the legislation (such as a cap and trade system or a tax on emissions) or regulation;
•
The price placed on GHG emissions (either by the market or through a tax);
•
The GHG emissions reductions required;
•
The price and availability of offsets;
•
The amount and allocation of allowances;
•
Technological and scientific developments leading to new products or services;
•
Any potential significant physical effects of climate change (such as increased severe weather events, changes in sea levels and changes in temperature); and
•
Whether, and the extent to which, increased compliance costs are ultimately reflected in the prices of our products and services.
See Item 1A. Risk Factors—Existing and future laws, regulations and internal initiatives relating to global climate changes, such as limitations on GHG emissions may impact or limit our business plans, result in significant expenditures, promote alternative uses of energy or reduce demand for our products

Company Response to Climate-Related Risks
The objective of our Climate Risk Strategy is to manage climate-related risk, optimize opportunities and equip the company to respond to changes in key uncertainties, including government policies around the world, technologies for emissions reduction, alternative energy technologies and changes in consumer trends. The strategy sets out our choices around portfolio composition, emissions reductions, targets and incentives, emissions-related technology development, and our climate-related policy and finance sector engagement.
Our Climate Risk Strategy is intended to enable us to responsibly meet the global demand for energy, deliver competitive returns on and of capital and work to meet our previously established emissions-reduction targets. First, meeting global energy demand requires a focus on delivering production that will best compete in any energy mix scenario. This production will be delivered from resources with a competitive cost of supply and low GHG intensity, as well as portfolio diversity by market and asset type. Next, in delivering competitive returns, ConocoPhillips has been a leader in shifting the exploration and production sector’s value proposition away from one focused on production toward one focused on returns. Finally, to drive accountability
