revenues and financial expenses, operating expenses, other income (expenses), income tax expense, net income and shareholders' equity for a positive and a negative 10% fluctuation on all the foreign currencies to which we are exposed to at the moment of translating our financial statements to U.S. dollars for the year ended December 31, 2024:
(1)
Increase of the subsidiaries local currency against U.S. Dollar.
(2)
Decrease of the subsidiaries local currency against U.S. Dollar.
(3)
Includes cost of net revenues and financial expenses and operating expenses.
The table above shows an increase in our net income when the U.S. dollar weakens against foreign currencies because of the positive impact of the increase in income from operations. On the other hand, the table above shows a decrease in our net income when the U.S. dollar strengthens against foreign currencies because of the negative impact of the decrease in income from operations.
Brazilian segment
Considering a hypothetical decrease of 10% of the Brazilian Real against the U.S. dollar on December 31, 2024, the reported net assets in our Brazilian subsidiaries would have decreased by approximately $286 million with the related impact in Other Comprehensive Income. Additionally, we would have recorded a foreign currency loss amounting to approximately $51 million in our Brazilian subsidiaries.
Mexican segment
Considering a hypothetical decrease of 10% of the Mexican peso against the U.S. dollar on December 31, 2024, the reported net assets in our Mexican subsidiaries would have decreased by approximately $142 million with the related impact in Other Comprehensive Income. Additionally, we would have recorded a foreign currency loss amounting to approximately $10 million in our Mexican subsidiaries.
Argentine segment
In accordance with U.S. GAAP, we have classified our Argentine operations as highly inflationary since July 1, 2018, using the U.S. dollar as the functional currency for purposes of reporting our financial statements. Therefore, no translation effect has been accounted for in other comprehensive income related to our Argentine operations since July 1, 2018. Argentina’s annual inflation rate for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 was 117.8%, 211.4% and 94.8%, respectively.
We use Argentina’s official exchange rate to account for transactions in our Argentine segment, which as of December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 was 1,032.00, 808.45 and 177.16, respectively, against the U.S. dollar. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, Argentina’s official exchange rate against the U.S. dollar increased 27.7%, 356.3% and 72.5%, respectively.
Considering a hypothetical decrease of 10% of the Argentine Peso against the U.S. dollar on December 31, 2024, the effect on non-functional currency net asset position in our Argentine subsidiaries would have been a foreign exchange loss amounting to approximately $72 million in our Argentine subsidiaries.
