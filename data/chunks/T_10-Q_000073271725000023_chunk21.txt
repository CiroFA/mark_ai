Dollars in millions except per share amounts
The following table presents the previously transferred equipment installment receivables, which we repurchased in exchange for the associated beneficial interests:
At March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, our beneficial interests were $
2,083
and $
3,185
, respectively, of which $
1,189
and $
1,906
are included in “Prepaid and other current assets” on our consolidated balance sheets, with the remainder in “Other Assets.” The guarantee obligation at March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024 was $
295
and $
301
, respectively, of which $
162
and $
150
are included in “Accounts payable and accrued liabilities” on our consolidated balance sheets, with the remainder in “Other noncurrent liabilities.” Our maximum exposure to loss as a result of selling these equipment installment receivables is limited to the total amount of our beneficial interests and guarantee obligation.
Revolving Receivables Program
During 2025, we expanded our revolving agreement to transfer up to $
2,940
of certain receivables through our bankruptcy-remote subsidiaries to various financial institutions on a recurring basis in exchange for cash equal to the gross receivables transferred. This agreement is subject to renewal on an annual basis and the transfer limit may be expanded or reduced from time to time. As customers pay their balances, we transfer additional receivables into the program, resulting in our gross receivables sold exceeding net cash flow impacts (e.g., collect and reinvest). The transferred receivables are fully guaranteed by our bankruptcy-remote subsidiaries, which hold additional receivables in the amount of $
244
that are pledged as collateral under this agreement. The transfers are recorded at fair value of the proceeds received and obligations assumed less derecognized receivables. Our maximum exposure to loss related to these receivables transferred is limited to the derecognized amount outstanding.
The following table sets forth a summary of the revolving receivables sold:
