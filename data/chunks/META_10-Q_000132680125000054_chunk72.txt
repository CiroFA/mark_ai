past and will fluctuate in the future. Additionally, we have a limited operating history with the current scale of our business, which makes it difficult to forecast our future results. As a result, you should not rely upon our past quarterly financial results as indicators of future performance. You should take into account the risks and uncertainties frequently encountered by companies in rapidly evolving markets. Our financial results in any given quarter can be influenced by numerous factors, many of which we are unable to predict or are outside of our control, including:
•
our ability to maintain and grow our user base and user engagement, particularly for our products that deliver ad impressions;
•
our ability to attract and retain marketers in a particular period;
•
our ability to recognize revenue or collect payments from marketers or advertising agencies or resellers in a particular period;
•
fluctuations in spending by our marketers due to seasonality, such as historically strong spending in the fourth quarter of each year, episodic regional or global events, or other factors;
•
the frequency, prominence, size, format, and quality of ads shown to users;
