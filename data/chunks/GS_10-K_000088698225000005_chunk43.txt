the Australian Privacy Act 1988, and Indiaâ€™s Digital Personal Data Protection Act. Generally, privacy laws impose obligations with regard to the collection, use and disclosure of personal information and require public disclosure of privacy practices.

In 2023, the SEC proposed to amend Regulation Systems Compliance and Integrity (SCI). The proposed amendments to Regulation SCI would, among other things, expand the types of entities covered by the regulation, require additional policies and procedures to address cybersecurity risks, and require disclosure of additional types of cybersecurity events to the SEC.
In 2024, the SEC amended Regulation S-P that implements the GLB Act. The amendments to Regulation S-P require broker-dealers, investment companies and investment advisers registered with the SEC to adopt written policies and procedures for incident response programs to address unauthorized access to or use of customer information. The amended Regulation S-P requires covered entities to notify within 30 days individuals affected by an incident involving sensitive customer information and provide them with details about the incident and other information intended to help affected individuals respond appropriately. Larger covered entities, such as GS&Co., will have until December 2025, and smaller covered entities will have until June 2026, to comply with the amended Regulation S-P.
