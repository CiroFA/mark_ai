monetary relief, incurred other
penalties and experienced other repercussions in connection with resolving investigations and enforcement actions by governmental agencies. JPMorganChase could become subject to similar regulatory or governmental resolutions or other actions in the future, and addressing the requirements of any such resolutions or actions could result in JPMorganChase incurring higher operational and compliance costs, including devoting substantial resources to the required remediation or needing to comply with other restrictions.
In connection with resolving specific regulatory investigations or enforcement actions, certain regulators have required JPMorganChase and other financial institutions to admit wrongdoing with respect to the activities that gave rise to the resolution. These types of admissions can lead to:
•
greater exposure in litigation
•
damage to JPMorganChase’s reputation
•
disqualification from doing business with certain clients or customers, or in specific jurisdictions, or
•
other direct and indirect adverse effects.
Furthermore, government officials in the U.S. and other countries have demonstrated a willingness to bring criminal actions against financial institutions and have required that institutions plead guilty to criminal offenses or admit other wrongdoing in connection with resolving regulatory investigations or enforcement actions. Resolutions of this type can have significant collateral consequences for the subject financial institution, including:
•
loss of clients, customers and business
•
restrictions on offering certain products or services, and
•
losing permission to operate certain businesses, either temporarily or permanently.
JPMorganChase expects that:
•
it and other financial services firms will continue to be subject to heightened regulatory scrutiny and governmental investigations and enforcement actions
•
governmental authorities will continue to require that financial institutions be penalized for actual or deemed violations of law with formal and punitive enforcement actions, including the imposition of significant monetary and other sanctions, rather than resolving these matters through informal supervisory actions, and
•
governmental authorities will be more likely to pursue formal enforcement actions and resolutions against JPMorganChase to the extent that it has previously been subject to other governmental investigations or enforcement actions.
If JPMorganChase fails to meet the requirements of any resolution of a governmental investigation or enforcement action, or to maintain risk and control processes that meet the heightened standards and expectations of its regulators, it could be required to, among other things:
•
enter into further resolutions of investigations or enforcement actions
•
pay additional regulatory penalties or enter into judgments, or
•
accept material regulatory restrictions on, or changes in the management of, its businesses.
In these circumstances,
