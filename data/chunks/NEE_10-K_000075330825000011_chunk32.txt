agreements for new facilities with third parties could have similar consequences.
The operation and maintenance of NEE's and FPL's electric generation, storage, transmission and distribution facilities, natural gas and oil production and transportation facilities and other facilities are subject to many operational risks, the consequences of which could have a material adverse effect on NEE's and FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
NEE's and FPL's electric generation, storage, transmission and distribution facilities, natural gas and oil production and transportation facilities and other facilities are subject to many operational risks. Operational risks could result in, among other things, lost revenues due to prolonged outages, increased expenses due to monetary penalties or fines for compliance failures or legal claims, liability to third parties for property and personal injury damage or loss of life, unsatisfied customers, a failure to perform under applicable power sales agreements or other agreements and associated loss of revenues from terminated agreements or liability for liquidated damages under continuing agreements, and replacement equipment costs or an obligation to purchase or generate replacement power at higher prices.
Uncertainties and risks inherent in operating and maintaining NEE's and FPL's facilities include, but are not limited to:
•
risks associated with facility start-up operations, such as whether the facility will achieve projected operating performance on schedule and otherwise as planned;
•
failures in the availability, acquisition or transportation of fuel or other necessary supplies;
•
the impact of unusual or adverse weather conditions and natural disasters, including, but not limited to, hurricanes, tornadoes, extreme temperatures, icing events, wildfires, floods, severe convective storms, earthquakes and droughts;
•
performance below expected or contracted levels of output or efficiency;
•
breakdown or failure, including, but not limited to, explosions, fires, leaks or other major events, of equipment, transmission or distribution systems or pipelines;
•
availability of replacement equipment;
•
risks of property damage, human injury or loss of life from energized equipment, hazardous substances or explosions, fires, leaks or other events, especially where facilities are located near populated areas;
•
potential environmental impacts of natural gas and oil production and transportation operations;
•
risks associated with potential harm to wildlife;
•
availability of adequate water resources and ability to satisfy water intake and discharge requirements;
•
inability to identify, manage properly or mitigate equipment defects in NEE's and FPL's facilities;
•
use of new or unproven technology;
•
inability to anticipate or adapt to changes in the reliability of NEE's or FPL's equipment, operating systems or facilities;
•
risks associated with dependence on a specific type of fuel
