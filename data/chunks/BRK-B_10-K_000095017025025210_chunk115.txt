other energy businesses increased $310 million in 2024 compared to 2023. The increase was primarily due to higher earnings at Northern Powergrid, partially offset by lower earnings from the renewable energy business. The increase at Northern Powergrid was attributable to higher distribution revenue due to higher tariffs from inflation adjustments and lower income tax expense attributable to charges recognized in 2023 for the U.K. Energy Profits Levy and a group relief tax benefit recognized in 2024, partially offset by unfavorable results from the upstream gas exploration and production business and higher operating expenses. Earnings from the renewable energy business decreased mainly due to lower earnings from wind tax equity investments in 2024 and debt extinguishment gains recognized in 2023.
Net earnings of real estate brokerage decreased $120 million 2024 compared to 2023, primarily attributable to charges in connection with the ongoing real estate industry litigation matters. In April 2024, HomeServices agreed to terms with the plaintiffs to settle all claims asserted against HomeServices and certain of its subsidiaries and effectuate a nationwide class settlement. See Note 27 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. The real estate brokerage business continues to be negatively impacted by the availability of homes for sale and high home prices.
Corporate interest and other after-tax earnings include BHE corporate interest expense and unallocated corporate and income tax expenses. Noncontrolling interests and preferred stock dividends include earnings attributable to non-Berkshire owners of BHE common stock and dividends on preferred stock held by other Berkshire subsidiaries. All remaining noncontrolling interests in BHE common stock were acquired in 2024 and the preferred stock is expected to be redeemed in 2025.
2023 versus 2022
Net earnings of the U.S. utilities declined $1.4 billion in 2023 compared to 2022. The decline reflected an increase in energy operating expenses, including an increase in pre-tax loss accruals, net of expected insurance recoveries, of $1.6 billion for the Wildfires. The decline in earnings also reflected higher interest expense and lower electric utility margin. These items were partially offset by increases in other income and lower depreciation and amortization expense.
The U.S. utilities’ electric utility margin was $7.5 billion in 2023, a decrease of $170 million (2.2%) versus 2022. The decline reflected lower volumes and wholesale rates, as well as increased energy costs, partially offset by an increase in retail customer rates in certain territories. Retail customer volumes decreased 0.8% overall (down 0.8% at PacifiCorp and 2.6% at NV Energy and up 1.3% at MEC) in 2023 compared to 2022, primarily due to an overall unfavorable impact of weather, partially offset by increases in customer usage and the average number of customers.
