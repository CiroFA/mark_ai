cash, and if they exercise their option to convert, the note holders are entitled to cash payment for the conversion premium, settled at maturity. Based on the closing sales prices of the Company's common stock for the prescribed measurement periods, the May 2025 Notes were convertible at the option of the holder starting the second calendar quarter of 2023 until November 1, 2024, when they became convertible regardless of the Company's stock price. The May 2025 Notes are classified as "Short-term debt" in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2024 and 2023. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the estimated fair value of the May 2025 Notes was $
2.1
billion and $
1.6
billion, respectively, and was considered a "Level 2" fair value measurement (see Note 2). For the years ended December 31, 2023, and 2022, the weighted-average effective interest rate related to the May 2025 Notes was
1.2
%. During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company paid $
198
million in aggregate upon the conversion of the May 2025 Notes at the holders' option, to repay the principal amount of $
78
million due upon conversion and an additional $
120
million conversion premium.
Upon issuance and subsequent balance sheet-date reassessments through September 30, 2024, the conversion option on the May 2025 Notes qualified for the equity scope exception under ASC 815 Derivatives and Hedging ("ASC 815") because the Company had the option to deliver either cash or shares of the Company's common stock to satisfy the conversion premium. Under such exception, the conversion option is not required to be accounted for as a separate instrument. On November 1, 2024, the Company irrevocably elected to settle the conversion premium in cash. Upon that election, the conversion option no longer qualified for the exception and was deemed to be an embedded derivative which required bifurcation from the debt contract. Upon bifurcation of the conversion option, the Company recorded an embedded derivative liability at fair value of $
1.2
billion, a debt discount of $
783
million reducing the carrying value of the May 2025 Notes to zero, and a loss of $
428
million. The debt discount is amortized over the remaining term of the May 2025 Notes using the straight-line method. The fair value of the embedded derivative liability (considered a "Level 2" fair value measurement; see Note 2), was $
1.3
billion at December 31, 2024 and is included in "Accrued expenses and other current liabilities" in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The unamortized debt discount and debt issuance costs was $
523
million at December 31, 2024.
