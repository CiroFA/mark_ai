disease caused by certain serotypes, rose 22% in 2024 primarily due to continued uptake following launches in the pediatric indication in Europe, Japan, and other countries in the Asia Pacific region, partially offset by lower demand in the U.S. due to competition. Merck is a party to license agreements pursuant to which the Company pays royalties on sales of

Worldwide sales of
Pneumovax
23, a vaccine to help prevent pneumococcal disease, declined 36% in 2024 due to lower global demand, particularly in the U.S. as the market has shifted toward newer adult pneumococcal conjugate vaccines.
In June 2024, the FDA approved
Capvaxive
(Pneumococcal 21-valent Conjugate Vaccine) for the prevention of invasive pneumococcal disease and pneumococcal pneumonia caused by certain serotypes in individuals 18 years of age and older. The approval was supported by results from multiple Phase 3 clinical studies evaluating
Capvaxive
in both vaccine-naïve and vaccine-experienced adult patient populations, including STRIDE-3, STRIDE-4, STRIDE-5 and STRIDE-6. Sales of
Capvaxive
were $97 million in 2024. Merck is a party to license agreements pursuant to which the Company pays royalties on sales of
Capvaxive
. Under the most significant of these agreements, Merck pays a royalty of 7.25% on net sales of

Global sales of
Bridion
, for the reversal of two types of neuromuscular blocking agents used during surgery, declined 4% in 2024 primarily driven by lower demand in certain international markets due to generic competition, particularly in the EU and the Asia Pacific region, including in Japan. The
Bridion
sales decline was partially offset by higher demand and pricing in the U.S. The patents that provided market exclusivity for
Bridion
in the EU and Japan expired in July 2023 and January 2024, respectively. Accordingly, the Company is experiencing sales declines of
Bridion
in these markets and expects the declines to continue.
Worldwide sales of
Prevymis
, a medicine for prophylaxis (prevention) of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection and disease in certain high risk adult and pediatric recipients of an allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplant and for prophylaxis of CMV disease in certain high risk adult and pediatric recipients of a kidney transplant, grew 30% in 2024 largely due to higher global demand, particularly in the U.S.
