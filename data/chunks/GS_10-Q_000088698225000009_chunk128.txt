market-making conditions remain constant, increases in client activity levels or bid/offer spreads tend to result in increases in net revenues, and decreases tend to have the opposite effect. However, changes in market-making conditions can materially impact client activity levels and bid/offer spreads, as well as the fair value of our inventory. For example, a decrease in liquidity in the market could have the impact of (i) increasing our bid/offer spread, (ii) decreasing investor confidence and thereby decreasing client activity levels, and (iii) widening of credit spreads on our inventory positions.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis
The table below presents our FICC and Equities net revenues by line item in the consolidated statements of earnings.
In the table above:
•
See “Net Revenues” for information about market making revenues, commissions and fees, other principal transactions revenues and net interest income. See Note 25 to the consolidated financial statements for net interest income by segment.
•
The primary driver of net revenues for FICC intermediation for all periods was client activity.
•
The increase in net interest income across FICC and Equities for the first quarter of 2025 compared with the first quarter of 2024 reflected higher-yielding assets and a decrease in funding costs. Due to the nature of activities within FICC and Equities and the composition of their associated balance sheet, we assess the performance of these businesses based on total net revenues, as offsets can occur across revenue line items. For example, cash instruments that generate interest income are, in some cases, hedged or funded by derivatives for which changes in fair value are reflected in market making revenues. Also, certain activities produce market making revenues but incur interest expense related to the funding of the related inventory.
