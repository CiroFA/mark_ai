Principles of Consolidation
–
The consolidated financial statements were prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP") and include the accounts of all significant subsidiaries where control exists and, in limited situations, variable-interest entities where the company is the primary beneficiary. Intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated in consolidation and any significant related-party transactions have been disclosed.
Equity investments generally consist of 20% to 50% owned operations where the company exercises significant influence, but does not have control. Income from equity investments in corporations is reported on an after-tax basis. Pre-tax income from equity investments that are partnerships or limited-liability corporations is included in other income (expenses) – net with related taxes included in Income taxes. Equity investments are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances reflect that an impairment loss may have been incurred.
