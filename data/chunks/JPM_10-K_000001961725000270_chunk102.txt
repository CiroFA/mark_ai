Reserve or the FDIC is obligated to follow JPMorganChase’s preferred resolution strategy, and losses to unsecured creditors of the Parent Company, including holders of eligible LTD, and to holders of equity securities of the Parent Company, under whatever strategy is ultimately followed, could be greater than they might have been under JPMorganChase’s preferred strategy.
Political
Economic uncertainty or instability caused by political and geopolitical developments can negatively impact JPMorganChase’s businesses.
Political developments in the U.S. and other countries can cause uncertainty in the economic environment and market conditions in which JPMorganChase operates its businesses. Certain governmental policy initiatives, as well as heightened geopolitical tensions,
could significantly affect U.S. and global economic growth and cause higher volatility in the financial markets, including:
•
monetary policies and actions taken by the Federal Reserve and other central banks or governmental authorities, including changes in interest rate levels and any sustained large-scale asset purchases or any suspension or reversal of those actions
•
fiscal policies, including with respect to taxation and spending
•
isolationist foreign policies
•
economic or financial sanctions
•
the implementation of tariffs and other protectionist trade policies
•
changes to immigration policies, or
•
actions that the government takes or fails to take in response to the effects of health emergencies, the spread of infectious diseases, epidemics or pandemics.
These types of political developments, and uncertainty about the possible outcomes of these developments, could:
•
erode investor or consumer confidence in the U.S. economy and financial markets, which could potentially undermine the status of the U.S. dollar as a safe haven currency
•
provoke retaliatory countermeasures by other countries and otherwise heighten tensions in regulatory, enforcement or diplomatic relations
•
increase the risk of targeted cyber attacks
•
increase concerns about whether the U.S. government will be funded, and its outstanding debt serviced, at any particular time
•
result in periodic shutdowns of the U.S. government
•
influence investor perceptions concerning government support of certain sectors of the economy or the economy as a whole
•
influence monetary policy actions of the Federal Reserve to moderate the economic impact of political developments, including decisions on interest rate levels and asset purchases and sales
•
adversely affect the financial condition or credit ratings of clients and counterparties with which JPMorganChase does business, or
•
cause JPMorganChase to refrain from engaging in business opportunities that it might otherwise pursue.
These factors could lead to:
•
slower growth rates, rising inflation or recession
•
disruptions in labor markets
•
greater market volatility
