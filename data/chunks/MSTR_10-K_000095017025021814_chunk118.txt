proceeds from the sale of class A common stock under our at-the-market equity offering programs, net proceeds from the issuances of our 2030 Convertible Notes, 2031 Convertible Notes, 2032 Convertible Notes, 2028 Convertible Notes, and 2029 Convertible Notes, and Excess Cash.

Net cash provided by financing activities.
In 2024 and 2023, the changes in cash provided by and used in financing activities primarily relate to the issuance and subsequent repayment of our long-term debt, the sale of class A common stock under our at-the-market equity offering programs, the exercise or vesting of certain awards under the Stock Incentive Plans, and the sales of class A common stock under the 2021 ESPP. Net cash provided by financing activities increased $20.243 billion during 2024, as compared to the prior year, primarily due to (i) a $14.310 billion increase in net proceeds from the sale of class A common stock under our at-the-market equity offering programs during 2024 as compared to 2023, (ii) a $6.133 billion increase in long-term debt proceeds, net of issuance costs during 2024 as compared to 2023, (iii) the $160.0 million repayment of the 2025 Secured Term Loan and related third-party extinguishment costs during 2023, which was repaid using proceeds from our sale of class A common stock offered under our at-the-market equity offering programs, and (iv) a $153.8 million increase in proceeds from the exercise of stock options under the Stock Incentive Plans during 2024 as compared to 2023, partially offset by (v) the $515.4 million repayment of the 2028 Secured Notes and related third-party extinguishment costs during 2024, which was repaid using proceeds from the issuance of the 2028 Convertible Notes.
