Compensation
The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of
17,500,000
shares (
10,000,000
RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate of
27,800,000
shares (
15,885,000
RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes.
As required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, in conjunction with the 2024 special dividend, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was increased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of
1.018
, representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of $
674.62
on December 26, 2023, which was the last trading day immediately prior to the ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of $
662.70
on the ex-dividend date, December 27, 2023. The outstanding RSUs increased by approximately
52,000
. The adjustment did not result in additional stock-based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not change. As further required by the 2019 Incentive Plan, the maximum number of shares issuable under the plan was proportionally adjusted, which resulted in an additional
128,000
RSU shares available to be granted.
