remained unresolved at the time of filing.  On January 24, 2025, RBH filed an objection to approval of the Proposed Plan with the CCAA court (for further details, see Item 8, Note 18.
Contingencies
). Developments, including the positions taken by RBH in this objection and the positions taken by other parties in related filings narrowed the range of possible outcomes with respect to the allocation of the aggregate settlement amount of CAD 32.5 billion among RBH, ITL, and JTIM, which was determined to be an indicator that PMI’s investment in RBH may be impaired. Although there remains some uncertainty as to the final terms of the Proposed plan, PMI evaluated its investment in RBH for potential impairment and concluded that the estimated fair value of its investment in RBH was lower than its carrying value.  As a result, PMI performed a quantitative valuation of its investment in RBH as of December 31, 2024, and recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $2,316 million (representing a diluted EPS charge of $1.49 per share) in the consolidated statement of earnings for the year ended December 31, 2024, as a recognized subsequent event.  For further details, see Item 8, Note 6.

Net Revenues –
Net revenues of $37.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2024, increased by $2.7 billion, or 7.7%, from the comparable 2023 amount.  The change in our net revenues from the comparable 2023 amount was driven by the following (variances not to scale):
Net revenues increased by 7.7%. Net revenues, excluding currency and acquisitions, increased by 10.1%, mainly reflecting: a favorable pricing variance, primarily driven by higher combustible tobacco pricing; and favorable volume/mix, driven by higher smoke-free products volume, partly offset by unfavorable cigarette mix, as well as a favorable comparison to 2023 reflecting a charge in the first quarter of 2023 of $80 million following the termination of a distribution arrangement in the Middle East, shown in "Other." The termination of a distribution arrangement in the Middle East is further described in the following "
