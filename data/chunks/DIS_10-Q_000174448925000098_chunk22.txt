Company’s operations are reported in
three
segments: Entertainment, Sports and Experiences, for which separate financial information is evaluated regularly by the Chief Executive Officer to allocate resources and assess performance.
Segment operating results reflect earnings before corporate and unallocated shared expenses, restructuring and impairment charges, net other income/expense, net interest expense, income taxes and noncontrolling interests. Segment operating income generally includes equity in the income of investees and excludes amortization of intangible assets and the fair value step-up for film and television costs recognized in connection with the acquisition of TFCF Corporation (TFCF) and Hulu in fiscal 2019 (TFCF and Hulu Acquisition Amortization). Corporate and unallocated shared expenses principally consist of corporate functions, executive management and certain unallocated administrative support functions.
Segment operating results include allocations of certain costs, including information technology, pension, legal and other shared services costs, which are allocated based on metrics designed to correlate with consumption.
