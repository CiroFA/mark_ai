Cash Flows Provided By Operating Activities
Our primary source of funds continues to be cash generated from operations. Net cash provided by operating activities increased $698 million during the three months ended March 31, 2025 compared to the similar period in 2024 primarily due to an increase in earnings and discretionary pension plan contributions of $365 million made during the three months ended March 31, 2024 that did not reoccur. As a result of the prior year discretionary contributions to our qualified pension plans and the additional non-cash contribution made in April 2025 in the principal amount of $563 million, we expect that there will be no required pension funding through the end of 2025, subject to changes in market conditions.

During the three months ended March 31, 2025, net cash used in financing activities was $5.9 billion. During the three months ended March 31, 2024, net cash used in financing activities was $1.4 billion.
During the three months ended March 31, 2025, our net cash used in financing activities was primarily driven by cash dividends paid of $2.9 billion, repayments of asset-backed long-term borrowings of $2.6 billion and repayments and repurchases of long-term borrowings and finance lease obligations of $2.4 billion. These payments were partially offset by proceeds from asset-backed long-term
