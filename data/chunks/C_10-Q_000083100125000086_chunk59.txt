institutions and the public sector. Citi employs approximately 220 people in Ukraine and their safety is Citi’s top priority. All of Citi’s domestic operations in Ukraine are conducted through a subsidiary of Citibank, which uses the Ukrainian hryvnia as its functional currency. As of March 31, 2025, Citi had $1.6 billion of direct exposures related to Ukraine (a decrease of $0.1 billion from December 31, 2024).

businesses. As of March 31, 2025, Citi’s net investment in its Argentine operations was approximately $1.6 billion (compared to $1.5 billion at December 31, 2024). Citi uses Argentina’s official market exchange rate to remeasure its net Argentine peso (ARS)–denominated assets into U.S. dollars (USD), with the impact of exchange rate fluctuations recorded directly in earnings. As of March 31, 2025, the official ARS exchange rate was 1,074, which devalued by 4% against the USD during the first quarter of 2025.
The Central Bank of Argentina (BCRA) has generally maintained certain capital and currency controls that have broadly restricted Citi’s ability to access USD in Argentina and remit earnings from its Argentine operations. On April 11, 2025, the government of Argentina executed an extended funding facility with the International Monetary Fund, pursuant to which the government announced certain measures related to its historical capital and currency controls. Specifically, the government announced that it will allow the official exchange rate to fluctuate between 1,000 and 1,400 ARS per USD, that exchange restrictions are removed for individuals (though are still applicable to local institutions) and that 2025 earnings may be remitted in 2026, through ordinary dividends. Additionally, the BCRA has announced that it will issue a new series of certain USD-denominated bonds (BOPREALs), similar to the prior year, which provides a mechanism to remit dividends up to a certain amount in 2025 through the purchase and subsequent sale of the bonds and remittance of the bond proceeds.
Nonetheless, the historical and ongoing capital and currency controls have resulted in indirect foreign exchange mechanisms that some Argentine entities may use to obtain USD, often at rates that are significantly higher than Argentina’s official exchange rate. If the official exchange rate converges with the approximate rate implied by the indirect foreign exchange mechanisms, Citi could incur additional translation losses on its net investment in Argentina.
Of the $1.6 billion net investment in Argentina as of March 31, 2025, Citi’s net ARS exposure was approximately $1.1 billion (unchanged from December 31, 2024).
As of March 31, 2025, Citi hedged approximately $0.2 billion of its ARS exposure through offshore hedges, and Citi was unable to hedge its remaining exposure, given illiquidity in the offshore derivatives market.
