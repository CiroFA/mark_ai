million, and
3.5
million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 were excluded from the computation of Diluted loss per share, because the effect would have been antidilutive as a result of incurring a net loss in those periods.

Net deferred tax assets/(liabilities) at December 31 were as follows:
The Company’s deferred income tax assets of $
17,991
can be used in future years to offset taxable income and reduce income taxes payable. The Company’s deferred income tax liabilities of $
10,091
will partially offset deferred income tax assets and result in higher taxable income in future years and increase income taxes payable. Tax law determines whether future reversals of temporary differences will result in taxable and deductible amounts that offset each other in future years. The particular years in which temporary differences result in taxable or deductible amounts generally are determined by the timing of the recovery of the related asset or settlement of the related liability. The deferred income tax assets and liabilities relate primarily to U.S. federal and state tax jurisdictions. From a U.S. federal tax perspective, the Company generated tax net operating losses in 2021 and 2024 and interest carryovers in 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024 that can be carried forward indefinitely and federal research and development credits that can be carried forward 20 years.
Throughout 2023 and 2024, the Company was in a three-year cumulative pre-tax loss position. For purposes of assessing the recoverability of deferred tax assets, the Company determined that it could not include future projected earnings in the analysis due to recent history of losses.
