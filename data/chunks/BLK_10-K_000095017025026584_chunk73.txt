functions, effectively manage growth or realize other intended benefits of its inorganic strategy in the timeframe BlackRock expects, or at all. Moreover, the challenges associated with BlackRock’s inorganic strategy may be heightened when inorganic transactions are in new geographic locations, involve new markets, products, business lines or early stage investments or are delivered via technology and systems that differ from those employed by BlackRock or that overlap with existing BlackRock businesses. In addition, in the case of minority investments and joint ventures, including BlackRock’s joint venture to provide investment solutions in India, BlackRock may be subject to risks due to reputational harm, liability or loss resulting from, or relating to operating systems, risk management controls, and employees that are outside of BlackRock’s control, risks related to the jurisdictions or markets in which such investees or joint ventures operate and risks related to the joint venture partners and investees. Any failure to identify and mitigate the risks associated with acquisitions, joint ventures or minority investments through due diligence, governance or oversight rights, indemnification provisions and/or operational expertise, or to manage the integration of acquisitions effectively, could result in losses or impairments related to such transactions and have an adverse effect on BlackRock’s reputation or cause its AUM, revenue and earnings to decline, which may harm the Company’s competitive position in the investment management industry.
