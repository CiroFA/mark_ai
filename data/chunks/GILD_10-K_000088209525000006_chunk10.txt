We also depend on contract manufacturing organizations (“CMOs”), inside and outside of the U.S., to perform manufacturing activities for the majority of our API and drug products. For most of our products, including our HIV and HCV products, we use multiple CMOs so that we have both primary and back-up suppliers and manufacturing sites. For our future products, we continue to develop additional manufacturing capabilities and establish additional third-party suppliers to manufacture sufficient quantities of our product candidates to undertake clinical trials and to manufacture sufficient quantities of any product that is approved for commercial sale.
For more information, see “Government Regulation” section below and Item 1A. Risk Factors “We may not be able to obtain materials or supplies necessary to conduct clinical trials or to manufacture and sell our products, or we may face manufacturing difficulties, delays or interruptions, including at our third-party manufacturers and corporate partners, which could limit our ability to generate revenues.”
