conduct subsequent inspections to verify the information we submitted.
On January 19, 2024, the FDA completed its review of our Requests for Exemption from Substantial Equivalence (the “EX REQs”) for the five submitted
IQOS
consumables and determined that these tobacco products were exempt from the requirements outlined for substantial equivalence (a regulatory pathway that can be used to introduce new tobacco products which have the same characteristics as a product previously authorized by the FDA). These submissions were made in November 2022 (for the three initial
IQOS
consumables) and February 2023 (for the two new
IQOS
consumables) to enable domestic manufacturing of
IQOS
consumables utilizing materials purchased from vendors operating in the United States.
On April 29, 2024, we submitted the Annual Report for the
IQOS
Tobacco Heating System ("THS") to the FDA. The report included a systematic review of the literature covering publications related to the
IQOS
THS between March 1, 2023, and February 29, 2024. The report included publications in various scientific fields including aerosol chemistry and physics, standard and systems toxicology, clinical studies on exposure reduction to HPHCs, and observational studies. Overall, the review continues to support the finding that
IQOS
THS is "appropriate for the promotion of public health."
FDA Review of Swedish Match Products
: Premarket tobacco applications for 20 varieties of
ZYN
nicotine pouches were submitted in March 2020. In the same month, these applications were filed for scientific review and, in July 2020, the FDA issued a deficiency letter, which Swedish Match USA, Inc. addressed in September 2020. On January 16, 2025, the FDA determined that all 20
ZYN
nicotine pouch varieties currently marketed in the U.S. met the applicable public health standard and were appropriate for the protection of public health and, therefore, authorized them for sale in the United States. In its assessment, the FDA concluded that “among several key considerations, the agency’s evaluation showed that, due to substantially lower amounts of harmful constituents than cigarettes and most smokeless tobacco products, such as moist snuff and snus, the authorized products pose lower risk of cancer and other serious health conditions than such products.” Prior to the authorization, these 20 varieties of
ZYN
pouches were marketed in the United States consistent with the FDA's practice not to take enforcement action to prevent products with respect to which applications were filed prior to a September 9, 2020 deadline from being marketed. After the September 9, 2020 deadline, we also submitted additional applications for authorization to market other
ZYN
products. The FDA has not issued a decision on these applications, and these
ZYN
products are not marketed in the United States. In April 2024, we submitted MRTPAs for
ZYN
products currently marketed in the United States and requested authorization of the modified risk
