Dividend distributions
Under Swiss corporate law, dividends must be stated in Swiss francs though dividend payments are made by Chubb in U.S. dollars. We issue dividends without subjecting them to withholding tax by way of distributions from capital contribution reserves and payment out of free reserves.
The following table presents dividend distributions per Common Share in Swiss francs (CHF) and U.S. dollars (USD):
b) Shares issued, outstanding, authorized, and conditional
Increases in Common Shares in treasury are due to open market repurchases of Common Shares, the surrender of Common Shares to satisfy tax withholding obligations in connection with the vesting of restricted stock, and the forfeiture of unvested restricted stock. Decreases in Common Shares in treasury are principally due to grants of restricted stock, exercises of stock options, purchases under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP), and share cancellations. At our May 2024 annual general meeting, our shareholders approved the cancellation of
11,825,600
shares purchased under our share repurchase programs
