conclusions we draw, the actions we take (including, but not limited to, rating actions, revising the composition of our indices, etc.), and the work our divisions produce are likely to be heavily scrutinized with the benefit of hindsight. We have faced significant regulatory and media scrutiny following prior periods of volatility and economic uncertainty. Such scrutiny has in the past and may in the future impact our reputation, brand and credibility and result in government and regulatory proceedings, investigations, inquiries and litigation.

Given our businesses are often privy to material non-public information concerning our customers, our data could be improperly used, including for insider trading by our employees and third-party vendors with access to key systems. We have experienced insider trading incidents involving employees in the past, and it is not always possible to deter misconduct by employees or third-party vendors. We take precautions to detect and prevent such activity, including training on insider trading policies for our employees, contractual obligations for our third-party vendors, and policies that require access restrictions for material non-public information, but such precautions are not guaranteed to deter misconduct. Any breach of our clients’ confidences as a result of employee or third-party vendor misconduct could harm our reputation.

Damage to our reputation, credibility, and brand could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
We are exposed to multiple risks associated with the global nature of our operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition or results of operations.

◦
economic and political conditions around the world,
◦
inflation,
◦
high interest rates or fluctuation in interest rates, currency exchange rates or commodities markets,
◦
limitations that foreign governments may impose on the conversion of currency or the payment of dividends or other remittances to us from our non-U.S. subsidiaries,
◦
differing accounting principles and standards,
◦
increases in taxes or changes in U.S. or foreign tax laws (for example, the Pillar Two international tax framework established by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, which includes a global minimum tax of 15%),
