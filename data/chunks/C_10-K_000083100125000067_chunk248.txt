Consumer Loan Securitizations
Beginning in the third quarter of 2023, Citi relaunched a program securitizing other consumer loans into asset-backed securities. The principal securitized and the proceeds from new securitizations for the year ended December 31, 2024 were $
1.2
billion and $
1.2
billion, respectively, compared to $
1
billion and $
0.7
billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2023. The gains recognized on the securitization of consumer loans were $
5.1
million and $
7.5
million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023.
Mortgage Servicing Rights (MSRs)
In connection with the securitization of mortgage loans, Citi’s U.S. consumer mortgage business generally retains the servicing rights, which entitle the Company to a future stream of cash flows based on the outstanding principal balances of the loans and the contractual servicing fee. Failure to service the loans in accordance with contractual requirements may lead to a termination of the servicing rights and the loss of future servicing fees.
These transactions create intangible assets referred to as MSRs, which are recorded at fair value on Citi’s Consolidated Balance Sheet (see Note 26 for the valuation of MSRs). The MSRs correspond to principal loan balances of $
56
billion and $
52
billion as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
The Company receives fees during the course of servicing previously securitized mortgages. The amounts of these fees were as follows:
In the Consolidated Statement of Income these fees are primarily classified as

Re-securitizations
The Company engages in re-securitization transactions backed by either residential or commercial mortgages in which debt securities are transferred to a VIE in exchange for new beneficial interests. Citi did not transfer non-agency (private label) securities to re-securitization entities, nor did Citi hold retained interests in such securitizations during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023.
As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, Citi held no retained interests in private label re-securitization transactions structured by Citi.
The Company also re-securitizes U.S. government-agency-guaranteed mortgage-backed (agency) securities. During the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, Citi transferred agency securities with a fair value of approximately $
22.8
billion and $
17.1
billion, respectively, to re-securitization entities.
As of December 31, 2024, the fair value of Citi-retained interests in agency re-securitization transactions structured by Citi totaled approximately $
1.6
billion (including $
977
million related to re-securitization transactions executed in 2024),
compared to $
1.7
