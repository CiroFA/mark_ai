Additionally in July 2024, Merck and Orion Corporation (Orion) announced the mutual exercise of an option to convert the companies’ ongoing co-development and co-commercialization agreement for opevesostat (MK-5684/ODM-208), an investigational cytochrome P450 11A1 (CYP11A1) inhibitor in Phase 3 clinical development, and other candidates targeting CYP11A1, into an exclusive global license for Merck. With the exercise of the option, Merck assumed full responsibility for all past and future development and commercialization expenses associated with the candidates covered by the original agreement entered into in 2022 as discussed below. In addition, Orion became eligible to receive developmental milestone payments of up to $
30
million, regulatory milestone payments of up to $
625
million and sales-based milestone payments of up to $
975
million, as well as annually tiered royalties ranging from a low double-digit rate up to a rate in the low twenties on net sales for any commercialized licensed product. Orion retained responsibility for the manufacture of clinical and commercial supply for Merck. No payment was associated with the exercise of the option, which became effective in September 2024.
Also in July 2024, Merck notified Kelun-Biotech (a holding subsidiary of Sichuan Kelun Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.) it was terminating the license and collaboration agreement entered into in July 2022 in which Merck gained exclusive worldwide rights for the development, manufacture and commercialization of an investigational antibody drug conjugate (ADC) MK-1200 (SKB315) for the treatment of solid tumors. As a result of this termination, which became effective in September 2024, all rights to SKB315 have reverted to Kelun-Biotech.
In March 2024, Merck acquired Harpoon Therapeutics, Inc. (Harpoon), a clinical-stage immunotherapy company developing a novel class of T-cell engagers designed to harness the power of the body’s immune system to treat patients suffering from cancer and other diseases for $
765
million and also incurred $
56
million of transaction costs. Harpoon’s lead candidate, MK-6070 (formerly HPN328), is a T-cell engager targeting delta-like ligand 3 (DLL3), an inhibitory canonical Notch ligand that is expressed at high levels in small-cell lung cancer and neuroendocrine tumors. The transaction was accounted for as an asset acquisition since MK-6070 represented substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired (excluding cash and deferred income taxes). Merck recorded net assets of $
165
million, as well as a charge of $
