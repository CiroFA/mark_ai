Under the 2024 Credit Facility, we may, subject to certain customary conditions, including approval of relevant lenders, on one or more occasions, increase commitments under the 2024 Credit Facility by an amount not to exceed $
1
billion in the aggregate, and, on one or more occasions, extend the maturity date of the 2024 Credit Facility by
one year
. The 2024 Credit Facility includes a $
500
million sublimit for borrowing swingline loans and a $
250
million sublimit for the issuance of letters of credit. Advances under the unsecured revolving credit facility accrue interest at rates equal to (a) in the case of U.S. dollar borrowings, at our election, either (i) the alternate base rate plus a margin that ranges from
0.0
% to
0.125
%, or (ii) the adjusted term Secured Overnight Finance Rate (SOFR) plus a margin that ranges from
0.7
% to
1.125
%, or (b) in the case of foreign currency borrowings, the interest benchmark for the relevant currency specified in the credit agreement plus a margin that ranges from
0.7
% to
1.125
%. Actual margins under either election are based on our senior debt credit ratings.
The 2024 Credit Facility includes customary affirmative and negative covenants, including a financial covenant that requires us to maintain a ratio of total gross debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), as defined in the agreement, of not greater than
4.00
to 1.00 as measured on a rolling twelve month basis as of the last day of each fiscal quarter. As of July 31, 2024, we were compliant with all required covenants. At July 31, 2024,
no
amounts were outstanding under the 2024 Credit Facility. We paid
no
interest on this unsecured revolving credit facility during the twelve months ended July 31, 2024.

no
amounts were outstanding under this program.
2019 Secured Facility
. On February 19, 2019, a subsidiary of Intuit entered into a secured revolving credit facility with a lender to fund a portion of our loans to qu
alified small businesses (the 2019 Secured Facility). The 2019 Secured Facility is secured by cash and receivables of the subsidiary and is non-recourse to Intuit Inc. We have entered into several amendments to this facility, most recently on July 19, 2024. These amendments primarily increase the facility limit, extend the commitment term and final maturity date, and update the benchmark interest rate. Under the amended 2019 Secured Facility, the facility limit is $
500
million, of which $
300
million is committed and $
200
million is uncommitted. Advances accrue inter
est at adjusted daily simple SOFR plus
1.5
%. Unused portions of the committed credit facility accrue interest at a rate ranging from
0.25
% to
