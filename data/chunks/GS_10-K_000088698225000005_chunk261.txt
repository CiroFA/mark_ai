The firm’s variable interests in VIEs include senior and subordinated debt; loans and lending commitments; limited and general partnership interests; preferred and common equity; derivatives that may include foreign currency, equity and/or credit risk; guarantees; and certain of the fees the firm receives from investment funds. Certain interest rate, foreign currency and credit derivatives the firm enters into with VIEs are not variable interests because they create, rather than absorb, risk.

VIE Consolidation Analysis
The enterprise with a controlling financial interest in a VIE is known as the primary beneficiary and consolidates the VIE. The firm determines whether it is the primary beneficiary of a VIE by performing an analysis that principally considers:
•
Which variable interest holder has the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance;
•
Which variable interest holder has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE;
•
The VIE’s purpose and design, including the risks the VIE was designed to create and pass through to its variable interest holders;
•
The VIE’s capital structure;
•
The terms between the VIE and its variable interest holders and other parties involved with the VIE; and
•
Related-party relationships.
