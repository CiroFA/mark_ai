support issuing an exposure modification order for the product. This determination included a finding that issuance of the exposure modification order is expected to benefit the health of the population as a whole. We also received an exposure modification order for
IQOS
3 in March 2022.
The FDA’s PMTA and MRTP orders do not mean that the agency “approved”
IQOS
.  These authorizations are subject to strict marketing, reporting, and other requirements, and are not a guarantee that the product will remain authorized, particularly if there is a significant uptake in youth or non-smoker initiation.  The FDA will monitor the marketing of the product.
On January 26, 2023, the FDA authorized the marketing of two new tobacco-flavored consumables (
Marlboro
Sienna
HeatSticks
and
Marlboro
Bronze
HeatSticks
) and a modified version of the authorized
Marlboro
Amber
HeatSticks
. These products are line extensions and/or modified versions of the tobacco-flavored consumables for which the FDA had previously issued a marketing granted order. In its assessment, the FDA determined that the three variants of
HeatSticks
were comparable to the previously authorized tobacco-flavored consumables.
On July 5, 2023, we submitted renewal applications to the FDA requesting re-authorization to continue to market those
IQOS
products that previously received an exposure modification order with a modified exposure claim in the United States. These renewal requests were received by the FDA 360 days prior to the stated July 2024 expiration date of the original exposure modification orders, as requested by the FDA in the original orders. On May 9, 2024, the FDA filed for scientific review of our MRTP renewal applications for
IQOS
products and posted materials from these applications. As our applications proceed through the review process, we have responded to FDA requests for additional information. The FDA may make further information requests or conduct subsequent inspections to verify the information we submitted. The FDA did not issue a decision on our MRTP renewal applications prior to the stated July 7, 2024, expiration date of the original exposure modification orders. The MRTP renewal applications were timely filed in accordance with FDA direction, and we believe that

we should be permitted to continue to use the modified exposure claim with respect to those products that received exposure modification orders until the FDA decides on our MRTP renewal applications.
On October 20, 2023, we submitted bundled PMTAs for our
IQOS ILUMA
THS products together with MRTPAs requesting authorization of the exposure reduction marketing order previously granted for
IQOS
blade versions. We submitted these applications at the same time for the FDA to evaluate the PMTAs and MRTPAs concurrently. In March 2024, the FDA formally accepted our bundled PMTAs and MRTPAs. As our applications proceed through the review process, the FDA may request additional information or
