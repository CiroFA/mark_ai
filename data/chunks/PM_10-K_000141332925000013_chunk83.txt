.
Net earnings attributable to PMI of $7.1 billion decreased by $756 million or 9.7%. This decrease was due primarily to the impairment related to the RBH equity investment and a higher effective tax rate, partly offset by higher operating income and higher income from equity investments and securities. Basic earnings per share of $4.53 decreased by 9.8%. Diluted EPS of $4.52 decreased by 10.0%. Excluding an unfavorable currency impact of $0.38, diluted EPS decreased by 2.4%.

Operating Results by Business Segment
2024 compared with 2023
The following discussion compares operating results within each of our segments for 2024 with 2023.

Net revenues increased by 7.9%.  Net revenues, excluding currency and acquisitions, increased by 7.1%, reflecting a favorable pricing variance, mainly driven by higher combustible tobacco pricing; and favorable volume/mix, primarily driven by higher HTU volume,  partly offset by lower cigarette volume and adverse cigarette mix.
The pricing variance for 2023 and 2024 was negatively impacted by the supplemental tax surcharge on heated tobacco products ("HTPs") in Germany, which went into effect in 2022. On March 14, 2024, the Court of Justice of the European Union (the "CJEU") ruled that the German fiscal regulation imposing an additional excise tax on HTPs does not contravene EU law. On May 15, 2024, following the decision issued by CJEU, the Fiscal Court in Dusseldorf (the "FCD") also ruled that the German fiscal regulation imposing an additional excise tax on HTPs does not contravene EU law. The FCD admitted an appeal to the Federal Tax Court. On June 19, 2024, PMI submitted an appeal. The negative impact will continue, at least until the appeal ruling on the legality of the surcharge is concluded. PMI currently accounts for the surcharge as a reduction in net revenues, with amounts withdrawn before May 15, 2024, currently under a payment
