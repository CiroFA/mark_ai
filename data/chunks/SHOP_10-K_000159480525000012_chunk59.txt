rights. Our inability to protect our proprietary technology against unauthorized copying or use, as well as any costly litigation or diversion of our managementâ€™s attention and resources, could delay further sales or the implementation of our solutions, impair the functionality of our platform, prevent or delay introductions of new or enhanced solutions, result in our substituting inferior or more costly technologies into our platform, or injure our reputation. Furthermore, many of our current and potential competitors have the ability to dedicate substantially greater resources to developing and protecting their technology or intellectual property rights than we do.
Our pricing decisions may fail to generate expected results and may adversely affect our ability to attract new merchants and retain existing merchants.
We have changed our pricing models from time to time and expect to do so in the future. Such changes may not yield expected benefits to our business and financial results and could also negatively affect the willingness of merchants to use our products and services. If our pricing models are not optimal, it may adversely affect the profitability of our solutions. Our pricing decisions may also impact the mix of merchant adoption among our plans and negatively impact our overall revenue. Moreover, our merchants may be sensitive to changes in our pricing models compared to prices offered by our competitors. As a result, our pricing decisions may result in loss of market share and in the future we may be required to reduce our prices, which could adversely affect our revenue, gross profit, profitability, financial position and cash flows.
