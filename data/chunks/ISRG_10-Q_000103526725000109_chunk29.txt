arrangements generally include a five-year period of service, with the first year of service provided for free. These service contracts have generally been renewed at the end of the initial contractual service periods.

We generate revenue from our Ion endoluminal system in a business model consistent with the da Vinci surgical system model described above. We generate up-front revenue from the placement of Ion systems through sales or sales-type lease arrangements and recurring revenue over time through fixed-payment or usage-based operating lease arrangements. We also earn recurring revenue from the sales of instruments, accessories, and services. The Ion endoluminal system generally sells for between $500,000 and $815,000. Our instruments and accessories have limited lives and will either expire or wear out as they are used in procedures, at which point they need to be replaced. We typically enter into service contracts at the time systems are sold or leased at an annual fee between $55,000 and $80,000.
Additionally, as part of our ecosystem of products and services, we provide a portfolio of learning offerings and digital solutions. We do not currently generate material revenue from these offerings.
Recurring Revenue
Recurring revenue consists of instruments and accessories revenue, service revenue, and operating lease revenue. Recurring revenue increased to $7.04 billion, or 84% of total revenue in 2024, compared to $5.94 billion, or 83% of total revenue in 2023, and $4.92 billion, or 79% of total revenue in 2022.
Instruments and accessories revenue has grown at a faster rate than systems revenue over time. Instruments and accessories revenue increased to $5.08 billion in 2024, compared to $4.28 billion in 2023 and $3.52 billion in 2022. The increase in instruments and accessories revenue largely reflects continued procedure adoption.
Service revenue was $1.31 billion in 2024, compared to $1.17 billion in 2023 and $1.02 billion in 2022. The increase in service revenue was primarily driven by the growth of the base of installed da Vinci surgical systems producing service revenue. The installed base of da Vinci surgical systems grew 15% to approximately 9,902 as of December 31, 2024; 14% to approximately 8,606 as of December 31, 2023; and 12% to approximately 7,544 as of December 31, 2022.
We use the installed base, number of placements, and utilization of systems as metrics for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. Management believes that the installed base, number of placements, and utilization of systems provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance, as management believes that the installed base, number of placements, and utilization of systems are indicators of the rate of adoption of our robotic-assisted medical procedures as well as an indicator of future recurring revenue. Management believes that both it and investors benefit from referring to the
