International currency translation
For translation of its subsidiaries operating in non-U.S. Dollar currencies, the Company has determined that the local currencies of its international subsidiaries are the functional currencies except those in highly inflationary economies, which are defined as those which have had compound cumulative rates of inflation of 100% or more during the past three years, or where a substantial portion of its cash flows are not in the local currency. For the majority of the Company's subsidiaries the local currency is the functional currency.
In consolidating international subsidiaries, balance sheet currency effects are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. The other current and non-current assets line within the Statement of Cash flows includes the impact of foreign currency translation. This equity account includes the results of translating certain balance sheet assets and liabilities at current exchange rates and some accounts at historical rates, except for those located in highly inflationary economies (Argentina, Turkey and Venezuela). Beginning in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2024, the Company also accounted for operations in Egypt as highly inflationary. The translation of balance sheet accounts for highly inflationary economies are reflected in the operating results.
A rollforward of the changes during fiscal years 2024, 2023 and 2022 for foreign currency translation adjustments is included in Note 13.
