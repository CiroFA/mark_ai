Audit Matter Description
As more fully described in Notes 1 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company recognizes revenue over time for long-term contracts as goods are produced or services are rendered. The Company uses costs incurred as the method for determining progress, and revenue is recognized based on costs incurred to date plus an estimate of margin at completion. The process of estimating margin at completion involves estimating the costs to complete production of goods or rendering of services and comparing those costs to the estimated final revenue amount. Margins on fixed-price development contracts are inherently uncertain in that revenue is fixed while the estimates of costs required to complete these contracts are subject to significant variability. The operational and technical complexities of fixed-price development contracts create financial risk, which could increase the estimates of costs and result in lower margins or material reach-forward losses. The ongoing effects of supply chain and operational inefficiencies compound these complexities and related financial risks.
Given the operational and technical complexities of certain of the Company’s fixed-price development contracts, including the KC-46A Tanker, Commercial Crew, VC-25B Presidential Aircraft, T-7A Redhawk, and MQ-25 contracts and the limited amount of historical data available in certain instances and significant judgments necessary to estimate future costs at completion, auditing these estimates involved extensive audit effort, a high degree of auditor judgment, and required audit professionals with specialized industry experience.
How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit
Our audit procedures related to the cost estimates for the KC-46A Tanker, Commercial Crew, VC-25B Presidential Aircraft, T-7A Redhawk, and MQ-25 fixed-price development contracts included the following, among others:
•
We evaluated the appropriateness and consistency of management’s methods used in developing its cost estimates.
•
We evaluated the reasonableness of judgments made and significant assumptions used by management relating to key cost and schedule estimates, including the effects of supply chain and labor disruptions. We also evaluated the range and probabilities of reasonably possible outcomes, and where management set its point estimate within the range.
•
We evaluated the appropriateness of the timing of the incorporation of changes to key cost estimates, including evaluating the timeline of key events and knowledge points that led to management’s determination that a change in estimate was necessary.
•
We inquired of project management, engineers, supply chain leadership, and others directly involved with the execution of contracts to evaluate management’s ability to achieve the key

cost and schedule estimates, as well as evaluate project status and challenges which may affect total estimated costs to complete.
