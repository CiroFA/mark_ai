LINE OF CREDIT AGREEMENTS
At December 31, 2024, the Company had a line of credit agreement of $
4.0
billion, which expires in June 2028. The Company incurs fees of
0.08
% per annum on the total commitment, which remained unused. Fees and interest rates on this line are primarily based on the Company's long-term credit rating assigned by Moody’s and Standard & Poor's. In addition, the Company's subsidiaries had unused lines of credit that were primarily uncommitted, short-term and denominated in various currencies at local market rates of interest.
The weighted-average interest rate of short-term borrowings was
4.6
% at December 31, 2024 (based on $
5
million of foreign currency bank line borrowings and $
790
million of commercial paper outstanding) and
5.4
% at December 31, 2023 (based on $
120
million of foreign currency bank line borrowings and $
348
million of commercial paper outstanding). At December 31, 2024, $795 million of short-term borrowings and $3.0 billion of current maturities of other debt obligations, were classified as Long-term debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as they are supported by a long-term line of credit agreement expiring in June 2028.
DEBT OBLIGATIONS
The Company has incurred debt obligations principally through public and private offerings and bank loans. There are no provisions in the Company’s debt obligations that would accelerate repayment of debt as a result of a change in credit ratings or a material adverse change in the Company’s business. Certain of the Company’s debt obligations contain cross-acceleration provisions, and restrictions on Company and subsidiary mortgages and the long-term debt of certain subsidiaries. Under certain agreements, the Company has the option to retire debt prior to maturity, either at par or at a premium over par. The Company has no current plans to retire a significant amount of its debt prior to maturity, but continues to look for ways to optimize its debt portfolio.
