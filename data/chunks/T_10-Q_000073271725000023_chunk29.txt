Cash Used in Investing Activities
For the first three months of 2025, cash used in investing activities totaled $4,958 and consisted primarily of $4,277 (including interest during construction) for capital expenditures.
During the first three months of 2025, investing activities also included $95 of FirstNet sustainability payments net of reinvestment, and approximately $560 for our investment in a new strategic partner related to wireline network transformation accounted for under the equity method of accounting.
We enter into multi-year software licensing arrangements, which are typically paid over the license terms of two to five years and referred to as vendor financing. Additionally, for capital improvements, we have negotiated favorable vendor payment terms of 120 days or more with some of our vendors, which are also referred to as vendor financing. Vendor financing is excluded from capital expenditures and reported as financing activities. For the first three months of 2025, vendor financing payments were $203, compared to $841 for the first three months of 2024. Capital expenditures for the first three months of 2025 were $4,277, and when including $203 cash paid for vendor financing, capital investment was $4,480 ($119 lower than the prior-year comparable period).
The vast majority of our capital expenditures are spent on our networks, including product development and related support systems. During the first three months of 2025, we placed $378 of productive assets (primarily software) in service under vendor financing arrangements (compared to $99 in the prior-year comparable period). The amount of capital expenditures is influenced by demand for services and products, capacity needs and network enhancements.
