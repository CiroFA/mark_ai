to 6.3% from 6.9% during this period. General and administrative costs for the six months ended February 28, 2025 decreased $2 million from the six months ended February 29, 2024, and decreased as a percentage of revenues to 6.2% from 6.6% during this period. The decrease as a percentage of revenues for the three and six months ended February 28, 2025 was primarily due to lower labor costs compared to the same periods in fiscal 2024.
