arrangements are discussed below.
AstraZeneca PLC
In 2017, Merck and AstraZeneca PLC (AstraZeneca) entered into a global strategic oncology collaboration to co-develop and co-commercialize AstraZeneca’s Lynparza (olaparib) for multiple cancer types. Independently, Merck and AstraZeneca are developing and commercializing Lynparza in combinations with their respective PD-1 and PD-L1 medicines,
Keytruda
and Imfinzi. The companies are also jointly developing and commercializing AstraZeneca’s Koselugo (selumetinib) for multiple indications. Under the terms of the agreement, AstraZeneca and Merck share the development and commercialization costs for Lynparza and Koselugo monotherapy and non-PD-1/PD-L1 combination therapy opportunities.
Profits from Lynparza and Koselugo product sales generated through monotherapies or combination therapies are shared equally. AstraZeneca is the principal on Lynparza and Koselugo sales transactions. Merck records its share of Lynparza and Koselugo product sales, net of cost of sales and commercialization costs, as alliance revenue, and its share of development costs associated with the collaboration as part of

expenses. Reimbursements received from AstraZeneca for research and development expenses are recognized as reductions to

costs.
As part of the agreement, Merck made an upfront payment to AstraZeneca and also made payments over a multi-year period for certain license options. In addition, the agreement provides for contingent payments from Merck to AstraZeneca related to the successful achievement of sales-based and regulatory milestones.
In 2024, sales of Koselugo triggered a $
100
million sales-based milestone payment from Merck to AstraZeneca. Accordingly, Merck recorded a $
100
million liability (which remained accrued at December 31, 2024 and was subsequently paid in January 2025) and a corresponding increase to the intangible asset related to Koselugo. Merck also recognized $
48
million of cumulative amortization catch-up expense related to the recognition of this milestone in 2024. Merck made a sales-based milestone payment to AstraZeneca of $
400
million in 2022 (which had been previously accrued for). Additionally, in 2022, Merck determined it was probable that sales of Lynparza in the future would trigger a $
600
million sales-based milestone payment from Merck to AstraZeneca. Accordingly, Merck recorded a $
600
million liability (which remained accrued at December 31, 2024 and was

subsequently paid in January 2025) and a corresponding increase to the intangible asset related to Lynparza. Merck also recognized $
250
million of cumulative amortization catch-up expense related to the recognition of this milestone in 2022. Potential future sales-based milestone payments of $
2.0
billion have not yet been accrued as they are not deemed by the Company to be probable at this time.
Lynparza received regulatory approvals triggering
