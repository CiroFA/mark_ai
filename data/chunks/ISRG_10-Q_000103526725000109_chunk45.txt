investments increased by $0.27 billion, compared to $8.83 billion as of December 31, 2024, primarily as a result of cash provided by operating activities and proceeds from stock option exercises and employee stock purchases, partially offset by cash used for taxes paid related to net share settlements of equity awards and capital expenditures.

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (“Financial Statements”) and Notes thereto.
Certain information from our unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income has been summarized below (in millions, except percentages):
Total Revenue
Total revenue increased by 19% to $2.25 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2025, compared to $1.89 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2024, resulting from 18% higher instruments and accessories revenue, 25% higher systems revenue, and 16% higher service revenue.
We generally sell our products and services in local currencies where we have direct distribution channels. Revenue denominated in foreign currencies as a percentage of total revenue was approximately 25% and 26% for the three months ended March 31, 2025, and March 31, 2024, respectively. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on OUS total revenue of $8 million and $11 million for the three months ended March 31, 2025, and 2024, respectively. The impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates was determined by comparing current period revenue converted to USD using exchange rates that were effective in the comparable prior year period, net of the impacts from foreign currency hedging.
Revenue generated in the U.S. accounted for 68% and 66%
of
total revenue in the three months ended March 31, 2025, and March 31, 2024, respectively. We believe that U.S. revenue has accounted for the large majority of total revenue due to U.S. patients’ ability to choose their provider and method of treatment, reimbursement structures supportive of innovation and MIS, and our initial investments focused on U.S. infrastructure. We have been investing in our business in OUS markets, and our OUS procedures have grown faster in proportion to U.S. procedures. We expect that our OUS procedures and revenue will make up a greater portion of our business in the long term.
