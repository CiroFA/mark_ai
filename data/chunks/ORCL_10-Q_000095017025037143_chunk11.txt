STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY
Common Stock Repurchases
Our Board of Directors has approved a program for us to repurchase shares of our common stock. As of February 28, 2025
, approximately $
6.5
billion remained available for stock repurchases pursuant to our stock repurchase program. We repurchased
2.9
million shares for $
450
million during the
nine months ended February 28, 2025
and
9.4
million shares for $
1.1
billion during the
nine months ended February 29, 2024 under the stock repurchase program.
Our stock repurchase authorization does not have an expiration date and the pace of our repurchase activity will depend on factors such as our working capital needs, our cash requirements for acquisitions and dividend payments, our debt repayment obligations or repurchases of our debt, our stock price and economic and market conditions. Our stock repurchases may be effected from time to time through open market purchases or pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan. Our stock repurchase program may be accelerated, suspended, delayed or discontinued at any time.
Dividends on Common Stock
In March 2025
, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $
0.50
per share of our outstanding common stock, an increase of $
0.10
per share over the dividend declared in December 2024. The dividend is payable on
April 23, 2025
to stockholders of record as of the close of business on
April 10, 2025
. Future declarations of dividends and the establishment of future record and payment dates are subject to the final determination of our Board of Directors.
