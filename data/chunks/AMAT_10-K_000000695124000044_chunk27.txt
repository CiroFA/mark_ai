Our ability to successfully expand our business into new and related markets and industries may be adversely affected by a number of factors, including:
•
the need to devote additional resources to develop new products for, and operate in, new markets;
•
the need to develop new sales and technical marketing strategies, and to develop relationships with new customers;
•
differing rates of profitability and growth among multiple businesses;
•
our ability to anticipate demand, capitalize on opportunities, and avoid or minimize risks;
•
the complexity of managing multiple businesses with variations in production planning, execution, supply chain management and logistics;
•
the adoption of new business models, business processes and systems;
•
the complexity of entering into and effectively managing strategic alliances or partnering opportunities;
•
new materials, processes and technologies;
•
the need to attract, motivate and retain employees with skills and expertise in these new areas;
•
new and more diverse customers and suppliers, including some with limited operating histories, uncertain or limited funding, evolving business models or locations in regions where we do not have, or have limited, operations;
•
new or different competitors with potentially more financial or other resources, industry experience and established customer relationships;

We are exposed to risks related to the use of artificial intelligence by us and our competitors.
We are increasingly incorporating artificial intelligence capabilities into the development of technologies and our business operations, and into our products and services. Artificial intelligence technology is complex and rapidly evolving, and may subject us to significant competitive, legal, regulatory, operational and other risks. The implementation of artificial intelligence can be costly, and there is no guarantee that our use of artificial intelligence will enhance our technologies, benefit our business operations, or produce products and services that are preferred by our customers. Our competitors may be more successful in their artificial intelligence strategy and develop superior products and services with the aid of artificial intelligence technology. Additionally, artificial intelligence algorithms or training methodologies may be flawed, and datasets may contain irrelevant, insufficient or biased information, which can cause errors in outputs. This may give rise to legal
