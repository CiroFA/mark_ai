How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit
Our audit procedures related to the judgments necessary to determine the appropriate recognition and processing of revenue included the following, among others:
•
We tested the effectiveness of controls in the revenue recognition processes, including those in place to (a) establish revenue recognition accounting policies for bundled services, (b) record revenue, including any related discounts, in accordance with the established accounting policies, and (c) reconcile the various systems to the Company’s general ledger.
•
With the assistance of our IT specialists, we:
◦
Identified the relevant systems and databases used to process revenue transactions and tested the relevant IT controls over each of those systems and databases.
◦
Performed testing of automated business controls over revenue from domestic residential and business customers.
•
We tested the allocation of revenue for bundled services by selecting a sample of subscriber invoices, evaluating management’s determination of the transaction price and the distinct performance obligations, and recalculating the allocation of transaction price to each performance obligation based on the respective stand-alone selling prices.
•
We tested the accuracy and completeness of the subscriber information used in our audit procedures by selecting a sample of the subscribers, and for those selections agreeing the selected subscriber information to supporting documentation.
•
We developed expectations of revenue at a disaggregated level based on historical transaction prices, changes in stand-alone selling prices and current year volumes. We also developed an expectation of aggregate domestic residential revenue from subscribers based on cash received during the year. We compared those estimates to revenue recognized by the Company.

To determine its reporting units, the Company evaluates the components one level below the segment level and aggregates the components if they have similar economic characteristics. The Company performed a quantitative assessment of goodwill for the Media reporting unit, which involved a comparison of the fair value of the Media reporting unit to its carrying value.
The Company used the discounted cash flow model to estimate fair value, which requires management to make significant judgments related to discount rates and forecasts of expected cash flows. Changes in these assumptions could have a significant impact on either the fair value, the amount of any goodwill impairment charge, or both.
The goodwill balance was $58 billion as of December 31, 2024, of which $20 billion was allocated to the Media reporting unit. Based on the quantitative assessment, the estimated fair value of the Media reporting unit exceeded
