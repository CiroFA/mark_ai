Equity
Common Stock
In February 2020, the Board of Directors of the Company authorized a share buyback program to repurchase up to
100
million shares of our common stock. The program will terminate when the aggregate number of shares purchased reaches

228
million, reflected in Other, and a reduction of noncontrolling interest of $
52
million,
