$287 million for the first quarter of 2025, compared with $318 million for the first quarter of 2024. Provisions for the first quarter of 2025 primarily reflected net provisions related to the credit card portfolio (driven by net charge-offs, partially offset by a reserve release due to a seasonal decline in balances). Provisions for the first quarter of 2024 reflected net provisions related to both the credit card portfolio (driven by net charge-offs) and wholesale loans (driven by impairments).
Operating Expenses
Our operating expenses are primarily influenced by compensation, headcount and levels of business activity. Compensation and benefits includes salaries, estimated year-end discretionary compensation, amortization of equity awards and other items such as benefits. Discretionary compensation is significantly impacted by, among other factors, the level of net revenues, net of provision for credit losses, overall financial performance, prevailing labor markets, business mix, the structure of our share-based awards and the external environment.
The table below presents our operating expenses by line item and headcount.
Three Months Ended March 2025 versus March 2024.
Operating expenses in the consolidated statements of earnings were $9.13 billion for the first quarter of 2025, 5% higher than the first quarter of 2024. Our efficiency ratio was 60.6% for the first quarter of 2025, compared with 60.9% for the first quarter of 2024.
The increase in operating expenses, compared with the first quarter of 2024, primarily reflected significantly higher transaction based expenses and higher compensation and benefits expenses (reflecting improved operating performance), partially offset by significantly lower CIEs expenses, including impairments (largely in depreciation and amortization), and a decrease from the FDIC special assessment fee recognized in the first quarter of 2024 (in other expenses). Net provisions for litigation and regulatory proceedings were $(11) million for the first quarter of 2025, compared with $23 million for the first quarter of 2024.
As of March 2025, headcount was essentially unchanged compared with December 2024.
In the second quarter of 2025, in connection with a planned reduction of headcount, we expect that we will record severance expense of approximately $150 million.

Provision for Taxes
The effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2025 was 16.1%, down from the full year income tax rate of 22.4% for 2024, primarily due to an increase in tax benefits on the settlement of employee share-based awards, partially offset by a decrease in other permanent tax benefits, for the first quarter of 2025 compared with the full year of 2024. The impact of tax benefits related to employee share-based awards was a reduction to provision for taxes for the first quarter of 2025 of approximately $525 million which reduced our effective tax rate by 9.4
