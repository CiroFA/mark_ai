2023 Notes.

3.96
billion, net of debt discount of $
20
million and debt issuance costs of $
24
million, and were used, together with operating cash, to repay the outstanding balance on our unsecured term loan. As of July 31, 2024, $
4.0
billion of the 2023 Notes remained outstanding.
Interest is payable semiannually on March 15 and September 15 of each year. The discount and debt issuance costs are amortized to interest expense over the term of the 2023 Notes under the effective interest method. We paid $
106
