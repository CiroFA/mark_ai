Challenges and criticisms to our environmental and social practices and disclosures, and those of our clients and third parties, including from third parties, who may have diverging views regarding those practices and disclosures, may also harm our reputation.
Increases in market interest rates have resulted in increased focus on asset and liability management, including HTM and AFS securities and related unrealized losses. Perceptions of our liquidity and financial condition, actions by the financial services industry generally, or by certain members or individuals in the industry may harm our reputation. Adverse publicity or negative information posted on social media by employees, the media or otherwise, whether or not factually correct, may trigger a loss of trust or confidence on the part of clients, counterparties, shareholders, investors, debt holders, market analysts, other relevant parties or regulators, adversely impacting our business prospects and results of operations.
We are subject to complex and evolving LRRs and interpretations, including regarding fair lending activity, UDAAP, electronic funds transfers, know-your-customer requirements, data protection and privacy (including the GDPR and the CCPA), cross-border data movement and data localization, cybersecurity, the use and development of AI, data and technology and other matters, as well as evolving and expansive interpretations of these LRRs. Principles concerning the appropriate scope of consumer and commercial privacy vary considerably across jurisdictions, and regulatory and public expectations regarding the definition and scope of consumer and commercial privacy and data protection remains fluid. These laws may be interpreted and applied by various jurisdictions inconsistent with our current or future practices, or with one another. If personal, confidential or proprietary information of clients in our possession, or in the possession of third parties or financial data aggregators, is mishandled, misused or mismanaged, or if we do not timely or adequately address such information, we may face regulatory, legal and operational risks, which could adversely affect our reputation, financial condition and results of operations.
We could suffer reputational harm if we fail to properly identify and manage potential conflicts of interest, the management of which has become increasingly complex as we expand our business activities through more numerous transactions, obligations and interests with and among our clients. The actual or perceived failure to adequately address conflicts of interest could affect the willingness of clients to use our products and services, or result in litigation or enforcement actions, which could adversely affect our business.
Our actual or perceived failure to address these and other issues, such as operational risks, could give rise to reputational risk that could harm us and our business prospects, including the attraction and retention of clients
