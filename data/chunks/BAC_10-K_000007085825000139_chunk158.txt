activity. For more information on net interest yield and FTE basis, see Supplemental Financial Data on page 30, and for more information on interest rate risk management, see Interest Rate Risk Management for the Banking Book on page 78.
Noninterest Income
Noninterest income increased $4.2 billion to $45.8 billion in 2024 compared to 2023. The following highlights the significant changes.
●
Card income increased $230 million primarily due to higher late fees, annual fees and card transfer fees.
●
Service charges increased $371 million primarily due to higher treasury service charges.
●
Investment and brokerage services increased $2.2 billion primarily driven by higher asset management fees due to higher average equity market valuations and positive assets under management (AUM) flows, as well as higher brokerage fees due to increased transactional volume, partially offset by the impact of lower AUM pricing.
●
Investment banking fees increased $1.5 billion primarily due to higher debt and equity issuance fees and higher advisory fees.
●
Market making and similar activities increased $235 million primarily driven by the net $1.6 billion charge resulting from the Bloomberg Short-Term Bank Yield Index’s (BSBY) cessation announced in 2023, partially offset by lower trading revenue from macro products in Fixed Income, Currencies and Commodities (FICC), and lower income from foreign currency risk management activities.
●
Other income decreased $340 million primarily due to higher partnership losses on tax credit investments, a charge related to Visa Inc.’s (Visa) increase in its litigation escrow account, and certain negative valuation adjustments, partially offset by lower losses on sales of available-for-sale debt securities and gains on sales of equity investments.
Provision for Credit Losses
The provision for credit losses increased $1.4 billion to $5.8 billion for 2024 compared to 2023.
