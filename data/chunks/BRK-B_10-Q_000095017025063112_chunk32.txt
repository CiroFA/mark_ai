quarter of 2025 compared to 2024. Revenues from home sales increased $92 million (4.5%), reflecting a 6.3% increase in new home unit sales and higher average selling prices attributable to changes in sales mix. Financial services revenues in the first quarter of 2025 increased 14.7% compared to 2024, primarily due to increased interest income from higher average loan balances. Loan balances, net of allowances for credit losses, were approximately $27.6 billion as of March 31, 2025, an increase of 12.2% since March 31, 2024. Loan portfolio balances are largely funded by borrowings from Berkshire finance affiliates.
Pre-tax earnings of Clayton Homes declined $23 million (5.0%) in the first quarter of 2025 compared to 2024, attributable to lower earnings from financial services, partially offset by higher earnings from manufacturing and site-building activities. The decrease in earnings from financial services earnings was primarily attributable to increases in interest expense on borrowings from Berkshire finance affiliates and losses from homeowner property insurance claims. Interest expense increased $99 million (71.3%) in 2025 versus 2024, as borrowings from affiliates increased $6.6 billion to $24.6 billion at March 31, 2025 compared to March 31, 2024. The corresponding interest income on such borrowings is included in the “Other” earnings section on page 43. The increase in manufacturing and site-building earnings was primarily attributable to the increase in sales, partially offset by lower gross margin rates.
Our other building products businesses generated revenues of approximately $3.2 billion in the first quarter of 2025, a decrease of $123 million (3.6%) versus 2024. The decline was primarily attributable to MiTek and Shaw, due to falling demand and the impact of a divesture in 2025. Pre-tax earnings of our other building products businesses in the first quarter of 2025 declined $93 million (17.0%) compared to 2024. Earnings as a percentage of revenues in the first quarter of 2025 also declined 2.3 percentage points versus 2024. The earnings decline was primarily attributable to overall lower sales and average gross margin rates.
Consumer products
The consumer products group includes leisure vehicles (Forest River), several apparel and footwear operations (including Fruit of the Loom, Garan, H.H. Brown Shoe Group and Brooks Sports) and a manufacturer of high-performance alkaline batteries (Duracell). This group also includes a global toy company (Jazwares), jewelry products (Richline) and custom picture framing products (Larson-Juhl).
Consumer products group revenues were $3.5 billion in the first quarter of 2025, a decline of 0.4% compared to 2024. Revenue increases were generated by Forest River and Brooks Sports, reflecting overall higher volumes and sales mix changes, as well as from Richline, primarily due to the passthrough of higher metals costs. These increases were more than offset by revenue declines across the rest of the
