stock units, respectively, having the following values based on our closing market price of $172.42 per share of common stock on December 31, 2024, other than the deferred restricted common stock units granted to Mr. Gray, Mr. Chae, Mr. Finley and Mr. Sawhney in 2025 in respect of 2024 performance, which are valued as of the date of their grant: Mr. Gray — 250,658 deferred restricted common stock units with an aggregate value of $42,902,020, Mr. Chae — 87,253 deferred restricted common stock units with an aggregate value of $14,789,780, Mr. Finley — 60,427 deferred restricted common stock units with an aggregate value of $10,325,046 and Mr. Sawhney — 74,986 deferred restricted common stock units with an aggregate value of $12,747,088.
Upon a termination of Mr. Gray’s employment without cause, the deferred restricted common stock units granted to him on April 1, 2020, April 1, 2021, April 1, 2022, April 1, 2023 and April 1, 2024 will become fully vested. Had such a termination occurred on December 31, 2024, the last business day of 2024, Mr. Gray would have vested in 1,311,309 deferred restricted common stock units with a value of $226,095,898 based on our closing market price of $172.42 per share of our common stock on December 31, 2024.
In addition, except as described below, unvested carried interest in our carry funds is generally forfeited upon termination of employment. Upon the death or disability of any named executive officer who participates in the carried interest of our carry funds, the named executive officer will be deemed 100% vested in any unvested portion of carried interest in our carry funds. Furthermore, any named executive officer that is Tier I or Tier II retirement eligible will automatically vest in 50% of their otherwise unvested carried interest allocation upon retirement. In addition, pursuant to Mr. Schwarzman’s founding member agreement described above under “Narrative Disclosure to Summary Compensation Table and Grants of Plan-Based Awards in 2024 — Schwarzman Founding Member Agreement,” following retirement and for the remainder of his life, Mr. Schwarzman will be provided with specified retirement benefits, including a car and driver, retention of his current office, administrative support and annual home and personal security benefits. The value of such retirement benefits is estimated at approximately $13.0 million per year based on 2024 costs. We have not assigned a value to the entitlements of Mr. Schwarzman and his estate and related entities to receive carried interest in new funds or to invest in our investment funds fee free following his termination of service as such value cannot be reasonably estimated. We anticipate that any incremental cost to us with respect to the other personal benefits to which Mr. Schwarzman is entitled following his retirement will be de minimis.
