Repurchase of Equity Securities
On June
22, 2022, the Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing the purchase of 30 million shares (the “2022 Repurchase Program”), which was approximately 9% of the total shares of our outstanding common stock at that time. During the fourth quarter of 2024, we repurchased 2.6 million shares under the 2022 Repurchase Program and, as of December 31, 2024, 12.0 million shares remained under the 2022 Repurchase Program. Further discussion relating to our ASR agreements can be found in Note 9 -
Equity
to the Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, in the Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Repurchased shares may be used for general corporate purposes, including the issuance of shares for stock compensation plans and to offset the dilutive effect of the exercise of employee stock options. Our 2022 Repurchase Program has no expiration date and purchases under the program may be made from time to time on the open market and in private transactions, depending on market conditions.
The following table provides information on our purchases of our outstanding common stock during the fourth quarter of 2024 pursuant to our 2022 Repurchase Program (column c). In addition to these purchases, the number of shares in column (a) include shares of common stock that are tendered to us to satisfy our employees’ tax withholding obligations in connection with the vesting of awards of restricted shares (we repurchase such shares based on their fair market value on the vesting date).
There were no other share repurchases during the quarter outside the repurchases noted below.
