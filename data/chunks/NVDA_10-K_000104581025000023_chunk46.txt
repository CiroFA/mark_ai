Additional risks related to acquisitions include, but are not limited to:
•
difficulty in integrating the technology, systems, products, policies, processes, or operations and integrating and retaining the employees, including key personnel, of the acquired business;
•
assumption of liabilities and incurring amortization expenses, impairment charges to goodwill or write-downs of acquired assets;
•
integrating accounting, forecasting and controls, procedures and reporting cycles;
•
coordinating and integrating operations, particularly in countries in which we do not currently operate;
•
stock price impact, fines, fees or reputation harm if we are unable to obtain regulatory approval for an acquisition or are otherwise unable to close an acquisition;
•
potential issuances of debt to finance our acquisitions, resulting in increased debt, increased interest expense, and compliance with debt covenants or other restrictions;
•
the potential for our acquisitions to result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities;
•
the potential variability of the amount and form of any performance-based consideration;
•
negative changes in general economic conditions in the regions or the industries in which we or our target operate;
•
exposure to additional cybersecurity risks and vulnerabilities; and
•
impairment of relationships with, or loss of our or our target’s employees, vendors and customers.
