litigation or claim adjustments, foreign exchange gains and losses, unbudgeted capital expenditures and other such events.
The aggregate of the weighted performance factors for the
three
metrics in each such PSU award determines the percentage of PSUs that will vest at the end of the
three-year
performance cycle. The minimum percentage of such PSUs that can vest is
zero
, with a target percentage of
100
and a maximum percentage of
200
. Each such vested PSU entitles the participant to
one
share of common stock.  An aggregate weighted PSU performance factor of
100
will result in the targeted number of PSUs being vested.  At the end of the performance cycle, participants are entitled to an amount equivalent to the accumulated dividends paid on common stock during the performance cycle for the number of shares earned.  PSU awards do not carry voting rights.
During 2024, the activity for PSU awards was as follows:
During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the grant date fair value of the PSU awards granted to PMI employees and the recorded compensation expense related to PSU awards were as follows:
105
The grant date fair value of the PSU awards subject to the other performance factors was determined by using the market price of PMI’s stock on the date of the grant.  The grant date fair value of the PSU market-based awards subject to the TSR performance factor was determined by using the Monte Carlo simulation model.
The following assumptions were used to determine the grant date fair value of the PSU awards subject to the TSR performance factor for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022:
(a)
Based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve.
(b)
Determined using the observed historical volatility.
The fair value of the PSU award at the date of grant is amortized to expense over the performance period, which is typically
three years
after the date of the award, or upon death, disability or reaching the age of
58
.  As of December 31, 2024, PMI had $
31
million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested PSU awards. This cost is recognized over a weighted-average performance cycle period of approximately
seventeen months
, or upon death, disability or reaching the age of
58
.
During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, share and fair value information for PMI PSU awards that vested were as follows:
Earnings per Share:
Unvested share-based payment awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents are participating securities and therefore are included in PMI’s earnings per share calculation pursuant to the two-class method.
106
Basic and diluted earnings per share (“EPS”) were calculated using the following:
(1)
Including rounding adjustment
For the 2024, 2023 and 2022 computations, there were
no
antidilutive stock awards.
Income Taxes:
Earnings before income taxes and provision for income taxes consisted of the following for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022:
