Revisions
In 2022, the performance of the Leviathan and Tamar fields in Israel and the Bibiyana and Jalalabad fields in Bangladesh were mainly responsible for the 1.8 TCF increase in Asia. In Australia, the 377 BCF decrease was mainly due to updated reservoir characterization of the Wheatstone field. In TCO, entitlement effects and changes in operating assumptions were primarily responsible for the 285 BCF decrease.
In 2023, portfolio optimization decrease of 276 BCF and a reservoir performance decrease of 186 BCF in the Midland and Delaware basins along with a reduction in planned development activities leading to a decrease of 485 BCF in the Haynesville shale formation of east Texas, were mainly responsible for the 1.2 TCF decrease in the United States. In Asia, final investment decision on a new gas pipeline project in Israel and reservoir performance in Bangladesh were mainly responsible for the 481 BCF increase.
In 2024, a decrease of 425 BCF in the DJ basin, primarily related to reservoir performance, was mainly responsible for the 572 BCF decrease in the United States. The 504 BCF increase in Australia was mainly due to reservoir performance of the Jansz Io field.
Extensions and Discoveries
In 2022, extensions and discoveries of 1.6 TCF in the United States were primarily in the Midland and Delaware basins.
In 2023, extensions and discoveries of 660 BCF in the United States were primarily in the Midland and Delaware basins.
In 2024, extensions and discoveries of 912 BCF in the United States were primarily in the DJ basin with 476 BCF, and the Midland and Delaware basins with 432 BCF.

Purchases
In 2023, the acquisition of PDC in the DJ basin was primarily responsible for the 2.2 TCF in the United States.
In 2024, the 177 BCF in the United States was primarily associated with the acquisition of PDC in the DJ basin.
Sales
In 2022, sales of 243 BCF in the United States were primarily in the Eagle Ford shale and Midland and Delaware basins.
In 2024, sales of 260 BCF in Other Americas were from the divestment of shale and tight assets in Canada.
Net Proved Reserves of Natural Gas
