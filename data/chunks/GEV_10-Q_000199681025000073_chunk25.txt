for certain investing and financing
activities.
We typically invest in property, plant, and equipment (
PP&E)
over multiple periods to support new product introductions and increases in
manufacturing capacity and to perform ongoing maintenance of our manufacturing operations. We believe that while PP&E expenditures
will fluctuate period to period, we will need to maintain a material level of net PP&E spend to maintain ongoing operations and growth of the
business.

n past dues
, partially offset by higher billings; an
increase in accounts payable and equipment project payables of $0.4 billion, primarily due to the nonrecurrence of settlements of payables
with GE
prior to the Spin-Off in the first quarter of 2024
; higher net income (after adjusting for depreciation of PP&E, and amortization of
intangible assets) of $0.3 billion; an
increase
in inventories of $0.3 billion, due to higher liquidations in Power and lower purchases of
materials
in Wind; and an increase in contract liabilities and current deferred income of $0.2 billion, primarily due to higher down payments
on orders and slot reservation agreements at Power, partially offset by lower
collections on projects
at Onshore Wind

$1.0 billion
inflow from changes in

by revenue recognition
at Wind; and
current
receivables of $0.9 billion, driven by collections outpacing billings
in Wind and Power and a decrease in past dues; partially offset by inventories of $(0.4) billion, primarily due to
volume
in Power and
Electrification to support fulfillment and deliveries expected in 2025; current contract assets of $(0.3) billion, driven by revenue recognition
exceeding billings, primarily in Power and Wind; and accounts payable and equipment project payables of $(0.3) billion, due to
disbursements outpacing purchases of materials, partially offset by a decrease in prepayments.
