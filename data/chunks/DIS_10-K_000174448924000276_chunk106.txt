SEGMENT INFORMATION
Our operating segments report separate financial information, which is evaluated regularly by the Chief Executive Officer in order to decide how to allocate resources and to assess performance. We do not present a measure of total assets for our reportable segments as this information is not used by management to allocate resources and capital.
Segment operating results reflect earnings before corporate and unallocated shared expenses, restructuring and impairment charges, net other income, net interest expense, income taxes and noncontrolling interests. Segment operating income generally includes equity in the income of investees and excludes impairments of certain equity investments and acquisition accounting amortization of TFCF Corporation (TFCF) and Hulu assets (i.e. intangible assets and the fair value step-up for film and episodic costs) recognized in connection with the TFCF acquisition in fiscal 2019 (TFCF and Hulu acquisition amortization). Corporate and unallocated shared expenses principally consist of corporate functions, executive management and certain unallocated administrative support functions.
Segment operating results include allocations of certain costs, including information technology, pension, legal and other shared services costs, which are allocated based on metrics
