December 31, 2024; cash and cash equivalents, including amounts restricted, decreased $9.0 billion from year-end 2023 to $65.5 billion at December 31, 2024. These decreases reflected a net reduction of bank supplemental funding balances of $29.7 billion and maturities of long-term debt of $3.7 billion. Bank deposits decreased in 2024 by $30.8 billion, which reflected a net decrease in brokered CDs of $20.6 billion, as well as a $9.7 billion decrease in deposits swept from brokerage accounts due to client cash allocations and engagement with equity markets. The Company reduced FHLB borrowings and other short-term borrowings by a net total of $10.3 billion. Partially offsetting the decrease in bank deposits and repayment of borrowings, net investing cash inflows from our AFS and HTM securities totaled $40.9 billion in 2024 and net cash inflows from operations totaled $2.7 billion.
Cash and cash equivalents increased $3.1 billion from year-end 2022 to $43.3 billion at December 31, 2023; cash and cash equivalents, including amounts restricted, increased $15.8 billion to $74.5 billion as of year-end 2023. This increase was driven by net cash provided by investing and operating activities, partially offset by net cash used for financing activities. Bank deposits decreased $76.8 billion in 2023, resulting primarily from a decrease of $113.5 billion in deposits swept from brokerage accounts due to client cash allocation decisions, partially offset by a net increase in brokered CDs of $42.3 billion. Offsetting the decrease in bank deposits, investing cash flows from our AFS and HTM securities totaled $58.9 billion in 2023, cash flows from operating activities totaled $19.6 billion, and the Company increased FHLB borrowings and other short-term borrowings by a total of $15.9 billion in 2023.
