Sales decreased $100 million due to lower organic sales of $48 million in Productivity Solutions and Services driven by a decrease in license and settlement payments, lower organic sales of $21 million in Sensing and Safety Technologies driven by lower demand for personal protective equipment, and unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of $42 million.
During the second quarter of 2022, our Productivity Solutions and Services business entered into a license and settlement agreement (the Agreement). Under the Agreement, we received $360 million, paid in equal quarterly installments over eight quarters, beginning with the second quarter of 2022 and ending with the first quarter of 2024. The Agreement provides each party a license to its existing patent portfolio for use by the other partyâ€™s existing products and resolved the patent-related litigation between the parties.
Segment profit decreased $50 million and segment margin percentage decreased 130 basis points to 17.8% compared to 19.1% for the same period in 2024.
On November 22, 2024, we announced an agreement to sell our PPE business for $1.3 billion, with the assets and liabilities of the business classified as held for sale until the closing date of the sale. The transaction is expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2025.
