Amended and Restated Deferred Compensation and Equity Award Plan (the “DCEAP”)
The DCEAP was adopted in 1993 and amended and restated effective January 1, 2014. Under the Amended and Restated DCEAP, non-management directors receive Promised Fee Shares in connection with deferred annual retainer payments. Each Promised Fee Share is equal in value to one share of the company’s common stock. Upon a director’s retirement or other completion of service as a director, amounts deferred into Promised Fee Shares are payable in either cash and/or shares of the company’s stock either as lump sum or installments pursuant to the director’s distribution election.
