Year in Review
During 2024, we delivered growth in our HIV, Oncology and Liver Disease product sales and continued to invest in our business and research and development (“R&D”) pipeline through advancement of our portfolio and broadening of available therapies, including through acquisitions and collaborations. Meanwhile, we maintained our financial position through repayment of senior notes coming due and the issuance of new senior notes, and provided shareholder returns through dividends and share repurchases. The following represents a summary of notable business updates and events during 2024, including certain items from our press releases, which readers are encouraged to review in full as available on our website at www.gilead.com. The content on the referenced website does not constitute a part of and is not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Virology
•
Completed the New Drug Application submissions to U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) for twice-yearly lenacapavir for HIV prevention.
•
Announced results of PURPOSE 2, the second Phase 3 study of twice-yearly lenacapavir for HIV prevention, with data presented at the HIV Research for Prevention Conference. In the lenacapavir group, 99.9% of participants did not acquire HIV infection, with two incident cases among 2,179 participants. Lenacapavir reduced HIV infections by 96% compared to background HIV incidence in cisgender men and gender-diverse people, and additionally demonstrated superiority to daily Truvada (89% relative risk reduction). Lenacapavir was generally well-tolerated and no significant or new safety concerns were identified. The use of lenacapavir for the prevention of HIV is investigational.
Oncology
•
Received Breakthrough Therapy Designation from FDA to Trodelvy for the treatment of adult patients with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (“ES-SCLC”) whose disease has progressed on or after platinum-based chemotherapy. The use of Trodelvy in ES-SCLC is investigational.
•
Announced plans to voluntarily withdraw the U.S. accelerated approval of Trodelvy for use in pre-treated adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer, following the results of the Phase 3 TROPiCS-04 trial announced in May 2024.
•
Incurred partial impairment charges related to in-process research and development (“IPR&D”) assets acquired by Gilead from Immunomedics, Inc. in 2020 as a result of our evaluation of the Phase 3 EVOKE-01 study data and a strategic decision to discontinue our clinical development program in metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (“NSCLC”) for Trodelvy in the second-line indication (see further information in “Results of Operations; In-Process Research and Development Impairments” below).
