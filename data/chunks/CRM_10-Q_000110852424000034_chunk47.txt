the three and nine months ended October 31, 2024 and 2023, our cash flows were as follows (in millions):
Operating Activities
The net cash provided by operating activities during the nine months ended October 31, 2024 was primarily comprised of net income of $4.5 billion, adjusted for non-cash items, including $2.6 billion of depreciation and amortization and $2.4 billion of stock-based compensation expense. Net cash provided by operating activities can be significantly impacted by factors such as growth in new business, timing of cash receipts from customers, vendor payment terms and timing of payments to vendors. Net cash provided by operating activities during the nine months ended October 31, 2024 was further benefited by
the changes in
accounts receivable, net of $6.7 billion
partially offset by
the change in
unearned revenue of $5.6 billion and the change in accounts payable and accrued expenses and other liabilities of $503 million
