3.375
billion in cash, subject to certain purchase price adjustments, and issued
8,335,849
shares of the Company’s common stock. To the extent certain conditions are met, the Company will pay an additional $
300
million in cash and issue up to
740,961
shares of the Company’s common stock. The Company is actively seeking a strategic partner to acquire ZT Systems' manufacturing business.
Export Restrictions
On April 15, 2025, the Company completed its initial assessment of a new license requirement implemented by the U.S. government for the export of certain semiconductor products to China (including Hong Kong and Macau) and D:5 countries, or to companies headquartered or with an ultimate parent in such countries (the Export Control). The Export Control applies to the Company’s MI308 products. The Company expects to apply for licenses but there is no assurance that licenses will be granted. The Company expects that the Export Control may result in charges of approximately $
800
million in inventory and related reserves.
Tax Matters
The Company previously submitted claims to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) seeking reasonable cause relief related to dual consolidated losses. On April 17, 2025, the IRS approved the Company’s request for relief. The relief, as approved, is estimated to favorably impact the Company’s tax provision in fiscal year 2025 by approximately $
900
million.
