Cash Flow and Net Investment Hedges
The following table summarizes certain information related to cash flow hedges and net investment hedges for 2024, 2023 and 2022. Of the $
5.6
billion after-tax net loss ($
7.5
billion pretax) on derivatives in accumulated OCI at DecemberÂ 31, 2024, losses of $
2.5
billion after-tax ($
3.4
billion pretax) related to both open and closed cash flow hedges are expected to be reclassified into earnings in the next 12 months. These net losses reclassified into earnings are expected to primarily decrease net interest income related to the respective hedged
items. For open cash flow hedges, the maximum length of time over which forecasted transactions are hedged is approximately
five years
. For terminated cash flow hedges, the time period over which the forecasted transactions will be recognized in interest income is approximately
four years
, with the aggregated amount beyond this time period being insignificant.

Accordingly, during the fourth quarter of 2023, the Corporation reclassified $
2.0
billion of pretax loss from accumulated OCI into market making and similar activities for the amount related to these forecasted transactions.
