NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
​
​
​
​
1. ORGANIZATION AND CONSOLIDATION
References to “Deere & Company,” “John Deere,” “Deere,” “we,” “us,” or “our” include our consolidated subsidiaries, unless otherwise stated. We manage our business through the following operating segments: production and precision agriculture (PPA), small agriculture and turf (SAT), construction and forestry (CF), and financial services (John Deere Financial or FS). References to “equipment operations” include PPA, SAT, and CF, while references to “agriculture and turf” include both PPA and SAT.
Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements represent the consolidation of all companies in which Deere & Company has a controlling interest. Certain variable interest entities (VIEs) are consolidated since we are the primary beneficiary. The primary beneficiary has both the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the VIEs’ economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIEs. We consolidate certain VIEs related to retail note securitizations (see Note 12).
We record our investment in each unconsolidated affiliated company (20 to 50 percent ownership) at cost, plus or minus our share of the profit or loss after acquisition, and further reduced for any dividends. Other investments (less than 20 percent ownership) are recorded at cost.
​
Fiscal Year
We use a 52/53 week fiscal year ending on the last Sunday in the reporting period, which generally occurs near the end of October. An additional week is included in the fourth fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign our fiscal quarters with the calendar. The fiscal year ends for 2024, 2023, and 2022 were October 27, 2024, October 29, 2023, and October 30, 2022, respectively. Fiscal years 2024, 2023, and 2022 contained
52
weeks. Unless otherwise stated, references to particular years, quarters, or months refer to our fiscal years and the associated periods in those fiscal years.
Presentation of Amounts
All amounts are presented in millions of dollars, unless otherwise specified. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current period presentation.
Argentina
We have equipment operations and financial services operations in Argentina. The U.S. dollar has historically been the functional currency for our Argentina operations, as our business is indexed to the U.S. dollar due to the highly inflationary conditions. Argentine peso-denominated monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured at each balance sheet date using the
