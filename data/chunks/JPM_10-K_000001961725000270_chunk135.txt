governments or groups, including armed conflict or intensified cyber attacks, could expand in unpredictable ways by drawing in other countries or escalating into full-scale war with potentially catastrophic consequences, particularly if one or more of the combatants possess nuclear weapons. Depending on the scope of the conflict, the hostilities could result in:
•
worldwide economic disruption
•
heightened volatility in financial markets
•
severe declines in asset values, accompanied by widespread sell-offs of investments
•
sudden increases in prices in the energy and commodity markets or for certain safe haven currencies
•
substantial depreciation of local currencies, potentially leading to defaults by borrowers and counterparties in the affected region
•
disruption of global trade
•
diminished consumer, business and investor confidence
•
refugee and humanitarian crises, and
•
new economic sanctions or other regulatory requirements, including those that introduce exceptional compliance challenges for multinational companies such as JPMorganChase.
Any of the above consequences could have significant negative effects on JPMorganChase’s operations and earnings, both in the countries or regions directly affected by the hostilities or globally. Further, if the U.S. were to become directly involved in such a conflict, this could lead to a curtailment of any operations that JPMorganChase may have in the affected countries or region, as well as in any nation that is aligned against the U.S. in the hostilities. JPMorganChase could also experience more numerous and aggressive cyber attacks launched by or under the sponsorship of one or more of the adversaries in such a conflict.
JPMorganChase’s business and operations in certain countries can be adversely affected by local economic, political, regulatory and social factors.
Some of the countries in which JPMorganChase conducts business have economies or markets that are less developed and more volatile or may have political, legal and regulatory regimes that are less established or predictable than other countries in which JPMorganChase operates. In addition, in some jurisdictions in which JPMorganChase conducts business, the local economy and business activities are subject to substantial government influence or control. Some of these countries have in the past experienced economic disruptions, including:
•
extreme currency fluctuations
•
high inflation
•
low or negative growth
•
defaults or reduced ability to service sovereign debt and
•
increased fraud or other misrepresentation of value.
The governments in these countries have sometimes reacted to these developments by imposing restrictive policies that adversely affect the local and regional business environment, such as:
•
price, capital or exchange controls, including imposition of punitive transfer and convertibility restrictions or forced currency exchange
•
expropriation or nationalization of assets, including client assets, or confiscation of
