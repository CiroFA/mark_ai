Citi manages operational risk consistent with the overall framework described in “Managing Global Risk—Overview” above. Citi’s goal is to keep operational risk at appropriate levels relative to the characteristics of its businesses, the markets in which it operates, its capital and liquidity and the competitive, economic and regulatory environment. This includes effectively managing operational risk and maintaining or reducing operational risk exposures within Citi’s operational risk appetite.
Citi’s Independent Operational Risk Management group has established a global Operational Risk Management Framework with policies and practices for identification, measurement, monitoring, controlling and reporting operational risks and the overall operating effectiveness of the internal control environment. As part of this framework, Citi has defined its operational risk appetite and established a Manager’s Control Assessment (MCA) process for self-identification of significant operational risks, assessment of the performance of key controls and mitigation of residual risk above acceptable levels.
Each Citi operating segment must implement operational risk management processes consistent with the requirements of this framework. This includes:
•
understanding and assessing the operational risks they are exposed to;
•
designing, executing and testing controls that mitigate identified risks;
•
establishing key indicators;
•
monitoring and reporting whether the operational risk exposures are in or out of their operational risk appetite;
•
having processes in place to bring operational risk exposures within acceptable levels;
•
periodically estimating and aggregating the operational risks they are exposed to; and
•
ensuring that sufficient resources are available to actively improve the operational risk environment and mitigate emerging risks.
Citi considers operational risks that result from the introduction of new or changes to existing products, or result from significant changes in its organizational structures, systems, processes and personnel.
Citi has a governance structure for the oversight of operational risk exposures through Business Risk and Controls Committees (BRCCs), which are focused at the group, business or function, or geography level. BRCCs provide channels to inform and escalate to senior management about operational risk exposures, control issues and operational risk events, and allow them to take and document decisions around the mitigation, remediation or acceptance of operational risk exposures.
In addition, Independent Risk Management, including the Operational Risk Management group, works proactively with Citi’s businesses and
