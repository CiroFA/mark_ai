“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.
Financial Overview
The table below presents an overview of our financial results and selected financial ratios.
Our target (through-the-cycle) is to achieve ROE within a range of 14% to 16% and ROTE within a range of 15% to 17%.
In the table above:
•
Net earnings to common represents net earnings applicable to common shareholders, which is calculated as net earnings less preferred stock dividends.
•
ROE is calculated by dividing net earnings to common by average monthly common shareholders’ equity.
•
ROTE is calculated by dividing net earnings to common by average monthly tangible common shareholders’ equity. Tangible common shareholders’ equity is calculated as total shareholders’ equity less preferred stock, goodwill and identifiable intangible assets. We believe that tangible common shareholders’ equity is meaningful because it is a measure that we and investors use to assess capital adequacy and that ROTE is meaningful because it measures the performance of businesses consistently, whether they were acquired or developed internally. Tangible common shareholders’ equity and ROTE are non-GAAP measures and may not be comparable to similar non-GAAP measures used by other companies.
The table below presents our average equity and the reconciliation of average common shareholders’ equity to average tangible common shareholders’ equity.
•
Net earnings to average assets is calculated by dividing net earnings by average total assets.
•
Return on shareholders’ equity is calculated by dividing net earnings by average monthly shareholders’ equity.
•
Average equity to average assets is calculated by dividing average total shareholders’ equity by average total assets.
•
Dividend payout ratio is calculated by dividing dividends declared per common share by diluted EPS.
