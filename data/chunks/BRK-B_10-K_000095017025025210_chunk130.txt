Managementâ€™s Discussion and Analysis
Contractual Obligations
We are party to other contracts associated with ongoing business activities, which will result in cash payments to counterparties in future periods. Our annual debt maturities for the next five years are summarized in Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We also currently expect to pay interest on our debt ranging from $4.7 billion in 2025 to $4.1 billion in 2029 based on borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2024. Certain other obligations are included in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, such as operating lease liabilities and shared aircraft repurchase liabilities of NetJets. Estimated payments of these liabilities in each of the next five years are as follows (in billions): $2.0 in 2025; $1.8 in 2026; $2.0 in 2027; $2.2 in 2028; and $1.9 in 2029.
We are also obligated to pay claims arising from our property and casualty insurance companies. Such liabilities, including amounts from retroactive reinsurance, were approximately $148 billion at December 31, 2024. We currently forecast claim payments in 2025 of approximately $38 billion with respect to claims occurring prior to 2025. However, the timing and amount of the payments under insurance and reinsurance contracts are contingent upon the outcome of future events and can be highly uncertain. Actual payments will likely vary, perhaps materially, from forecasted payments. We anticipate that claims payments will be funded by operating cash flows.
Other obligations pertaining to the acquisition of goods or services in the future, such as certain purchase obligations, are not currently reflected in the Consolidated Financial
