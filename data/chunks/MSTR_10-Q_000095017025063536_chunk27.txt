rights with respect to certain amendments to the Company’s certificate of incorporation or the Strife Certificate of Designations, certain business combination transactions and certain other matters. The Company additionally may not create or issue any class or series of stock that ranks senior to the Perpetual Strife Preferred Stock with respect to the payment of dividends and the distribution of assets upon the Company’s liquidation, dissolution or winding up without the consent of the holders of Perpetual Strife Preferred Stock representing at least a majority of the combined outstanding voting power of the Perpetual Strife Preferred Stock, and any voting parity stockholders. However, holders of Perpetual Strife Preferred Stock are not entitled to vote with holders of class A common stock on matters on which holders of class A common stock are entitled to vote.
If (in each case, subject to the Strife Certificate of Designations) less than the full amount of accumulated and unpaid Regular Strife Dividends on the outstanding Perpetual Strife Preferred Stock have been declared and paid by the following Regular Strife Dividend Payment Date in respect of each of (i) four or more consecutive Regular Strife Dividend Payment Dates; and (ii) eight or more consecutive Regular Strife Dividend Payment Dates, then, in each case, subject to certain limitations, the authorized number of the Company’s directors will automatically increase by one (or the Company will vacate the office of one of its directors) and the holders of the Perpetual Strife Preferred Stock, voting together as a single class with the holders of each class or series of “Voting Parity Stock” (as defined in the Strife Certificate of Designations) with similar voting rights regarding the election of directors upon a failure to pay dividends, which similar voting rights are then exercisable, will have the right to elect one director (a “Preferred Strife Stock Director”) to fill such directorship at the Company’s next annual meeting of stockholders (or, if earlier, at a special meeting of the Company’s stockholders called for such purpose). If, thereafter, all accumulated and unpaid Regular Strife Dividends on the outstanding Perpetual Strife Preferred Stock have been paid in full, then the right of the holders of the Perpetual Strife Preferred Stock to elect any Preferred Strife Stock Directors will terminate. Upon the termination of such right with respect to the Perpetual Strife Preferred Stock and all other outstanding Voting Parity Stock, if any, the term of office of each person then serving as a Preferred Strife Stock Director will immediately and automatically terminate (and, if the authorized number of the Company’s directors was increased by one or two, as applicable, in connection with such election, then the authorized number of the Company’s directors will automatically decrease by one or two, as applicable).
