respectively.
Principles of Consolidation
- The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned or controlled subsidiaries.  All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.
Foreign Currency
- The functional currencies of the Company’s international subsidiaries are generally the local currencies of the countries in which the subsidiaries are located.  Foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars using the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date.  Results of operations and cash flows are translated using the average exchange rates throughout the period.  The effect of exchange rate fluctuations on translation of assets and liabilities is included as a component of shareholders’ deficit in accumulated other comprehensive income.  Gains and losses from foreign currency transactions are included in SG&A expense.
Use of Estimates
- The preparation of the Company’s financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, sales and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities.  The Company bases these estimates on historical results and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable, all of which form the basis for making estimates concerning the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources.  Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
- Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, demand deposits, and short-term investments with original maturities of three months or less when purchased.  Cash and cash equivalents are carried at amortized cost on the consolidated balance sheets.  The majority of payments due from financial institutions for the settlement of credit card and debit card transactions process within two business days and are, therefore, classified as cash and cash equivalents.
Investments
- Investments generally consist of certificates of deposit, commercial paper, corporate debt securities, governmental securities, and money market funds, which are classified as available-for-sale.  Available-for-sale debt securities are recorded at fair value, and unrealized gains and losses are recorded, net of tax, as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income.  The proceeds from sales and gross realized gains and losses on available-for-sale debt securities were not significant for any of the periods presented.
Also included in long-term investments is performance-based contingent consideration associated with the sale of the Canadian retail business.  The Company accounts for the contingent consideration under the fair value option under Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 825,
