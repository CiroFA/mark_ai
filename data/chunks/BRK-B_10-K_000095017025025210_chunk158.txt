In applying the acquisition method of accounting, we remeasured our previously held
38.6
% investment in Pilot to fair value as of the acquisition date. We recognized a one-time, non-cash remeasurement gain of approximately $
3.0
billion in the first quarter of 2023, representing the excess of the fair value of that interest over the carrying value under the equity method.
In January 2024, we acquired the remaining noncontrolling interests in Pilot for $
2.6
billion, increasing our ownership of Pilot to
100
%. The acquisition of a noncontrolling interest represents an equity transaction and we recorded an increase of $
517
million to capital in excess of par value for the excess of the carrying value of the noncontrolling interest acquired over the consideration paid, net of deferred income tax liabilities arising from the transaction.
A summary of the values of Pilot’s assets acquired, liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interests
as of January 31, 2023 follows (in millions).
