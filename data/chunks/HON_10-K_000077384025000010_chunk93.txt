subsidiaries (the "Company" or “Honeywell”) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, shareowners’ equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in
Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
As described in Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, management excluded from its assessment the internal control over financial reporting at Air Products’ Liquefied Natural Gas Process Technology and Equipment Business, CAES Systems Holdings LLC, and Carrier Global Corporation’s Global Access Solutions Business, which were acquired on September 30, 2024, August 30, 2024, and June 3, 2024, respectively. The Air Products’ Liquefied Natural Gas Process Technology and Equipment Business, CAES Systems Holdings LLC, and Carrier Global Corporation’s Global Access Solutions Business acquisitions represent less than 4% of both net income and net assets, less than 3% of total revenues, and less than 2% of total assets of the consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2024. Accordingly, our audit did not include the internal control over financial reporting at Air Products’ Liquefied Natural Gas Process Technology and Equipment Business, CAES Systems Holdings LLC, and Carrier Global Corporation’s Global Access Solutions Business.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“generally accepted accounting principles”). Also, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in
Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)
issued by COSO.
