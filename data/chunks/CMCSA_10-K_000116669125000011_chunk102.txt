Our senior notes are unsubordinated and unsecured obligations and are subject to parent and/or subsidiary guarantees. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, substantially all of our debt obligations were fixed-rate debt and our debt had an estimated fair value of $
89.8
billion and $
92.2
billion, respectively. The estimated fair value of our publicly traded debt was primarily based on Level 1 inputs that use quoted market value for the debt. The estimated fair value of debt for which there are no quoted market prices was based on Level 2 inputs that use interest rates available to us for debt with similar terms and remaining maturities.
Revolving Credit Facility and Commercial Paper Program
In May 2024, we entered into a new $
11.8
billion revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks, due May 17, 2029, that may be used for general corporate purposes. We may increase the commitments under the facility up to a total of $
14.8
billion, as well as extend the expiration date to no later than May 17, 2031, subject to the approval of the lenders. The interest rate consists of a benchmark rate plus a borrowing margin that is determined based on Comcast’s credit rating.
As of December 31, 2024, the borrowing margin for borrowings based on the Adjusted Term SOFR Rate, as defined in the agreement, was
0.875
%
. The facility requires that we maintain a certain financial ratio based on debt and EBITDA, as defined in th
e agreement. In connection with our entry into the new credit facility, we terminated our prior credit facility dated as of March 30, 2021.
Our commercial paper program is supported by our revolving credit facility and provides a lower cost source of borrowing to fund short-term working capital requirements.
As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had
no
borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility or our commercial paper program. As of December 31, 2024, amounts available under our revolving credit facility, net of amounts outstanding under our commercial paper program and outstanding letters of credit and bank guarantees, totaled $
11.8
billion.
Letters of Credit and Bank Guarantees
As of December 31, 2024, we and certain of our subsidiaries had undrawn irrevocable standby letters of credit and bank guarantees totaling $
288
million to cover potential fundings under various agreements.
