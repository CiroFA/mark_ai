The conditional conversion feature of the Outstanding Convertible Notes, if triggered, may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results
In the event the conditional conversion feature of the Outstanding Convertible Notes is triggered, holders of the applicable Outstanding Convertible Notes will be entitled to convert such notes at any time during specified periods at their option. If one or more holders elect to convert their Outstanding Convertible Notes, unless we elect to satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering solely shares of our class A common stock (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share), we would be required to settle a portion or all of our conversion obligation through the payment of cash, which could adversely affect our liquidity. Furthermore, even if holders do not elect to convert their Outstanding Convertible Notes, we could be required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all or a portion of the outstanding principal of the applicable Outstanding Convertible Notes as a current rather than long-term liability, which would result in a material reduction of our net working capital.
We use funds from our subsidiaries in order to meet our cash needs and service our indebtedness, including the Outstanding Convertible Notes and our other long-term indebtedness, and certain of our subsidiaries holding digital assets may not provide any dividends, distributions, or other payments to us to fund our obligations and meet our cash needs
We receive dividends, distributions, and other payments from our subsidiaries to fund our obligations, including those arising under the Outstanding Convertible Notes, and our other long-term indebtedness, and meet our cash needs. The operating results of our subsidiaries at any given time may not be sufficient to make dividends, distributions, or other payments to us in order to allow us to make payments on the Outstanding Convertible Notes, and our other long-term indebtedness. In addition, dividends, distributions, or other payments, as well as other transfers of assets, between our subsidiaries and from our subsidiaries to us may be subject to legal, regulatory, or contractual restrictions, which may materially adversely affect our ability to transfer cash within our consolidated companies and our ability to meet our cash needs and service our indebtedness.
