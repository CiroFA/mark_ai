proceeds from the issuance were $
3.96
billion, net of debt discount of $
20
million and debt issuance costs of $
24
million, and were used, together with operating cash, to repay the outstanding balance on our unsecured term loan. As of January 31, 2025, $
4.0
billion of the 2023 Notes remained outstanding.
Interest is payable semiannually on March 15 and September 15 of each year. The discount and debt issuance costs are amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the term of the 2023 Notes. We paid
$
106
million in
interest on the 2023 Notes during the six months ended January 31, 2025, and
no
interest during the six months ended January 31, 2024.
The 2023 Notes are senior unsecured obligations of Intuit and rank equally with all existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness of Intuit and are redeemable by us at any time, subject to a make-whole premium. The indenture governing the 2023 Notes requires us to comply with certain covenants. For example, the 2023 Notes limit our ability to create certain liens and enter into sale and leaseback transactions. As of January 31, 2025, we were compliant with all covenants governing the 2023 Notes.
2024 Credit Facility.
On February 5, 2024, we terminated our amended and restated credit agreement dated November 1, 2021 (2021 Credit Facility), and entered into a credit agreement with certain lenders providing for a $
1.5
billion unsecured revolving credit facility that expires on February 5, 2029 (2024 Credit Facility).
Under the 2024 Credit Facility, we may, subject to certain customary conditions, including approval of relevant lenders, on one or more occasions, increase commitments under the 2024 Credit Facility by an amount not to exceed $
1
billion in the aggregate, and, on one or more occasions, extend the maturity date of the 2024 Credit Facility by
one year
. The 2024 Credit Facility includes a $
500
million sublimit for borrowing swingline loans and a $
250
million sublimit for the issuance of letters of credit. Advances under the 2024 Credit Facility accrue interest at rates equal to (a) in the case of U.S. dollar borrowings, at our election, either (i) the alternate base rate plus a margin that ranges from
0.0
%
to
0.125
%, or (ii) the adjusted term Secured Overnight Finance Rate (SOFR) plus a margin that ranges from
0.7
% to
1.125
%, or (b) in the case of foreign currency borrowings, the interest benchmark for the relevant currency specified in the credit agreement plus a margin that ranges from
0.7
% to
1.125
%. Actual margins under either election are based on our senior debt credit ratings.
The 2024 Credit Facility includes customary affirmative and negative covenants, including a financial covenant that requires us to maintain a ratio of total gross debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), as defined in the agreement, of not greater than
4.00
to 1.00 as measured on a rolling twelve month basis as of the
