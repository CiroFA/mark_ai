The Company is
building a modern company platform, through our GBS organization, that unlocks speed and innovation
throughout the organization, to enable further growth as it modernizes the way it works by focusing on becoming faster, more innovative and more efficient at solving problems for its customers and people.
Our Strategy is aligned with the Company’s capital allocation philosophy of: (i) invest in opportunities to grow the business and drive strong returns, including both capital expenditures as well as investments in technology, digital, and our GBS organization, (ii) prioritize our dividend and (iii) repurchase shares with remaining free cash flow over time.
The Company believes our Strategy builds on our inherent strengths by harnessing the Company’s competitive advantages while leveraging its size, scale, agility and the power of the McDonald’s brand to adapt and adjust to meet customer demands in varying economic environments, including the current industry-wide challenges associated with more discerning consumer spending. Our Strategy is supported by a strong global senior leadership team aimed at executing against the MCD growth pillars, further developing our three platforms and driving long-term growth through increasing guest counts and growing industry market share.
