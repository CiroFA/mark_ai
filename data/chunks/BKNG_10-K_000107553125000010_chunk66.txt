designated as a hedging instrument for accounting purposes are recognized in "Other income (expense), net" in the Consolidated Statements of Operations (see Notes 12 and 18 to our Consolidated Financial Statements). Such foreign currency transaction gains or losses are dependent on the amount of net assets of the Euro functional currency subsidiaries, the amount of the Euro-denominated debt that is designated as a hedge, and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. For more information, see Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors - "
We are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates

Outlook
For the first quarter of 2025, we expect:
•
the year-over-year growth in room nights will be between 5% and 7%;
•
the year-over-year growth in gross bookings will be between 5% and 7%;
•
the year-over-year growth in revenues will be between 2% and 4%; and
•
operating income will be lower than the first quarter of 2024, due in part to the negative impact from the shift in Easter timing versus last year, as well as the negative impact from year-over-year changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Excluding these impacts, we expect operating income will be slightly higher than the first quarter of 2024.
For the full year 2025, we expect:
•
the year-over-year growth in gross bookings will be in a mid single digit percentage range;
•
the year-over-year growth in revenues will be in a mid single digit percentage range; and
•
operating income will be higher than in 2024.
Critical Accounting Estimates
Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP"). Our significant accounting policies and estimates are more fully described in Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of our accounting estimates are important to our financial position and results of operations and require us to make difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. We use our judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in the determination of certain estimates and evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis. Estimates are based on historical experience, terms of existing contracts, our observance of trends in the travel industry, and on other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Matters that involve significant estimates and judgments of management include the valuation of investments in private entities, income taxes, and contingencies.
