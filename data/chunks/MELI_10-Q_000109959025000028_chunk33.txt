indicated:
For the three-month period ended March 31, 2025, the increase in product and technology development expenses as compared to the same period in 2024 was primarily attributable to a: i) $56 million increase in salaries and wages mainly related to the increase of 16% in our product and technology development headcount and increases in amounts accrued under the LTRPs as a consequence of the increase in our common stock price; ii) $20 million increase in other product and technology development expenses mainly related to higher tax withholding in connection with intercompany export services billing duties; and iii) $20 million increase in technology maintenance expenses.
We believe that product and technology development is one of our key competitive advantages and we intend to continue to invest in hiring engineers to meet the increasingly sophisticated product expectations of our customer base.
