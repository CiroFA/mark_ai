manufacturing facilities, overhaul facilities and our supply chain to increase production and strengthen yield in order to improve delivery to our customers. We continue to partner with our suppliers to improve material input, and work with our customers to calibrate future production rates. We are leveraging FLIGHT DECK and partnering with suppliers to improve material input and proactively manage the impact of inflationary pressure by driving cost productivity and adjusting the pricing of our products and services. We expect the impact of supply chain constraints and inflation will continue, and we are continuing to take action to mitigate the impacts.
We support efforts to revitalize domestic manufacturing and are investing $1 billion in U.S manufacturing this year and hiring 5,000 U.S workers. At the same time, we support promoting free and fair trade that ensures the continued strength of the U.S aerospace industry.
As we operate in a highly dynamic tariff environment, we are focused on continuing to deliver our products and services to our customers. Given our global business, tariffs will result in additional cost for us and our suppliers. We are optimizing operations and leveraging existing programs and strategies to reduce the impact from tariffs. Additionally, we are taking measures to control cost and implementing pricing actions to primarily mitigate the remaining impact.
