result in our inability to perform our obligations under agreements we have made with third parties or may otherwise adversely affect our business or results of operations. In addition, our rights against any of our counterparties as a result of a default may not be adequate to compensate us for the resulting harm caused or may not be enforceable at all in some circumstances. We may also be forced to incur additional costs as we attempt to enforce any rights we have against a defaulting counterparty, which could further adversely impact our results of operations.
Our ability to execute our capital return program is subject to certain considerations.
Ordinary dividends are authorized and determined by our Board of Directors in its sole discretion and depend upon a number of factors, including:
•
Cash available for distribution;
•
Our results of operations and anticipated future results of operations;
•
Our financial condition, especially in relation to anticipated future capital needs;
•
The level of distributions paid by comparable companies;
•
Our operating expenses; and
•
Other factors our Board of Directors deems relevant.
We paid a quarterly VROC to our shareholders in the first three quarters of 2024. In the fourth quarter of 2024, we declared an ordinary dividend that incorporated the prior VROC equivalent per share payment and did not make a separate VROC payment. VROC distributions remain an option in elevated price environments, to be authorized and determined by our Board of Directors in its sole discretion and depending on factors it deems relevant. Our Board may determine not to pay a dividend in a quarter or may cease declaring a dividend at any time.
Additionally, as of December 31, 2024, $30.7 billion of repurchase authority remained. In October 2024, our Board of Directors approved an increase from our prior authorization of $45 billion by a total of the lesser of $20 billion or the number of shares issued in our acquisition of Marathon Oil, such that the company is not to exceed $65 billion in aggregate purchases. Our share repurchase program does not obligate us to acquire a specific number of shares during any period, and our decision to commence, discontinue or resume repurchases in any period will depend on the same factors that our Board of Directors may consider when declaring dividends, among other factors. In the past, we have suspended our share repurchase program in response to market downturns, including as a result of the oil market downturn that began in early 2020, and we may do so again in the future.
Any downward revision in the amount of our ordinary dividend or the volume of shares we purchase under our share repurchase program could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.
There are substantial risks with any acquisitions or divestitures we have completed or that we may choose to undertake.
We regularly review our portfolio and pursue growth through acquisitions and seek to divest noncore
