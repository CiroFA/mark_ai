The U.S. economy continued to face tight monetary policy and geopolitical unrest. Amid slower hiring and moderating inflation, the Federal Reserve lowered the federal funds target overnight rate by 100 basis points in the second half of 2024. Management’s macroeconomic outlook reflects sustained current benchmark lending rates, with unemployment remaining relatively flat and modest home price appreciation. Though higher mortgage rates are softening demand and reducing borrower affordability, we expect constrained housing supply to keep home prices relatively stable. Furthermore, credit quality metrics in the Company’s bank loans portfolio remain very strong and have improved in recent quarters. As a result of these factors, we decreased projected loss rates at December 31, 2024, as compared to December 31, 2023.
Bank loan-related nonperforming assets consisted of nonaccrual loans of $
35
million and $
15
million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Nonaccrual loans include nonaccrual troubled debt restructurings recorded prior to the adoption of ASU 2022-02, “

Credit Quality
In addition to monitoring delinquency, Schwab monitors the credit quality of First Mortgages and HELOCs by stratifying the portfolios by the following:
•
Year of origination;
•
Borrower FICO scores at origination (Origination FICO);
•
Updated borrower FICO scores (Updated FICO);
•
Loan-to-value (LTV) ratios at origination (Origination LTV); and
•
Estimated Current LTV ratios (Estimated Current LTV).
Borrowers’ FICO scores are provided by an independent third-party credit reporting service and are generally updated quarterly. The Origination LTV and Estimated Current LTV for a HELOC include any first lien mortgage outstanding on the same property at the time of the HELOC’s origination. The Estimated Current LTV for each loan is updated on a monthly basis by reference to a home price appreciation index.
The credit quality indicators of the Company’s First Mortgages and HELOCs are detailed below:
