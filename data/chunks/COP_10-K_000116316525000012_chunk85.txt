EU Regulation for Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH);

•
U.S. Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), which governs the treatment, storage, and disposal of solid waste;
•
U.S. Federal Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA90), under which owners and operators of onshore facilities and pipelines, lessees or permittees of an area in which an offshore facility is located, and owners and operators of vessels are liable for removal costs and damages that result from a discharge of oil into navigable waters of the U.S.;

These laws and their implementing regulations set limits on emissions and, in the case of discharges to water, establish water quality limits. They also establish standards and impose obligations for the remediation of releases of hazardous substances and hazardous wastes. In most cases, these regulations require permits in association with new or modified operations. These permits can require an applicant to collect substantial information in connection with the application process, which can be expensive and time-consuming. In addition, there can be delays associated with notice and comment periods and the agency’s processing of the application. Many of the delays associated with the permitting process are beyond the control of the applicant.
Many states and foreign countries where we operate also have or are developing, similar environmental laws and regulations governing these same types of activities. While similar, in some cases these regulations may impose additional, or more stringent, requirements that can add to the cost and difficulty of marketing or transporting products across state and international borders.
