Retirement Benefits
Pensions
The net periodic benefit cost (benefit) was a benefit of $106 million, $80 million and $110 million in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
The funded status (pension benefit obligation ("PBO") less the fair value of plan assets) for the U.S. plans was a surplus of $86 million and deficit of $137 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The funded status for non-U.S. plans was a surplus of $464 million and deficit of $207 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. During 2024, the U.S. and non U.S plans derived a benefit from actuarial gains due to higher discount rate environment.
Global pension contributions were $35 million in 2024, $46 million in 2023, and $51 million in 2022. At a minimum, Linde contributes to its pension plans to comply with local regulatory requirements (e.g., ERISA in the U.S.). Discretionary contributions in excess of the local minimum requirements are made based on many factors, including long-term projections of the plans' funded status, the economic environment, potential risk of overfunding, pension insurance costs and alternative uses of cash. Changes to these factors can impact the timing of discretionary contributions from year to year. Estimated required contributions for 2025 are currently expected to be in the range of $25 million to $35 million.
Linde assumes expected returns on plan assets for 2025 of 7.00% and
6.02%
f
or the U.S. and non-U.S. plans, respectively, which are consistent with the long-term expected returns on its investment portfolios.
Excluding the impact of any settlements,
2025
consolidated pension expense is expected to be a benefit of approximately
$145 million
. Th
e benefit derived from the expected return on assets assumption for Linde's most significant plans is anticipated to more than offset the expense from service and interest cost accruals and the higher amortization of deferred losses.
Refer to the Critical Accounting Estimates section and Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for a more detailed discussion of the company’s retirement benefits, including a description of the various retirement plans and the assumptions used in the calculation of net periodic benefit cost (benefit) and funded status.
