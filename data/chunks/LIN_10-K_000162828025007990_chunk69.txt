of the company’s stock options and other factors. The expected life of options granted, which represents the period of time that the options are expected to be outstanding, is based primarily on historical exercise experience. The expected dividend yield is based on the company’s most recent history and expectation of dividend payouts. The risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for a period commensurate with the estimated expected life. If factors change and result in different assumptions in future periods, the stock option expense that the company records for future grants may differ significantly from what the company has recorded in the current period.
The weighted-average fair value of options granted during 2024 was $

($

in 2022) based on the Black-Scholes Options-Pricing model. The increase in the grant date fair value year-over-year is primarily attributable to the increase in the stock price.
The following weighted-average assumptions were used to value the grants in 2024, 2023 and 2022:

301,358
performance-based stock unit awards under the 2021 Plan to senior management that vest, subject to the attainment of pre-established minimum performance criteria, principally on the third anniversary of their date of grant. These awards are tied to either after tax return on capital ("ROC") performance or relative total shareholder return ("TSR") performance versus that of a blended group of companies that is comprised of the S&P 500, excluding the Financial sector, and Eurofirst 300. The actual number of shares issued in settlement of a vested award can range from
