unsecured revolving credit facility.  As of December 31, 2024, we have not borrowed any amount under this revolving credit facility.  As of December 31, 2024, we had approximately $6.2 billion of total content liabilities as reflected on our consolidated balance sheet, some of which is denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Such amount does not include streaming content commitments that do not meet the criteria for liability recognition, the amounts of which are significant. Our substantial indebtedness and other obligations, including streaming content obligations, may require us to use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make debt service payments and pay our other obligations when due, limit our ability to borrow additional funds, limit our flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in our business and industry and place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our less leveraged competitors. For more information on our streaming content obligations, including those not on our consolidated balance sheet, see Note 8,
Commitments and Contingencies,

Risks Related to International Operations
We could be subject to economic, political, regulatory and other risks arising from our international operations.
Operating in international markets requires significant resources and management attention and will subject us to economic, political, regulatory and other risks that may be different from or incremental to those in the U.S.  In addition to the risks that we face in the U.S., our international operations involve risks that could adversely affect our business, including:
•
the need to adapt our content and user interfaces for specific cultural and language differences;
•
difficulties and costs associated with staffing and managing foreign operations;
•
political or social unrest, global hostilities, and economic instability;
•
compliance with laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, UK Bribery Act and other anti-corruption laws, export controls and economic sanctions, and local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials;
•
difficulties in understanding and complying with local laws, regulations and customs in foreign jurisdictions;
•
regulatory requirements or government action, whether in response to enforcement of actual or purported legal and regulatory requirements or otherwise, that results in disruption or non-availability of our service or particular content, administrative enforcement actions, fines, and civil and criminal liability, or increased operating costs in the applicable jurisdiction;
•
application of foreign intellectual property laws, which requires the business to adapt to bespoke compliance rules, or changes to such laws, among other issues, may impact the economics of creating or
