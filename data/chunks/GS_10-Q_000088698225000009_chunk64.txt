The firm designates certain derivatives as fair value hedges to convert a portion of fixed-rate unsecured long-term borrowings not accounted for at fair value into floating-rate obligations. See Note 7 for further information about hedging activities.
The table below presents unsecured long-term borrowings, after giving effect to such hedging activities.
In the table above, the aggregate amounts of unsecured long-term borrowings had weighted average interest rates of
5.50

% related to fixed-rate obligations and
5.65
% related to floating-rate obligations) as of March 2025 and
5.72
% (
4.39

Subordinated Borrowings
Unsecured long-term borrowings includes subordinated debt and junior subordinated debt. Subordinated debt that matures within one year is included in unsecured short-term borrowings. Junior subordinated debt is junior in right of payment to other subordinated borrowings, which are junior to senior borrowings.
Subordinated debt had maturities ranging from 2025 to 2045 as of both March 2025 and December 2024.
The table below presents information about subordinated borrowings.
In the table above, the rate is the weighted average interest rate for these borrowings (excluding borrowings accounted for at fair value under the fair value option), including the effect of fair value hedges used to convert fixed-rate obligations into floating-rate obligations.
