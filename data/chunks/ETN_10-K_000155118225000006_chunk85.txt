Defined Benefits Plans
Pension Plans
During 2024, the fair value of plan assets in the Company’s employee pension plans decreased $244 million to $3,993 million at December 31, 2024. The decrease in plan assets was primarily due to benefit payments and negative currency translation exceeding contributions and asset performance. At December 31, 2024, the net unfunded position of $570 million in pension liabilities consisted of $574 million in plans that have no funding requirements and $227 million in plans that require funding, offset by $231 million in plans that are overfunded.
Funding requirements are a major consideration in making contributions to Eaton’s pension plans. With respect to the Company’s pension plans worldwide, the Company intends to contribute annually not less than the minimum required by applicable law and regulations. In 2024, $110 million was contributed to the pension plans. The Company anticipates making $101 million of contributions to certain pension plans during 2025. The funded status of the Company’s pension plans at the end of 2025, and future contributions, will depend primarily on the actual return on assets during the year and the discount rate used to calculate certain benefits at the end of the year.

Supply Chain Finance Program
A third-party financial institution offers a voluntary supply chain finance (SCF) program that enables certain of the Company’s suppliers, at the supplier’s sole discretion, to sell receivables due from the Company to the financial institution on terms directly negotiated with the financial institution. The SCF program does not have a significant impact on the Company’s liquidity as payments by the Company to participating suppliers are paid to the financial institution on the invoice due date, regardless of whether an individual invoice is sold by the supplier to the financial institution. For additional information on the SCF program, see Note 7.
