dividends over a defined time horizon. EaR complements the VaR metric, which measures the impact of interest rate changes that have an immediate impact on the fair values of our assets and liabilities (i.e., mark-to-market changes). Our exposure to interest rate risk occurs due to a variety of factors, including, but not limited to:
•
Differences in maturity or repricing dates of assets, liabilities, preferred stock and certain off-balance sheet instruments.
•
Differences in the amounts of assets, liabilities, preferred stock and certain off-balance sheet instruments with the same maturity or repricing dates.
•
Certain interest rate sensitive fees.
Corporate Treasury manages the aggregated interest rate risk from all businesses using both cash and derivatives instruments, including available-for-sale and held-to-maturity securities and interest rate derivatives. We measure EaR over a one-year time horizon, including a 100- and 200-basis point instantaneous parallel shock in both short- and long-term interest rates. This sensitivity is calculated relative to a baseline market scenario, which takes into consideration, among other things, the market’s expectation of forward rates, as well as our expectation of future business activity. These scenarios include contractual elements of assets, liabilities, preferred stock, and certain off-balance sheet instruments, such as rates of interest, principal repayment schedules, maturity and reset dates, and any interest rate ceilings or floors, as well as assumptions with respect to our balance sheet size and composition, prepayment behavior and deposit repricing. Deposit repricing is captured by evaluating the change in deposit rate paid relative to the change in market rates (deposit beta) and we calibrate the deposit betas used in our models by using a number of factors, including observed historical behavior, future expectations, funding needs and the competitive landscape. We continuously monitor the performance of our key assumptions against observed behavior and regularly review their sensitivity on our risk metrics.
We manage EaR with a goal to reduce potential volatility resulting from changes in interest rates so it remains within our EaR risk appetite. Our EaR scenario is regularly evaluated and updated, if necessary, to reflect changes in our business plans, market conditions and other macroeconomic factors. While management uses the best information available to estimate EaR, actual results may differ materially as a result of, among other things, changes in the economic environment or assumptions used in the process. We also measure the sensitivity of the economic value of our equity (EVE) to changes in interest rates. Compared to EaR, EVE provides a longer-term measurement of the interest rate risk exposure, primarily on non-trading assets and liabilities, by capturing the net impact of changes in interest rates to the present value of their cash flows.
