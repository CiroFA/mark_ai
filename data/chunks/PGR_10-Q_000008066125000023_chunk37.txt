believe that we have sufficient readily available marketable securities to cover our claim payments and short-term obligations in the event our cash flows from operations were to be negative. While U.S. Treasury securities are viewed as having lower risk than many other investment opportunities, the U.S. Treasury announced it had reached its authorized borrowing limit and defaults under government obligations, including payments related to U.S. Treasury securities, could occur as soon as this summer. Although not likely probable, it is possible that the federal government could fail to raise the federal debt ceiling to avoid default. Any such default would likely have a material adverse impact on our cash flows and the value of our portfolio and our capital position. See
Item 1A, Risk Factors
in our Form 10-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for the year ended December 31, 2024, for a discussion of certain matters that may affect our portfolio and capital position.
Our total capital (debt plus shareholders’ equity) was $35.8 billion, based on book value, at March 31, 2025, compared to $28.7 billion at March 31, 2024, and $32.5 billion at
December 31, 2024. The increase from year-end 2024, primarily reflected the comprehensive income recognized during the first three months of 2025. Our debt-to-total capital ratio was 19.2% at March 31, 2025, 24.0% at March 31, 2024, and 21.2% at December 31, 2024. Our debt-to-total capital ratios were consistent with our financial policy of maintaining a ratio of less than 30%.
None of the covenants on our existing debt securities include rating or credit triggers that would require an adjustment of interest rate or an acceleration of principal payments in the event that our debt securities are downgraded by a rating agency. In April 2025, we renewed the unsecured discretionary line of credit with PNC Bank, National Association, in the maximum principal amount of $300 million. We did not engage in short-term borrowings, including any borrowings under the line of credit, to fund our operations or for liquidity purposes during the reported periods.
We seek to deploy capital in a prudent manner and use multiple data sources and modeling tools to estimate the frequency, severity, and correlation of identified exposures, including, but not limited to, catastrophic and other insured losses, natural disasters, and other significant business interruptions, to estimate our potential capital needs.
During the first three months of 2025, we returned capital to shareholders primarily through common share dividends and common share repurchases. In March 2025, our Board of Directors declared a $0.10 per common share dividend, or $59 million in the aggregate, that was paid in April 2025. In January 2025, we also paid common share dividends declared in the fourth quarter 2024, in the aggregate amount of $2.7 billion, or $4.60 per share (see
Note 9 – Dividends
for further discussion).
