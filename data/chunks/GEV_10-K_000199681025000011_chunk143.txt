Management believes that the expense and cost allocations were determined on a basis that is a reasonable reflection of the utilization of
services provided or the benefit received by the Company. The amounts that would have been, or will be incurred, on a stand-alone basis
could materially differ from the amounts allocated due to economies of scale, difference in management judgment, a requirement for more
or fewer employees, or other factors. Management does not believe, however, that it is practicable to estimate what these expenses would
have been had the Company operated as an independent entity, including any expenses associated with obtaining any of these services
from unaffiliated entities. In addition, the future results of operations, financial position, and cash flows could differ materially from the
historical results presented herein.
