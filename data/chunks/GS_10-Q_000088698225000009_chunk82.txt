based on measures of exposure, which are then risk weighted under the Standardized and Advanced Capital Rules:
•
The Standardized Capital Rules apply prescribed risk-weights, which depend largely on the type of counterparty. The exposure measures for derivatives and securities financing transactions are based on specific formulas which take certain factors into consideration.
•
Under the Advanced Capital Rules, the firm computes risk-weights for wholesale and retail credit exposures in accordance with the Advanced Internal Ratings-Based approach. The exposure measures for derivatives and securities financing transactions are computed utilizing internal models.
•
For both Standardized and Advanced credit RWAs, the risk-weights for securitizations and equities are based on specific required formulaic approaches.
Market Risk
RWAs for market risk in accordance with the Standardized and Advanced Capital Rules are generally consistent. Market RWAs are calculated based on measures of exposure which include the following:
•
Value-at-Risk (VaR) is the potential loss in value of trading assets and liabilities, as well as certain investments, loans, and other financial assets and liabilities accounted for at fair value, due to adverse market movements over a defined time horizon with a specified confidence level.
For both risk management purposes and regulatory capital calculations, the firm uses a single VaR model which captures risks, including those related to interest rates, equity prices, currency rates and commodity prices. However, VaR used for risk management purposes differs from VaR used for regulatory capital requirements (regulatory VaR) due to differences in time horizons, confidence levels and the scope of positions on which VaR is calculated. For risk management purposes, a

VaR is used to determine regulatory VaR exceptions. In addition, the daily net revenues used to determine risk management VaR exceptions (i.e., comparing the daily net revenues to the VaR measure calculated as of the end of the prior business day) include intraday activity, whereas the Capital Framework requires that intraday activity be excluded from daily net revenues when calculating regulatory VaR exceptions. Intraday activity includes bid/offer net revenues, which are more likely than not to be positive by their nature. As a result, there may be differences in the number of VaR exceptions and the amount of daily net revenues calculated for regulatory VaR compared to the amounts calculated for risk management VaR.
