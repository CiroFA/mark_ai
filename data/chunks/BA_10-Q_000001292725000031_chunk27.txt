scheduled to deliver these aircraft in 2025. It is currently unclear how the trade tensions between the U.S. and China will impact deliveries to China.

We are continuing to work through the certification process of the 737-7 and 737-10 models, which have been delayed, while we work through the engineering solution for the engine anti-ice system. As of March 31, 2025, we had approximately 35 737-7 and 737-10 aircraft in inventory. We are following the lead of the FAA as we work through the certification process and the ultimate timing will be determined by the regulators.
If we are unable to deliver aircraft and/or increase future production rates, or certify the 737-7 and 737-10 models consistent with our assumptions, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows will be adversely affected.

767 Program
The 767 assembly line includes the commercial program and a derivative to support the KC-46A Tanker program. We are currently targeting a production rate of approximately 3 aircraft per month. We expect to complete production of the 767 commercial program by 2027. This program has break-even gross margins.

777 and 777X Programs
The accounting quantity for the 777 program extends through year-end 2027. We increased the accounting quantity by 3 units during the three months ended March 31, 2025, because we now expect to produce an additional 3 units in that timeframe. We are currently targeting a combined production rate of 4 per month for the 777/777X programs.
In July 2024, we obtained approval from the FAA to begin the first phase of FAA certification flight testing. The first phase of flight testing was paused starting in August and resumed in January. We obtained approval from the FAA to begin the next phase of certification flight testing, and we began these activities in March 2025.
We continue to anticipate first delivery of the 777-9 to occur in 2026 and the 777-8 Freighter to occur in 2028. First delivery of the 777-8 passenger aircraft is not expected to occur before 2030. We are following the lead of the FAA as we work through the certification process and the ultimate timing will be determined by the regulators.
The 777X program had break-even gross margins at March 31, 2025. The level of profitability on the 777X program will be subject to several factors. These factors include aircraft certification requirements and timing, change incorporation on completed aircraft, production disruption due to labor instability and supply chain disruption, customer considerations, delivery timing and negotiations, further production rate adjustments for the 777X or other commercial aircraft programs, and any change in the accounting quantity. One or more of these factors could result in
