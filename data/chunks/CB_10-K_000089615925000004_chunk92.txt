Effective Income Tax Rate
Our effective tax rate (ETR) was 15.8 percent, 5.4 percent, and 19.1 percent in 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.

A change in the geographic mix of earnings could impact our ETR. The increase in the ETR from 2023 to 2024 was primarily due to a one-time deferred tax benefit recorded in 2023 of $1.14 billion related to the enactment of Bermudaâ€™s new income tax law, and our mix of earnings among various jurisdictions, partially offset by discrete tax items.
