The Company is subject to risks related to its plans to separate Automation and Aerospace Technologies and to spin off its Advanced Materials business into standalone, publicly traded companies.
The Company has previously announced its intent to (i) spin off its Advanced Materials business, which is part of its Energy and Sustainability Solutions reportable business segment (the “AM Spin-off”), and (ii) separate its Aerospace Technologies segment from Automation, which will comprise its Industrial Automation, the Building Automation, and the remainder of the Energy and Sustainability Solutions segments (the “Automation and Aerospace Separation”), into standalone, publicly traded companies, in transactions that are intended to be tax-free for the Company’s shareowners for U.S. federal income tax purposes (together, the “Separations”). The AM Spin-off is expected to continue concurrent with the Automation and Aerospace Separation. Each of the Separations will be subject to the satisfaction of a number of customary conditions, including, among others, finalization of applicable financial statements, the filing and effectiveness of applicable filings (including Form 10 registration statements) with the SEC, assurance that the transactions will be tax-free to Honeywell’s shareowners, receipt of applicable regulatory and other customary approvals, and final approval by Honeywell’s Board of Directors. The failure to satisfy all of the required conditions for either Separation, as well as additional factors such as conditions in the equity and debt markets and other external conditions, including, but not limited to, shareowner actions or challenges relating to either Separation or to other aspects of the Company’s business or strategy, many of which are outside of the Company’s control, could delay the completion of one or both of the Separations relative to their respective anticipated timelines or prevent one or both from occurring. These or other unanticipated developments could also cause one or both of the Separations to occur on terms or conditions that are less favorable than anticipated. Furthermore, there is no guarantee that either of the Separations, if completed, will be successful in meeting its objectives or achieving its intended benefits. Whether or not the Separations are ultimately completed, the Company and our business may face challenges, including as a result of actions or challenges from shareowners, including activist shareowners, that
