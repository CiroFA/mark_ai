our ability to raise additional capital from the equity capital markets on favorable terms or at all);
•
our anticipated financing needs, including the amounts needed to service our indebtedness or other obligations;
•
the degree to which we decide to reinvest any cash generated by our operations or financing activities to fund our future operations;

In addition, subject to a limited exception, our board of directors may choose not to pay accumulated dividends on our series A perpetual strike preferred stock for any reason. Accordingly, we may pay less than the full amount of accumulated dividends on our series A perpetual strike preferred stock.
