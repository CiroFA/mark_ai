GENERAL
The Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements included herein have been prepared by Danaher Corporation (“Danaher” or the “Company”) without audit, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).  In this quarterly report, the terms “Danaher” or the “Company” refer to Danaher Corporation, Danaher Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries, or the consolidated subsidiaries of Danaher Corporation, as the context requires.  Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”) have been condensed or omitted pursuant to SEC rules and regulations; however, the Company believes that the disclosures are adequate to make the information presented not misleading.  The Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements included herein should be read in conjunction with the financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2024 and the Notes thereto included in the Company’s 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed on February 20, 2025 (the “2024 Annual Report”).
In the opinion of the Company, the accompanying financial statements contain all adjustments (consisting of only normal recurring accruals) necessary to present fairly the financial position of the Company as of March 28, 2025 and December 31, 2024, its results of operations for the three-month periods ended March 28, 2025 and March 29, 2024 and its cash flows for each of the three-month periods then ended.
There have been no changes to the Company’s significant accounting policies described in the Company’s 2024 Annual Report that have a material impact on the
