2024 compared with 2023
Cash Flows From Operations
Cash flows from operations was $9,423 million, an increase of $118 million from 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to higher net income, which was partially offset by higher net working capital requirements, including lower inflows for contract liabilities from engineering customer advance payments, and higher cash taxes.
Investing
Net cash used for investing activities was $4,644 million in 2024 compared to $4,670 million in 2023. The decrease was due to lower acquisition spend and higher proceeds from divestiture and asset sales, which more than offset higher capital expenditures.
Capital expenditures in 2024 were $4,497 million, an increase of $710 million from 2023. Capital expenditures during 2024 related primarily to investments in new plant and production equipment for backlog growth requirements.

Financing
Linde’s financing strategy is to secure long-term committed funding by issuing public notes and debentures and commercial paper backed by a long-term bank credit agreement. Linde’s international operations are funded through a combination of local borrowing and intercompany funding to minimize the total cost of funds and to manage and centralize currency exchange exposures. As deemed necessary, Linde manages its exposure to interest-rate changes through the use of financial derivatives (see Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements and Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk).
