Share-Based Compensation and Other Compensation Arrangements
Share-Based Compensation
Our 2023 Incentive Stock Plan, permits awards of incentive and non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock or units, performance restricted stock or units, and other stock and cash-based awards to our employees, officers, directors, consultants, and independent contractors. The aggregate number of shares of our common stock authorized for issuance under the plan is
12,900,000
, plus shares that remained or became available under our 2003 Incentive Stock Plan, as amended and restated. Following approval of our 2023 Incentive Stock Plan in 2023, no further awards have been or may be granted under our 2003 Incentive Stock Plan.
Shares issued under the 2023 Incentive Stock Plan will be funded out of treasury shares, except to the extent there are insufficient treasury shares, in which case new shares will be issued. We believe we currently have adequate treasury shares to satisfy these issuances during 2025.

Stock Options
Options have been granted to our executive officers that are generally scheduled to vest and become exercisable
three years
after the grant date and expire
ten years
after the grant date. If an executive terminates employment because of retirement, layoff, disability, or death, the executive (or beneficiary) may remain eligible to exercise some or all of their stock options depending on certain age and service conditions. The fair values of the stock options granted were estimated using a Monte-Carlo simulation model using the assumptions presented below. The model includes no expected dividend yield.
Stock options granted during 2024 and 2023 were not material.
In February 2022, we granted
348,769
premium-priced stock options to our executive officers as part of our long-term incentive program. These stock options have an exercise price equal to
120
% of the fair market value of our stock on the date of grant. If certain performance measures are met, the exercise price is reduced to
110
% of the grant date fair market value of our stock.
Stock option activity for the year ended December 31, 2024 was as follows:
