FINTECH REGULATIONS
New regulations issued by the Central Banks and other regulators of the countries where the Company operates its Fintech business are described below.
Brazil
In March 2022, the Central Bank of Brazil announced new rules for payment institutions based on their size and complexity and raised standards for required capital. The new framework, which was effective starting in July 2023 with full implementation by January 2025, will extend the application of the rule regarding proportionality of regulatory requirements (currently applicable to conglomerates of financial institutions) to financial conglomerates led by payment institutions. The new rules require a gradual increase, between 2023 and 2025, in the regulatory capital requirements applicable to the Company’s regulated Brazilian subsidiaries based on the following schedule: from July 2023 onwards, 6.75%, from January 2024 onwards, 8.75% and from January 2025 onwards, 10.50%.
On January 2, 2024, article 28 of Law 14,690 came into force, which caps the total amount that may be charged to a credit card holder in the form of interest and financial charges at the value of the original debt. The BACEN also adopted rules in Resolution CMN N° 5,112 that provide guidance and define criteria for calculating the original value of the debt in card revolving and invoice financing operations. To comply with the new regulation, we reduced the duration of the credit card invoice financing plans beginning in January 2024.
On June 28, 2024, Law No. 14,905 was enacted, modifying Decree No. 22,626, known as the "Lei da Usura". The law came into force on August 28, 2024, resulting in operations undertaken with institutions authorized by the BACEN, such as Mercado Pago Instituição de Pagamento Ltda., no longer being subject to the previously imposed interest rate cap.
