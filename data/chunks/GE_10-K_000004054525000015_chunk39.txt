because of the lengthy research and development cycle involved in bringing new engine platforms and other products to market, we cannot predict the economic conditions that will exist

when any new product is ready to enter into service. We also have dependencies on our suppliers and partners for commercial engine programs to develop, manufacture and service their share of an engine, and on the major airframers that we supply to timely and successfully develop, certify and commercialize aircraft that utilize our engines as well as to successfully sell those aircraft against aircraft powered by our competitors. A reduction in spending in the commercial aviation sector, or challenges for key industry participants, could have a significant effect on the demand for our products and services, which could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.
Competitive environment - We are dependent on the maintenance of existing product lines and service relationships,  acceptance by our customers of new product and service introductions, competitive pricing and other terms, and technology and innovation leadership for revenue and earnings growth.
The segments in which we operate are highly competitive in terms of pricing, product and service quality, product development and entry into service, product durability, customer service, financing terms, the ability to respond to shifts in market demand and the ability to attract and retain skilled talent. Our long-term operating results and competitive position also depend substantially upon our ability to continue to improve or upgrade current products and services, to maintain long-term customer relationships and to increase our productivity over time as we perform on long-term service agreements, as well as our ability to develop, introduce, and market new and innovative technology, products, services and platforms, such as the RISE program suite of technologies. In addition, the research and development cycle involved in bringing new products to market is often lengthy, it is inherently difficult to predict the economic conditions or competitive dynamics that will exist when any new product is complete, and our investments, to the extent they result in bringing a product to market, may generate weaker returns than we anticipated at the outset. Our capacity to invest in research and development efforts to advance our technologies, products and services also depends on the financial resources that we have available for such investment relative to other capital allocation priorities. Under-investment in research and development, or investment in technologies that prove to be less competitive in the future (at the expense of alternative investment opportunities not pursued), could lead to loss of sales of our products or services in the future due to the long product development cycles in our business. The amounts that we do
