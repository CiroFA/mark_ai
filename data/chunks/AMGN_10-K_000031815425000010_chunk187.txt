We are involved in and expect future involvement in additional disputes regarding our PCSK9 patents in other jurisdictions and regions. This includes matters filed against us and that we have filed in Germany and Japan.
Germany
In February 2016, the EPO granted European Patent No. 2,215,124 (the EP’124 Patent) to Amgen. This patent describes and claims monoclonal antibodies to PCSK9 and methods of treatment and Sanofi filed an opposition to the patent in the EPO seeking to invalidate it. In November 2016, Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GmbH, Sanofi-Aventis Groupe S.A. and Sanofi Winthrop Industrie S.A. filed a joint opposition against Amgen’s patent, and each of Lilly, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Regeneron) and Strawman Ltd. also filed oppositions to Amgen’s patent. In November 2018, the EPO confirmed the validity of Amgen’s EP’124 Patent, which was appealed to the Technical Board of Appeal (TBA). On October 29, 2020, the TBA upheld the validity of certain claims, including claims that protect Repatha, but ruled that broader claims encompassing PRALUENT were invalid. As a result of the TBA’s decision, national litigations regarding PRALUENT in Germany are in the process of being resolved.
In Germany, Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GmbH and Regeneron filed actions in the Regional Court of Munich seeking damages arising from the provisional enforcement of an injunction against PRALUENT that was lifted after the TBA’s October 2020 ruling. On May 8, 2024, the Regional Court of Munich issued a preliminary decision and scheduled a further oral hearing on January 15, 2025. On November 13, 2024, the Regional Court of Munich scheduled the next hearing in the matter for May 21, 2025.
On July 21, 2022, Sanofi Biotechnology SAS filed an action against Amgen GmbH and Amgen (Europe) B.V. before the Regional Court of Dusseldorf alleging that the marketing and sale of Repatha infringes European Patent No. 2,756,004 (the EP’004 Patent), which Sanofi Biotechnology SAS licensed from Regeneron. Sanofi Biotechnology SAS is seeking

infringement damages and injunctive relief. On May 13, 2024, the Regional Court of Dusseldorf stayed the hearing on Sanofi Biotechnology SAS’ infringement action pending the outcome of Amgen’s Nullity Action against the EP’004 Patent before the German Federal Patent Court.
On August 3, 2023, Amgen GmbH filed a Nullity Action before the German Federal Patent Court seeking invalidation of Regeneron’s EP’004 Patent. Regeneron filed a Statement of Defense on November 20, 2023. On February 29, 2024, the German Federal Patent Court scheduled the main hearing for November 25, 2025.
Unified Patent Court of the European Union
On June 1, 2023, Amgen filed an action before the Munich Local Division of the Unified Patent Court (UPC) against Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GmbH, Sanofi-Aventis Groupe S.A., Sanofi Winthrop Industrie S.A. (collectively, Sanofi-Aventis), and Regeneron alleging that the importation, marketing, sale and
