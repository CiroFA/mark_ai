The company has stock-based compensation plans for its key employees, directors and others. These plans permit the grant of a variety of stock and stock-based awards, including restricted stock units, stock options or performance-based shares, as determined by the compensation committee of the company’s Board of Directors or, for certain non-officer grants, by the company’s employee equity committee, which consists of its chief executive officer. The company generally issues new shares of its common stock to satisfy option exercises and restricted unit vesting. Grants of stock options and restricted units generally provide that in the event of both a change in control of the company and a qualifying termination of an option or unit holder’s employment, all options and service-based restricted unit awards held by the recipient become immediately vested (unless an employment or other agreement with the employee provides for different treatment).
