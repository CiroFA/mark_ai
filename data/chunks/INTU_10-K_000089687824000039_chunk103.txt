The allocation of the Mailchimp purchase price is as follows:
The excess of purchase consideration over the fair value of the net assets acquired was recorded as goodwill, which is primarily attributed to the assembled workforce of Mailchimp and the synergies expected to be achieved. This goodwill is assigned to the Small Business & Self-Employed segment and substantially all is deductible for income tax purposes. We completed the purchase price allocation for the Mailchimp acquisition during the second quarter of fiscal 2023, with no material adjustments to our preliminary purchase price allocation.
Intangible assets consist of customer lists, purchased technology, and trade names/trademarks. We amortize purchased intangible assets on a straight-line basis over their respective useful lives. The weighted-average life of the total acquired identifiable intangible assets is
