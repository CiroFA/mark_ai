Note 21
Accounting for Suspended Exploratory Wells
The company continues to capitalize exploratory well costs after the completion of drilling when the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify completion as a producing well, and the business unit is making sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project. If either condition is not met or if the company obtains information that raises substantial doubt about the economic or operational viability of the project, the exploratory well would be assumed to be impaired, and its costs, net of any salvage value, would be charged to expense.

The following table indicates the changes to the company’s suspended exploratory well costs for the three years ended December 31, 2024:
The following table provides an aging of capitalized well costs and the number of projects for which exploratory well costs have been capitalized for a period greater than one year since the completion of drilling:
*
Certain projects have multiple wells or fields or both.
Of the $
1,645
of exploratory well costs capitalized for more than one year at December 31, 2024, $
847
is related to
seven
projects that had drilling activities underway or firmly planned for the near future. The $
798
balance is related to
seven
projects in areas requiring a major capital expenditure before production could begin and for which additional drilling efforts were not underway or firmly planned for the near future. Additional drilling was not deemed necessary because the presence of hydrocarbons had already been established, and other activities were in process to enable a future decision on project development.
The projects for the $
798
referenced above had the following activities associated with assessing the reserves and the projects’ economic viability: (a) $
383
(
five
projects) – undergoing front-end engineering and design with final investment decision expected within
four years
; (b) $
415
(
two
projects) – development alternatives under review. While progress was being made on all
14
projects, the decision on the recognition of proved reserves under SEC rules in some cases may not occur
