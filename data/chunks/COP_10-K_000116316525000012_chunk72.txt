Operating Segments
We manage our operations through six operating segments, which are primarily defined by geographic region: Alaska; Lower 48; Canada; Europe, Middle East and North Africa; Asia Pacific; and Other International.
Corporate and Other represents income and costs not directly associated with an operating segment, such as most interest income and expense; impacts from certain debt transactions; corporate overhead and certain technology activities, including licensing revenues; and unrealized holding gains or losses on equity securities. All cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments are included in Corporate and Other.
Our key performance indicators, shown in the statistical tables provided at the beginning of the operating segment sections that follow, reflect results from our operations, including commodity prices and production.

Summary Operating Statistics

Total production of 1,987 MBOED increased 161 MBOED or nine percent in 2024 compared with 2023. Production increases include:
•
New wells online in the Lower 48, Alaska, Australia, Canada, China, Libya and Norway.
•
Our acquisition of the remaining working interest in Surmont in the fourth quarter of 2023.
•
Our acquisition of Marathon Oil in the fourth quarter of 2024.
The increase in production during 2024 was partly offset by normal field decline.
After adjusting for closed acquisitions and dispositions, production increased by 69 MBOED or three percent.
