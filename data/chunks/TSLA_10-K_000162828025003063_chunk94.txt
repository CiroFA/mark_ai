Fair Value Assumptions
We use the fair value method in recognizing stock-based compensation expense. Under the fair value method, we estimate the fair value of each stock option award with service or service and performance conditions and the ESPP on the grant date generally using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
The weighted-average assumptions used in the Black-Scholes model for stock options are as follows:
The fair value of RSUs with service or service and performance conditions is measured on the grant date based on the closing fair market value of our common stock. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield for zero-coupon U.S. Treasury notes with maturities approximating each grant’s expected life. We use our historical data in estimating the expected term of our employee grants. The expected volatility is based on the average of the implied volatility of publicly traded options for our common stock and the historical volatility of our common stock.

Other Performance-Based Grants
From time to time, the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors grants certain employees performance-based RSUs and stock options.
As of December 31, 2024, we had unrecognized stock-based compensation expense of $
490
million under these grants to purchase or receive an aggregate
5.0
million shares of our common stock. For awards probable of achievement, we estimate the unrecognized stock-based compensation expense of $
421
million will be recognized over a weighted-average period of
4.0
years.
For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, stock-based compensation expense related to these grants, net of forfeitures, were
