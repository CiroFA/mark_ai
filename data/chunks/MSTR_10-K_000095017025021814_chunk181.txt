representing the pro rata portion of the $
600,000
originally paid by the Company to Mr. Saylor under the Excess Agreement attributable to the period from the date of the Amendment through the end of the original term of the
Excess Agreement. During the third and fourth quarters of 2022 and the first quarter of 2023,
pursuant to the terms of the 2022 Tail Agreement, the Company elected to extend the term of the 2022 Tail Agreement for additional
90
-day periods and paid Mr. Saylor $
150,000
for each such extension.
On June 12, 2023, the Company bound new D&O liability insurance policies (the “2023 Commercial Policies”) with third-party carriers that provide coverage substantially equivalent to the aggregate coverage provided under the Initial Commercial Policies and the Excess Commercial Policies for a policy period running from June 12, 2023 through June 12, 2024 except that the 2023 Commercial Policies also provide coverage for claims made with respect to wrongful acts or omissions occurring prior to the binding of the Initial Commercial Policies subject to exclusions with respect to claims previously noticed to and accepted by an earlier D&O insurer, claims related to acts or omissions giving rise to such claims, and demands, investigations, suits or other proceedings entered against an insured prior to June 24, 2022, as well as future interrelated wrongful acts (collectively, the “Excluded Claims”).
On June 12, 2023, the Company entered into a new indemnification agreement with Mr. Saylor (the “2023 Tail Agreement”) pursuant to which Mr. Saylor agreed to provide coverage that is similar to the coverage provided under the 2022 Tail Agreement, but only to cover the Excluded Claims for an initial one-year term and for a payment of $
157,000
. Pursuant to the terms of the 2023 Tail Agreement, the Company has elected to extend the term of the 2023 Tail Agreement for a period of
one-year
commencing on June 12, 2024, and paid Mr. Saylor $
157,000
during the three months ended June 30, 2024. The Company may elect, at its option, to extend the term under the 2023 Tail Agreement for up to a total of
three
additional
one-year
periods, for $
157,000
per additional one-year term.
Prior to entering into the Original Agreement, Renewed Agreement, Excess Agreement, 2022 Tail Agreement, and 2023 Tail Agreement with Mr. Saylor, the Company obtained and considered market quotes for D&O liability insurance policies. The Company determined that the policies considered at such times would have provided insufficient coverage and would have required substantial premiums to the extent coverage were available, and that obtaining indemnification coverage provided by Mr. Saylor was appropriate and in the best interests of the Company.
