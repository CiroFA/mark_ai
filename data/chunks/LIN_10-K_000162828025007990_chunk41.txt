financial risk management at Linde is to minimize the negative impact of interest rate and foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the company’s earnings, cash flows and equity.
To manage these risks, Linde uses various derivative financial instruments, including interest-rate swaps, treasury rate locks, currency swaps, forward contracts, and commodity contracts. Linde only uses commonly traded and non-leveraged instruments. These contracts are entered into primarily with major banking institutions thereby minimizing the risk of credit loss. Also, see Note 1 and Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for a more complete description of Linde’s accounting policies and use of such instruments.
The following discussion presents the sensitivity of the market value, earnings and cash flows of Linde’s financial instruments to hypothetical changes in interest and exchange rates assuming these changes occurred at December 31, 2024. The range of changes chosen for these discussions reflects Linde’s view of changes which are reasonably possible over a one-year period. Market values represent the present values of projected future cash flows based on interest rate and exchange rate assumptions.
Interest Rate Risk
At December 31, 2024, Linde had debt totaling $21,623 million ($19,373 million at December 31, 2023). For fixed-rate instruments, interest rate changes affect the fair market value but do not impact earnings or cash flows. Conversely, for floating-rate instruments, interest rate changes generally do not affect the fair market value of the instrument but impact future earnings and cash flows, assuming that other factors are held constant. At December 31, 2024, including the impact of derivatives, Linde had fixed-rate debt of $17,584 million and floating-rate debt of $4,039 million, representing 81% and 19%, respectively, of total debt. At December 31, 2023, including the impact of derivatives, Linde had fixed-rate debt of $14,345 million and floating-rate debt of $5,028 million, representing 74% and 26%, respectively, of total debt.
Fixed Rate Debt
This sensitivity analysis assumes that, holding all other variables constant (such as foreign exchange rates, swaps and debt levels), a one hundred basis point increase in interest rates would decrease the unrealized fair market value of the fixed-rate debt portfolio by approximately $918 million ($742 million in 2023). Linde has historically used interest rate swaps and as a result carried derivative assets subject to interest rate risk. All active swaps have been unwound or matured as of December 31, 2024; therefore, the effect of a one hundred basis point increase in interest rates would be $0 as of December 31, 2024 ($65 million increase to derivative assets recorded as of December 31, 2023).
Variable Rate Debt
At December 31, 2024, the after-tax earnings and cash flows impact of a one hundred basis point increase in interest rates, including offsetting impact of derivatives, on the variable-
