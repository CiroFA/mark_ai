The tables below present NEE's and FPL's gross derivative positions at December 31, 2024 and 2023, as required by disclosure rules. However, the majority of the underlying contracts are subject to master netting agreements and generally would not be contractually settled on a gross basis.
Therefore, the tables below also present the derivative positions on a net basis, which reflect the offsetting of positions of certain transactions within the portfolio, the contractual ability to settle contracts under master netting arrangements and the netting of margin cash collateral, as well as the location of the net derivative position on the consolidated balance sheets.

Reflects the netting of approximately $
154
