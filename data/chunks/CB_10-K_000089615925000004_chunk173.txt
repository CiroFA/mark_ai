Century to certain active Chubb companies were approximately $
1.9
billion and $
1.8
billion, respectively, on an undiscounted basis. Chubb believes the active company intercompany reinsurance recoverables, which relate to d
irect liabilities payable over many years, are not impaired. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, Century's carried gross reserves (including reserves assumed from the active Chubb companies) were $
1.6
billion and $
1.7
billion, respectively. Changes in laws and regulations may have an adverse effect on Century's reserves; for example, the enactment of "reviver" statutes relating to claims of sexual molestation may give rise to additional claims that would have been barred by the statutes of limitations in effect at the time of the alleged molestation. Should Century's loss reserves experience adverse development, as a result of such changes or otherwise, in the future and should Century be placed into rehabilitation or liquidation, the reinsurance recoverables due from Century to certain active Chubb companies would be payable only after the payment in full of certain expenses and liabilities, including administrative expense
s and direct policy liabilities. Thus, the intercompany reinsurance recoverables would be at risk to the extent of the shortage of assets remaining to pay these recoverables.

721
million. At December 31, 2024, the remaining unused incurred limit under the Westchester NICO agreement was $
332
million.
