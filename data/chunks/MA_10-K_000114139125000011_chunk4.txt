seek to achieve this transformation by modernizing our card switch to meet evolving needs
Commercial and new payment flows.
We focus on capturing opportunities in commercial payments (both point-of-sale purchases and invoiced payments) and disbursements and remittances (specifically, through Mastercard Move, our collection of money movement capabilities that provides solutions for money transfers to consumers from consumers, businesses or governments).  We do so by:
•
Accelerating secular shift in commercial point-of-sale purchases
by offering differentiated propositions across cards and platforms (both corporate and small business solutions, including expense management, reporting, reconciliation and data insights); expanding distribution of our point-of-sale offerings across financial institutions, new geographies, new channels and small businesses; and growing acceptance
•
Capturing commercial invoiced payments
by driving engagement across buyers and suppliers to, among other things, simplify workflows, release working capital and improve data reconciliation to reduce end-to-end costs; building on our travel offerings to expand into additional select verticals (including business-to-business (“B2B”) marketplaces, trade and logistics, healthcare, consumer packaged goods and pharmaceuticals); and embedding payments into widely used platforms and workflows
•
Modernizing disbursements and remittances
by utilizing Mastercard Move to scale use cases across senders (including consumers, businesses and governments) and receiving consumers (both domestic and cross-border) and expand money movement across our global network of financial institution partners
Services and other solutions.

We offer security solutions, consumer acquisition and engagement, business and market insights, gateway, processing and open banking, among other services and solutions (including ACH batch and real-time account-based payments and solutions).
As we drive value, our services and other solutions generate revenue while helping to accelerate our overall financial performance.  We do so by:
•
Differentiating our payments capabilities
by combining our wide range of services and solutions in various ways to meet the needs and priorities of our
partners, which helps drive market wins and payments growth
•
Enhancing and expanding our suite of services
to better serve our existing customers, including across new buying centers and new capability areas, as well as to reach new customers
•
Scaling distribution
by using our technology platforms to enable us to switch more transactions and deliver more services per transaction, selling directly to customers through a dedicated sales force and global account teams, and embedding services with partners (such as tech platforms, system integrators, processors and other networks) to deliver
