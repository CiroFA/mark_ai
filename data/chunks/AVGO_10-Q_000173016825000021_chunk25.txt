was primarily due to $25,416 million cash paid in connection with the acquisition of VMware, net of cash acquired, in the prior year fiscal period.
Financing Activities
Cash flows from financing activities primarily consist of proceeds and payments related to our borrowings, dividend payments, employee withholding tax payments related to net settled equity awards and authorized stock repurchases. The $24,317 million decrease in cash flows from financing activities during the fiscal quarter ended February 2, 2025 compared to the prior year fiscal period was primarily due to a $23,044 million decrease in net proceeds from borrowings, a $7,156 million increase in payments on debt obligations, a $922 million increase in employee withholding tax payments related to net settled equity awards, and a $339 million increase in dividend payments, offset in part by $7,176 million in stock repurchases in the prior year fiscal period.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
There have been no material changes in market risks from the information presented in Part II, Item 7A. “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk,” in the 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K, except as disclosed below.
Interest Rate Risk
Changes in interest rates affect the fair value of our outstanding fixed rate senior notes. As of February 2, 2025 and November 3, 2024, we had $58.8 billion and $56.3 billion in principal amount of fixed rate senior notes outstanding, and the estimated aggregate fair value of these senior notes was $53.9 billion and $51.4 billion, respectively. As of each of February 2, 2025 and November 3, 2024, a hypothetical 50 basis point change in market interest rates would change the fair value of our fixed rate senior notes by approximately $1.7 billion. However, this hypothetical change in interest rates would not impact the interest expense on our fixed rate senior notes outstanding.
As of February 2, 2025 and November 3, 2024, we had $6.0 billion and $13.6 billion of outstanding term loans, respectively, which are subject to floating interest rates. As of February 2, 2025 and November 3, 2024, a hypothetical 100 basis point change in the interest rate would increase or decrease the interest expense on our term loans for the next 12 months by approximately $61 million and $137 million, respectively. The carrying value of the term loans approximates their fair value as the underlying interest rates are tied to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate.
