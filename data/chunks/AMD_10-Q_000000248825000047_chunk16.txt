on March 24, 2025, we issued $1.5 billion of senior notes, consisting of $875 million aggregate principal amount of our 4.212% Senior Notes due 2026, $625 million aggregate principal amount of our 4.319% Senior Notes due 2028, and $950 million in aggregate amount of commercial paper.
We may issue unsecured commercial paper up to a maximum principal amount outstanding, at any time, of $3.0 billion, with a maturity of up to 397 days from the date of issue. As of March 29, 2025, we had $950 million of commercial paper outstanding, with maturities of up to 60 days.
We have $3.0Â billion available under an unsecured revolving credit facility that expires on April 29, 2027. No funds were drawn from this credit facility during the three months ended March 29, 2025.
As of March 29, 2025, we had unconditional purchase commitments of approximately $8.2 billion, of which $5.6 billion are for the remainder of fiscal year 2025. On an ongoing basis, we work with our suppliers and partners on the timing of payments and deliveries of purchase commitments, taking into account business conditions.
On March 31, 2025, we completed the acquisition of ZT Systems. At the close of the acquisition, we paid $3.375 billion in cash, subject to certain purchase price adjustments, and issued 8,335,849 shares of our common stock. In addition, to the extent certain conditions are met following the closing of the acquisition, we will pay an additional $300 million in cash and issue up to 740,961 shares of our common stock. We are actively seeking a strategic partner to acquire ZT Systems' manufacturing business.
We believe our cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and cash flows from operations along with our revolving credit facility and commercial paper program will be sufficient to fund operations, capital expenditures, purchase commitments and strategic activities over the next 12 months and beyond. We believe we will be able to access the capital markets should we require additional funds. However, we cannot assure that such funds will be available on favorable terms, or at all.
Operating Activities
Our working capital cash inflows and outflows from operations are primarily cash collections from our customers, payments for inventory purchases and payments for employee-related expenditures.
Net cash provided by operating activities was $939 million in the three months ended March 29, 2025, primarily due to our net income of $709 million, adjusted for non-cash and non-operating charges of $1.0 billion and net cash outflows of $0.7 billion from changes in our operating assets and liabilities. The primary drivers of the change in operating assets and liabilities were a $748 million decrease in accounts receivable due to customer payments, and a $682 million increase in inventory primarily to support the continued ramp of Data Center products in advanced process technology nodes.
Net cash provided by operating activities was $521 million in the three months ended March
