merger consideration was transferred. We believe the acquisition of SRS will accelerate the Company’s growth with the Pro. The acquisition is expected to establish the Company as a leading specialty trade distributor across multiple verticals, complement our existing capabilities, and enable us to better serve complex project purchase occasions with the renovator/remodeler.

Net Sales.
Fiscal 2024 consisted of 53 weeks compared to 52 weeks in fiscal 2023. Net sales for fiscal 2024 increased $6.8 billion, or 4.5%, to $159.5 billion. The increase
in net s
ales for fiscal 2024 was primarily driven by SRS, which contributed $6.4 billion of net sales during fiscal 2024, and incremental net sales of approximately $2.5 billion attributable to the additional week in fiscal 2024. This increase in net sales was partially offset by the impact of a negative comparable sales environment, primarily driven by decreases in comparable customer transactions and comparable average ticket.
Online sales, which consist of sales generated online through our websites and mobile applications for products picked up at our stores or delivered to customer locations, represented 15.1% of net sales and increased by 6.6% during fiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023, including the online sales attributable to the additional week in fiscal 2024.
A stronger U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales by $298 million in fiscal 2024.
