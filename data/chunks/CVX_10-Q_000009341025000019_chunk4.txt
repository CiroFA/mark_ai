In the opinion of the company’s management, the interim data includes all adjustments necessary for a fair statement of the results for the interim periods.

The term “earnings” is defined as net income attributable to Chevron.
Certain notes and other information have been condensed or omitted from the interim financial statements presented in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Therefore, these financial statements should be read in conjunction with the company’s 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K.
