Changes to the production schedule due to regulatory requirements or supplier constraints could impact forecasted cost and revenue, with a corresponding impact to the program’s gross margin.
This uncertainty in the production environment enhances the difficulty and complexity of determining the production rate schedule, leading to greater subjectivity in management’s determination of the related cost estimates. Therefore, given the inherent uncertainty of these external factors and significant judgments necessary to estimate the 737 program’s future production rate schedule, auditing these estimates involved extensive audit effort, a high degree of auditor judgment, and required audit professionals with specialized industry experience.

How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit
Our audit procedures related to the production rate schedule used in program accounting estimates for the 737 program included the following, among others:
•
We inquired of those directly involved with the production line to evaluate project status and challenges which may affect the program’s ability to increase production rate.
•
We evaluated the Company’s comprehensive product safety and quality plan, including related program metrics, in response to the findings from the FAA Expert Panel Report and Special Audit Item.
•
We assessed the ongoing communications between the FAA and Boeing on the continued implementation of increased product quality and safety measures.
•
We assessed the implementation status of the comprehensive product safety and quality plan to evaluate if there was contradictory evidence that the program would not meet its production rate schedule.
•
We assessed communication between key suppliers and Boeing related to key supplier delivery constraints or quality issues.
•
We performed inquiries with multiple members of Management (both inside and outside of accounting) to understand the program and Company’s current status and events that could impact key suppliers or the production rate schedule.
•
We performed internet searches to identify potential reports of regulatory requirements, remedies or business considerations, certification timeline, key suppliers delays and other indicators of further delays for the 737 production rate schedule. We evaluated whether any contradictory evidence existed that would indicate that the program would not meet its planned production rate schedule and if any other media information was inconsistent with our knowledge of the Company and 737 program.
•
We performed a sensitivity analysis of the impact of further production delays on the program's estimated gross margin and resulting income statement impacts.
•
We assessed the reasonableness of the program’s production rate schedule, including performing a lookback analysis on management’s ability to estimate monthly production output.
•
We tested the effectiveness of internal controls, including those over the production rate
