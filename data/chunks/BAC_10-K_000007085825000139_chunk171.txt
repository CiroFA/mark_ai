revenue, partially offset by higher noninterest expense.
Revenue increased $2.3 billion to $21.8 billion primarily due to higher sales and trading revenue and investment banking fees. Sales and trading revenue increased $1.4 billion, and excluding net DVA, increased $1.3 billion. These increases were driven by higher revenue in both Equities and FICC. Noninterest expense increased $720 million to $13.9 billion, primarily driven by revenue-related expenses and continued investments in the business, including technology.
Average total assets increased $42.0 billion to $911.7 billion, driven by higher levels of inventory, loan growth and increased financing activity. Year-end total assets increased
$59.0 billion to $876.6 billion driven by the same factors as average assets.
The return on average allocated capital was 12 percent, up from 10 percent, reflecting higher net income. For information on capital allocated to the business segments, see Business Segment Operations on page 35.
