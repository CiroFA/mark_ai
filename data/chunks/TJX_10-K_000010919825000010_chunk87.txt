F-29
The risks of participating in multiemployer pension plans are different from the risks of single-employer pension plans in certain respects, including the following: (a) assets contributed to the multiemployer plan by one employer may be used to provide benefits to employees of other participating employers; (b) if a participating employer stops contributing to the plan, the unfunded obligations of the plan may be borne by the remaining participating employers; (c) if TJX ceases to have an obligation to contribute to a multiemployer plan in which the Company had been a contributing employer, or in certain other circumstances, the Company may be required to pay to the plan an amount based on the Company’s allocable share of the underfunded status of the plan, referred to as a withdrawal liability.
