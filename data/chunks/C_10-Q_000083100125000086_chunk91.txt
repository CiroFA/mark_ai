Consumer Credit Scores (FICO)
The following tables provide details on the Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) scores for Citi’s U.S. consumer loan portfolio based on end-of-period receivables by year of origination. FICO scores are updated monthly for substantially all of the portfolio or, otherwise, on a quarterly basis for the remaining portfolio. Loans that did not have FICO scores as of the prior period have been updated with FICO scores as they become available.
With respect to Citi’s consumer loan portfolio outside of the U.S. as of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024 ($
74.5
billion and $
72.5
billion, respectively), various country-specific or regional credit risk metrics and acquisition and behavior scoring models are leveraged as one of the factors to evaluate the credit quality of customers (see “Consumer Loans and Ratios Outside of North America” below). As a result, details of relevant credit quality indicators for those loans are not comparable to the below FICO score distribution for the U.S. portfolio.
