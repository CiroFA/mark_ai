revenues to 85.2% from 86.3% during this period.
The primary categories of operating expenses include Cost of services, Sales and marketing and General and administrative costs. Cost of services is primarily driven by the cost of people serving our clients, which consists mainly of compensation, subcontractor and other payroll costs, and non-payroll costs such as facilities, technology and travel. Cost of services includes a variety of activities such as: contract delivery; recruiting and training; software development; and integration of acquisitions. Sales and marketing costs are driven primarily by compensation costs for business development activities;
marketing- and advertising-related activities; and certain acquisition-related costs. General and administrative costs primarily include costs for people that are non-client-facing, information systems, office space and certain acquisition-related costs.
Operating expenses by category are as follows:

Cost of Services
Cost of services for fiscal 2024 increased $354 million, or 1%, over fiscal 2023, and decreased as a percentage of revenues to 67.4% from 67.7% during this period. Gross margin for fiscal 2024 increased to 32.6% compared to 32.3% in fiscal 2023. The increase in gross margin for fiscal 2024 was primarily due to lower labor costs, partially offset by higher non-payroll costs, primarily for travel compared to fiscal 2023.
Sales and Marketing
Sales and marketing expense for fiscal 2024 increased $264 million, or 4%, over fiscal 2023, and increased as a percentage of revenues to 10.6% over 10.3% during this period due to higher selling and other business development costs.
General and Administrative Costs
General and administrative costs for fiscal 2024 increased $5 million over fiscal 2023, and decreased as a percentage of revenues to 6.6% from 6.7% during this period.
Business Optimization Costs
During fiscal 2024 and 2023, we recorded business optimization costs of $438 million and $1,063 million, respectively, primarily for employee severance. These business optimization initiatives were completed as of August 31, 2024. For additional information, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
We have presented operating income, operating margin, effective tax rate and diluted earnings per share on a non-GAAP or “adjusted” basis excluding the business optimization costs recorded in fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023, and, with respect to effective tax rate and diluted earnings per share, the impact of an investment gain recorded in fiscal 2023, as we believe doing so facilitates understanding as to the impact of these items and our performance in comparison to the prior periods. While we believe that this non-GAAP financial information is useful in evaluating our operations, this information should be
