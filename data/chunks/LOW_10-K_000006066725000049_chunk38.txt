The inflation or deflation of commodity and other prices could affect our prices, demand for our products, and our sales.
Prices of certain commodity products, including lumber, copper, energy, and other raw materials, are historically volatile and are subject to fluctuations arising from changes in domestic and international supply and demand, inflationary pressures, labor costs, competition, market speculation, government regulations, tariffs and trade restrictions, and periodic delays in delivery.   Rapid and significant changes in commodity and other prices, such as changes in lumber prices, and our ability to pass them on to our customers or manage them through our portfolio strategy, have affected, and may continue to affect, the demand for our products and our sales.

Our access to capital markets depends on our strong credit ratings, the overall condition of such capital markets and our operating performance.  If rating agencies lower or place our credit ratings on a credit watch, or if we experience a deterioration of certain financial ratios, it could adversely affect our ability to access the public debt markets and our cost of funds.  Each of the credit rating agencies reviews its ratings periodically, and there is no guarantee that our current credit ratings will remain the same.  Disruption in the financial markets, including as a result of rising
