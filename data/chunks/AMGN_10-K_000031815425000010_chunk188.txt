use of PRALUENT infringes European Patent 3,666,797 (the EP’797 Patent) seeking an injunction and damages for past infringement. Regeneron filed counterclaims for revocation, but on February 5, 2024, the court transferred the counterclaims to the Central Division of the UPC that is presiding over Sanofi’s revocation action. The Munich Local Division of the UPC scheduled the hearing on our EP’797 Patent infringement action to begin on October 16, 2024.
On June 29, 2023, the Central Division of the UPC served Amgen with an action that was filed by Sanofi-Aventis that seeks revocation of the EP’797 Patent. The Central Division of the UPC scheduled a hearing on the revocation action and on July 16, 2024, the Central Division of the UPC rendered its decision, concluding that the patent claims are invalid and revoked the EP’797 Patent. Subsequently, on July 29, 2024, the Munich Local Division of the UPC stayed Amgen’s action against Sanofi-Aventis alleging that the importation, marketing, sale and use of PRALUENT infringes the EP’797 Patent. On September 13, 2024, Amgen filed a Statement of Appeal with the Court of Appeals to the UPC to set aside the Central Division of the UPC’s decision to revoke the EP’797 Patent. The Court of Appeals scheduled oral arguments to take place on May 22, 2025.
On January 10, 2024, Sanofi Biotechnologies SAS and Regeneron filed an action against Amgen Inc., Amgen Europe B.V., Amgen N.V., Amgen GmbH, Amgen B.V., Amgen SAS, and Amgen S.R.L before the Dusseldorf Local Division of the UPC, alleging infringement of EP 3,536,712 (the EP’712 Patent), which Sanofi Biotechnology SAS licensed from Regeneron. Sanofi and Regeneron are seeking an injunction against the sale, marketing, use, importation, or storage of Repatha for certain specified uses in Belgium, France, Germany, Italy and the Netherlands. Amgen filed counterclaims for invalidity and non-infringement. On September 25, 2024, Sanofi Biotechnologies SAS and Regeneron filed a brief seeking to expand the ongoing action before the Dusseldorf Local Division of the UPC, alleging that Amgen’s Repatha infringes a newly-issued patent, European Patent No. 4,252,857 (the EP’857 Patent), seeking an injunction against the marketing, use, or importation of Repatha in 18 countries (Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Portugal, Romania, Slovenia and Sweden) and damages for past infringement. On December 13, 2024, the Dusseldorf Local Division of the UPC denied Sanofi and Regeneron’s request to extend the complaint and ordered that only the issues of infringement and validity of the EP’712 Patent are to be addressed at an oral hearing scheduled for February 25, 2025. On February 4, 2025, the Dusseldorf Local Division of the UPC formally ordered separation of the EP’857 Patent from the ongoing litigation and ordered Sanofi and Regeneron to file a new Statement of Case by February 28, 2025.
