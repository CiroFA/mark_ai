These unrecognized tax benefits were primarily accrued for the uncertainties with our research tax credits and transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries, which include licensing of intellectual property, providing services and other transactions. During all years presented, we recognized interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for income taxes on our consolidated statements of income. The amount of interest and penalties accrued as of December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022 were $
2.21
billion, $
1.48
billion, and $
1.07
billion, respectively.
If our gross unrecognized tax benefits of $
15.13
billion as of December 31, 2024 were realized in a future period, this would result in a tax benefit of $
10.11
billion within our provision of income taxes at such time.
We are subject to taxation in the United States and various other state and foreign jurisdictions. The material jurisdictions in which we are subject to potential examination include the United States and Ireland. We are under examination by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for our 2017 through 2019 tax years. Our 2014 through 2016 tax years are with the IRS Independent Office of Appeals for certain unresolved issues. Our 2020 and subsequent tax years remain open to examination by the IRS. We are under examination by the Irish Revenue Commissioners for our 2020 tax year and our 2021 and subsequent tax years remain open to examination.
In July 2016, we received a Statutory Notice of Deficiency (Notice) from the IRS related to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries in conjunction with the examination of the 2010 tax year. While the Notice applies only to the 2010 tax year, the IRS stated that it will also apply its position for tax years subsequent to 2010 and has done so in years covered by the second Notice described below. We do not agree with the position of the IRS and have filed a petition in the Tax Court challenging the Notice. On January 15, 2020, the IRS's amendment to answer was filed stating that it planned to assert at trial an adjustment that is higher than the adjustment stated in the Notice. The first session of the trial was completed in March 2020 and the final trial session was completed in August 2022. We expect the Tax Court to issue an opinion in 2025 which will likely provide a transfer pricing value for intellectual property transferred. This value will need to be extrapolated into income adjustments to determine the specific tax liability, which will likely remain in dispute and will not be resolved until the Tax Court enters a decision. If the IRS prevails in its updated position, this could result in an additional federal tax liability of an estimated, aggregate amount of up to approximately $
9.0
billion in excess of the amounts in our originally filed U.S. return, plus interest and any penalties asserted. Once the Tax Court decision is entered, the IRS
