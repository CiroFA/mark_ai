We currently have merchants in more than 175 countries and we expect to continue to expand our international operations and penetration in international markets in the future and to operate with a global workforce in a remote-first work environment. However, our international sales and the use of our platform in various countries subject us to risks that we do not generally face with respect to domestic sales within North America.

•
burdens, complexity and potential delays involved with compliance with foreign laws and regulations and laws and regulations potentially applicable to international or cross-border operations including tariffs and customs, export controls, taxation, copyright, consumer protection, international trade, anti-money laundering, sanctions laws and data privacy and data localization laws that may require that merchant and buyer data and data of consumers with whom we have a direct relationship be stored and processed in a designated territory;
•
potentially restrictive actions by foreign governments or regulators, including actions that prevent or limit access to our platform, services, apps or websites and uncertainty regarding liability for services and content;

•
