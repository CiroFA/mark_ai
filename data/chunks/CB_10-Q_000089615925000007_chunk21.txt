Policy benefits include fair value changes on separate accounts that do not qualify for separate accounting under U.S. GAAP. These gains and losses have been reclassified from Other (income) expense to Policy benefits. Policy benefits also include the impact of realized gains and losses on investment portfolios supporting certain participating policies. These realized gains and losses have been reclassified from net realized gains (losses) to policy benefits. This presentation better reflects the gains and losses from fair value changes in separate account assets and liabilities, and the economics of the participating policies by connecting the investment performance that is shared with policyholders to the liability.
•
Net investment income includes investment income reclassified from Other (income) expense related to partially-owned investment companies (private equity partnerships) where our ownership interest is in excess of three percent. We view investment income from these equity-method private equity partnerships as Net investment income for segment reporting purposes.
