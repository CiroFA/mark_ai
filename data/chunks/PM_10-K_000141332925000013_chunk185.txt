Supply Chain Financing:
PMI has engaged with unaffiliated global financial institutions that offer a voluntary supply chain financing ("SCF") program to some of our suppliers. Under the SCF program, the suppliers may elect, at their sole discretion, to sell PMI's payment obligations to these financial institutions. The suppliers independently negotiate the sale arrangements directly with these financial institutions. PMI does not participate in these negotiations, nor does it have any economic interest in these agreements, or in the designated suppliers’ voluntary decision to sell PMI's payment obligations to these financial institutions. No guarantees or securities are provided by PMI or any of its subsidiaries under the SCF programs. PMI's obligations to its suppliers, including amounts due and scheduled payment terms are not impacted by the suppliers’ decision to sell amounts under the SCF program. The payment terms of PMI’s suppliers generally do not exceed
120
days. All outstanding payable amounts related to suppliers that are participating in the SCF program are recorded in
accounts payable
in PMI's consolidated balance sheets. The associated payments are included in cash flows from operating activities within PMI's consolidated statement of cash flows.
