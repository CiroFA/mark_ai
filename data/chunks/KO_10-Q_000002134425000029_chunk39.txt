in place, we expect foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations will have an unfavorable impact on our full year 2025 net operating revenues.
Gross Profit Margin
Gross profit margin is a ratio calculated by dividing gross profit by net operating revenues. Management believes gross profit margin provides investors with useful information related to the profitability of our business prior to considering all of the selling, general and administrative expenses and other operating charges incurred. Management uses this measure in making financial, operating and planning decisions and in evaluating the Company’s performance.
Our gross profit margin increased to 62.6% for the three months ended March 28, 2025, compared to 62.5% for the three months ended March 29, 2024. The increase was primarily due to the impact of favorable pricing initiatives and the refranchising of our bottling operations in the Philippines, Bangladesh and certain territories in India, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and higher commodity costs.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses
During the three months ended March 28, 2025, selling, general and administrative expenses was $3,234 million, compared to $3,351 million during the three months ended March 29, 2024, a decrease of $117 million, or 4%. The decrease was primarily due to the refranchising of our bottling operations in the Philippines, Bangladesh and certain territories in India as well as an unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate impact of 3%. Advertising expenses for the three months ended March 28, 2025 and March 29, 2024 were $1,089 million and $1,161 million, respectively.
As of March 28, 2025, we had $391 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested stock-based compensation awards granted under our plans, which we expect to recognize over a weighted-average period of 2.0 years as stock-based compensation expense. This expected cost does not include the impact of any future stock-based compensation awards.
Other Operating Charges
Other operating charges incurred by our operating segments and Corporate were as follows (in millions):
During the three months ended March 28, 2025, the Company recorded other operating charges of $73 million. These charges consisted of $47 million related to the remeasurement of our contingent consideration liability to fair value in conjunction with our acquisition of fairlife in 2020, which brought the total liability to $6,173 million and was paid in March 2025. Additionally, other operating charges included $11 million related to the Company’s productivity and reinvestment program, $9 million related to an indemnification agreement entered into as a part of the refranchising of certain of our bottling operations, $3 million for the amortization of noncompete agreements related to the BodyArmor acquisition and $3 million related to tax litigation expense.
