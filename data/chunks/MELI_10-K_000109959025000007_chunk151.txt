value of the Company’s financial assets with determinable fair value (except for loans receivable) not measured at fair value approximated their fair value mainly because of their short-term maturity. If these financial assets were measured at fair value in the financial statements, cash and restricted cash would be classified as Level 1 (where cost and fair value are aligned) and the remaining financial assets would be classified as Level 2. The estimated fair value of the loans receivable would be classified as Level 3 based on the Company’s assumptions.
As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the carrying value of the Company’s financial liabilities (except for 2026 Sustainability Notes and 2031 Notes) not measured at fair value approximated their fair value mainly because of their short-term maturity or because the effective interest rates are not materially different from market interest rates. If these financial liabilities were measured at fair value in the financial statements, these would be classified as Level 2.
As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the estimated fair value o
f the 2026 Notes would be $
351
million and $
375
million, respectively, and the estimated fair value of the 2031 Notes would be $
475
million and $
599
million, respectively, which is based on Level 2 inputs.
