During the first quarter of fiscal 2024, we revised the reporting of our geographic markets for the movement of our Middle East and Africa market units from Growth Markets to Europe, and the Europe market became our EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Africa) geographic market.

Geographic Markets
We estimate that the aggregate percentage impact of foreign currency exchange rates on our operating income during fiscal 2024 was similar to that disclosed for revenue for each geographic market. The commentary below provides insight into other factors affecting geographic market performance and operating income, including the impact of foreign currency exchange rates where significant, for fiscal 2024 compared with fiscal 2023:
•
North America operating income increased primarily due to revenue growth, lower business optimization costs and lower labor costs, partially offset by a decline in consulting contract profitability and higher acquisition-related costs.
•
EMEA operating income increased primarily due to the positive impact of foreign currency exchange rates which resulted in an increase in U.S. dollar revenues, lower labor costs and lower business optimization costs, partially offset by declines in consulting revenues in local currency and consulting contract profitability.
•
Growth Markets operating income decreased as
revenue growth in local currency and lower labor costs were more than offset by lower contract profitability and the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates which resulted in a decline in U.S. dollar revenues.
