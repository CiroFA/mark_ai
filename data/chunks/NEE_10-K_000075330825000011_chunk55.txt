increased primarily due to favorable non-qualifying hedge activity.
NEE and its subsidiaries require funds to support and grow their businesses. These funds are primarily provided by cash flows from operations, borrowings or issuances of short- and long-term debt and, from time to time, issuances of equity securities, proceeds from differential membership investors, and sales of tax credits and ownership interests in assets/businesses. See Liquidity and Capital Resources.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Net income attributable to NEE for 2024 was $6.95 billion compared to $7.31 billion in 2023. In 2024, net income attributable to NEE decreased primarily due to lower results at NEER and FPL, partly offset by higher results at Corporate and Other. The comparison of the results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 are included in Management's Discussion in NEE's and FPL's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.
NEE's effective income tax rate for 2024 and 2023 was approximately 6% and 14%, respectively. The rates for both years reflect the impact of renewable energy tax credits. See Note 5.
FPL: Results of Operations
FPL obtains its operating revenues primarily from the sale of electricity to retail customers at rates established by the FPSC through base rates and cost recovery clause mechanisms. FPL’s net income for 2024 and 2023 was $4,543 million and $4,552 million, respectively, representing a decrease of $9 million. The decrease was primarily driven by the absence of the gain on sale of FPL's ownership interest in the FCG business in 2023 and a lower earned regulatory ROE in 2024, partly offset by higher earnings from investments in plant in service and other property. Such investments grew FPL's average rate base by approximately $6.1 billion in 2024 and reflect, among other things, solar generation additions and ongoing transmission and distribution additions.
In December 2024, the FPSC approved FPL's request to begin a surcharge to recover eligible storm costs and replenish the storm reserve totaling approximately $1.2 billion for twelve months beginning in January 2025, related to Hurricanes Debby, Helene and Milton which impacted FPL's service area in 2024. During 2024, FPL completed a twelve-month interim storm restoration surcharge that began in April 2023 for eligible storm restoration costs and the replenishment of the storm reserve of approximately $1.3 billion, primarily related to Hurricanes Ian and Nicole which impacted FPL's service area in 2022. See Note 1 – Storm Funds, Storm Reserves and Storm Cost Recovery.
The use of reserve amortization is permitted by the 2021 rate agreement. See Item 1.
