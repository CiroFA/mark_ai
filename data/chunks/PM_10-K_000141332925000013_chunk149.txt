The 2024 effective tax rate increased

The change in the effective tax rate for 2024, as compared to 2023, was unfavorably impacted by: (i) an increase in deferred tax liabilities related to the fair value adjustment of equity securities held by PMI; (ii) U.S. state taxes; and (iii) a deferred tax charge for unrealized foreign currency losses on intercompany loans related to the Swedish Match acquisition financing reflected in the  consolidated statements of earnings, while the underlying pre-tax foreign currency movements fully offset in the consolidated statements of earnings and were reflected as currency translation adjustments in its consolidated statements of stockholders' (deficit) equity, partially offset by: (i) a lower deferred tax charge in 2024 related to the unremitted earnings of PMI's Russian subsidiaries as compared to the 2023 charge following the suspension of certain double tax treaties; (ii) the non-deductible Wellness and Healthcare goodwill impairment charge recorded in 2023; and (iii) a U.S. tax benefit for a worthless stock deduction under section 165(g) of the Internal Revenue Code related to PMI's investment in C.A. Tabacalera Nacional, a wholly owned foreign corporation incorporated in Venezuela.
