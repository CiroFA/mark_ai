groups generated higher revenues, primarily due to higher volumes and pricing improvements. Revenues in 2023 of the Electrical group’s building wire business and the Metal Services and Plumbing & Refrigeration groups were negatively impacted by lower metals prices, while revenues of the Transportation Products group reflected declining demand, particularly in the second half of the year.
Marmon’s pre-tax earnings increased 13.1% in 2023 compared to 2022. The earnings increase in 2023 reflected the impacts from business acquisitions ($90 million) and losses of $90 million in 2022 from the shutdown of the Rail & Leasing group business in Russia. The Rail & Leasing, Water Technologies and Plumbing & Refrigeration groups generated higher organic earnings in 2023, which were offset by lower earnings from the Electrical group’s building wire business and from the Metals Services and Medical groups.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis
Manufacturing, Service and Retailing
IMC’s revenues increased 8.0% to $4.0 billion in 2023 compared to 2022. The increase reflected the impact of business acquisitions, organic sales growth in North America and other regions and higher interest income due to higher interest rates, partially offset by lower revenues in the Asia-Pacific region, unfavorable foreign currency translation from a stronger U.S. Dollar and the impact of ongoing geopolitical conflicts. IMC’s pre-tax earnings increased 6.9% in 2023 compared to 2022, primarily attributable to higher interest income. The impact of the revenue increase was largely offset by higher raw material costs, changes in sales mix and the adverse effects of geopolitical conflicts.
Building products
The building products group includes manufactured and site-built home construction and related lending and financial services (Clayton Homes), flooring (Shaw), insulation, roofing and engineered products (Johns Manville), bricks and masonry products (Acme Building Brands), paint and coatings (Benjamin Moore) and residential and commercial construction and engineering products and systems (MiTek).
2024 versus 2023
Revenues of the building products group increased $560 million (2.2%) in 2024 compared to 2023. Pre-tax earnings decreased $53 million (1.3%) in 2024 compared to 2023.
Clayton Homes’ revenues increased 8.5% in 2024 to $12.4 billion compared to 2023. Revenues from home sales increased $565 million (6.4%) in 2024, reflecting higher new home unit sales of 11.5%, partially offset by changes in sales mix and lower average selling prices. Also, financial services revenues increased 15.5% in 2024 compared to 2023, primarily due to increased interest income from higher average loan balances. Loan balances, net of allowances for credit losses, were approximately $27.2 billion as of December 31, 2024, an increase of 14.0% since December 31, 2023. Loan portfolio balances are largely funded by borrowings from Berkshire finance affiliates.
