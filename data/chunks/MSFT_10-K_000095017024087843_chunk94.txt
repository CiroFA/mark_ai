consideration, optional purchases, and free services).
•
Determination of stand-alone selling prices for each distinct performance obligation and for products and services that are not sold separately.
Given these factors and due to the volume of transactions, the related audit effort in evaluating management's judgments in determining revenue recognition for certain customer agreements was extensive and required a high degree of auditor judgment.
How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit
Our principal audit procedures related to the Company's revenue recognition for certain customer agreements included the following:
•
We tested the effectiveness of controls related to the identification of distinct performance obligations, the determination of the timing of revenue recognition, and the estimation of variable consideration.
•
We evaluated management's significant accounting policies related to certain customer agreements for reasonableness.
•
We selected a sample of customer agreements and performed the following procedures:
-
Obtained and read contract source documents for each selection, including master agreements, and other documents that were part of the agreement.
-
Tested management's identification and treatment of contract terms.
-
Assessed the terms in the customer agreement and evaluated the appropriateness of management's application of their accounting policies, along with their use of estimates, in the determination of revenue recognition conclusions.
•
We evaluated the reasonableness of management's estimate of stand-alone selling prices for products and services that are not sold separately.
•
We tested the mathematical accuracy of management's calculations of revenue and the associated timing of revenue recognized in the financial statements.
