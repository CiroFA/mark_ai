Interest Income and Expense
Our interest income was $2.9 billion and $4.7 billion during 2023 and 2024, primarily due to a higher average balance of invested funds at prevailing rates.

Our interest income corresponds with the average balance of invested funds based on the prevailing rates, which vary depending on the geographies and currencies in which they are invested.
