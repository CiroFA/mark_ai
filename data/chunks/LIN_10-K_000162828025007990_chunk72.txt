agreements. Linde’s participation in these plans is not material either at the plan level or in the aggregate. For all MEPs, Linde’s contributions were less than
1
% of the total contributions to each plan for
2024,
2023
and
2022
.
Linde has obtained the most recently available Pension Protection Act ("PPA") annual funding notices from the Trustees of the MEPs.
As of
December 31, 2024
, there were
four
Red Zone plans, deemed
to be in "critical" or "critical and declining" status that
have implemented financial improvement or rehabilitation plans. Linde does not currently anticipate significant future obligations due to the funding status of these plans and any such obligation would be immaterial. If Li
nde determined it was probable that it would withdraw from an MEP, the company would record a liability for its portion of the MEP’s unfunded pension obligations, as calculated at that time. Historically, such withdrawal payments have not been significant.
Defined Contribution Plans
Linde’s U.S. employees are eligible to participate in defined contribution savings plans offered by their applicable business. Employee contribution percentages vary by plan and are subject to the maximum allowable by IRS regulations. The cost for these defined contribution plans was $
69
million in
2024
, $
59
million in
2023
and $
56
million in
2022
(these costs are not included in the tables that follow).
The defined contribution plans include a non-leveraged employee stock ownership plan ("ESOP") which covers all employees participating in this plan. The collective number of shares of Linde ordinary shares in the ESOP totaled
1,578,863
at
December 31, 2024
.
Certain non-U.S. subsidiaries of the company also sponsor defined contribution plans where contributions are determined under various formulas. The expense for these plans was $
62
million in
2024
, $
60
million in
2023
and $
80
million in
2022
(these expenses are not included in the tables that follow).
Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions (OPEB)
Linde provides health care and life insurance benefits to certain eligible retired employees. These benefits are provided through various insurance companies and healthcare providers. The company does not currently fund its postretirement benefits obligations. Linde’s retiree plans may be changed or terminated by Linde at any time for any reason with no liability to current or future retirees.
Linde uses a measurement date of December 31 for its pension and other post-retirement benefit plans.
