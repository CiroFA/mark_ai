However, models are subject to inherent limitations from simplifying assumptions, uncertainty regarding economic and financial outcomes, and emerging risks, including from applications that rely on AI.
Our models may not be sufficiently predictive of future results, such as due to limited historical patterns, extreme or unanticipated market movements or clientsâ€™ behavior and liquidity, especially during severe market downturns or stress events (e.g., geopolitical or pandemic events), which could limit their effectiveness and require timely recalibration. The models that we use to assess and control our market risk exposures also reflect assumptions about the degree of correlation among prices of various asset classes or other market indicators, which may not be representative of the next downturn and would magnify the limitations inherent in using historical data to
manage risk. Market conditions in recent years have involved unprecedented dislocations and highlight the limitations inherent in using historical data to manage risk. Our models may also be adversely impacted by human error and may not be effective if we fail to properly oversee, regularly review and detect their flaws during our review and monitoring processes, they contain biases, erroneous data, assumptions, valuations, formulas or algorithms, or our applications running the models do not perform as expected. Regardless of the steps we take to design effective controls, governance, monitoring and testing, and implement new technology and automated processes, we could suffer operational, reputational and financial harm, including funding or liquidity shortfalls, and adverse business decisions and regulatory risk if models fail to properly anticipate and manage risks.
Failure to properly manage data may adversely affect our ability to manage compliance risk and business needs, and result in errors in our operations, reporting and decision-making, and non-compliance with LRRs.
We rely on our ability to manage and process data accurately, timely and completely, including capturing, transporting, aggregating, using, transmitting data externally, and retaining and protecting data appropriately. While we continually update our policies, programs, processes and practices and take steps to leverage emerging technologies, such as automation, AI and robotics, our data management processes may not be effective and are subject to weaknesses and failures, including human error, data limitations, process delays, system failure or failed controls. Failure to effectively manage data accurately, timely and completely may adversely impact its quality and reliability and our ability to manage current and emerging risks, produce accurate financial, nonfinancial, regulatory, operational, environmental and social reporting, detect or surveil potential misconduct or non-compliance with LRRs, and to manage our business needs, strategic decision-making, resolution strategy and operations.
