also caused and may continue to cause disruption and instability in global markets, supply chains and industries that negatively impact our
businesses, results of operations, cash flows, financial condition, and pose reputational risks. In addition, our customers and suppliers
could be affected directly by an economic downturn and some could face credit issues or cash flow problems that could give rise to
payment delays, increased credit risk, bankruptcies, and other financial hardships, which could adversely impact customer demand for our
products as well as our ability to manage normal commercial relationships with our customers and suppliers. Depending on their severity
and duration, the effects and consequences of global economic and political conditions could have an adverse impact on our results of
operations, cash flows, and financial condition.
Unexpected events, such as natural disasters, geopolitical conflicts, pandemics, and other events beyond our control, may
increase our cost of doing business or disrupt our operations.
The occurrence of one or more unexpected events, including
geopolitical conflicts (such as the Russia-Ukraine conflict and the conflicts in the Middle East), acts of terrorism or violence, civil unrest,
fires, tornadoes, tsunamis, hurricanes, earthquakes, floods and other forms of severe weather in regions in which we operate or in which
our suppliers are located could adversely affect our operations and financial performance. Natural disasters, product failures, power
outages or other unexpected events could result in physical damage to and complete or partial closure of one or more of our manufacturing
facilities or distribution centers, temporary or long-term disruption in the supply of component products from local and international
suppliers, and disruption and delay in the transport of our products to project sites and distribution centers. A public health epidemic or
pandemic poses the risk that our employees, contractors, suppliers, customers, and other business partners may be prevented from
conducting business activities for an indefinite period of time, including due to shutdowns, travel restrictions, or other actions that may be
requested or mandated by governmental authorities, or that such epidemic or pandemic may otherwise interrupt or impair business
activities. Our operations and financial performance were negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic that caused a slowdown of
economic activity, disruptions in global supply chains, and significant volatility and disruption of financial markets. Existing insurance
coverage may not provide protection for all the costs that may arise from such events, and any incidents may result in loss of, or increased
costs of, such insurance. In addition, while we have disaster recovery and business continuity plans (including those relating to our
information technology systems), they may not be fully responsive to, or capable of eliminating or materially minimizing
