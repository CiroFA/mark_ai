We are exposed to risks associated with business combinations, acquisitions, strategic investments and divestitures.
We may engage in acquisitions of or investments in companies, technologies or products in existing, related or new markets. Business combinations, acquisitions and investments involve numerous risks to our business, financial condition and operating results, including:
•
inability to complete proposed transactions timely or at all due to the failure to obtain regulatory or other approvals, including through expanding global national security regimes that impose prohibitions on foreign investments in or acquisitions of local businesses; litigation or other disputes, and any ensuing obligation to pay a termination fee;
•
diversion of management’s attention and disruption of ongoing businesses;
•
the failure to realize expected revenues, gross and operating margins, net income and other returns from acquired businesses;
•
requirements imposed by government regulators in connection with their review of a transaction, which may include, among other things, divestitures and restrictions on the conduct of our existing business or the acquired business;
•
following completion of acquisitions, ineffective integration of businesses, operations, systems, digital and physical security, technologies, products, employees, compliance programs, changes in laws or regulations, including tax laws, or other factors, may impact the ability to realize anticipated synergies or other benefits;
•
failure to commercialize technologies from acquired businesses or developed through strategic investments;
•
dependence on unfamiliar supply chains or relatively small supply partners;
•
inability to capitalize on characteristics of new markets that may be significantly different from our existing markets and where competitors may have stronger market positions and customer relationships;
