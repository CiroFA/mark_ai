were selected by the Department of Health and Human Services for “negotiation” in 2026 or 2027, there is no assurance that our products will not be selected in the future. We continue to evaluate the potential impact of the IRA on our business. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) has issued a number of guidance documents and regulations governing certain aspects of the IRA, but it remains unclear how certain provisions of the IRA will be implemented. Additional guidance, legislation or rulemaking may be issued that could change the scope or implementation of the IRA. In addition, multiple manufacturers and trade organizations have challenged the Medicare “negotiation” provisions of the IRA, and additional legal challenges may be filed in the future. While the full impact of the IRA on our business and the pharmaceutical industry remains uncertain at this time, we anticipate that the IRA will increase our payment obligations under the redesigned Part D discount program, limit the prices we can charge for our products, and increase the rebates we must provide government programs for our products, thereby reducing our profitability and negatively impacting our financial results.

These initiatives and such other legislation may cause added pricing pressures on our products, and the resulting impact on our business is uncertain at this time.

The outcome of these reviews cannot be predicted and could have an adverse effect on the pricing and reimbursement of our medical products in the EU member states. Reductions in the pricing of our medical products in one member state could affect the price in other member states and have a negative impact on our financial results.

The current U.S. Presidential administration has indicated that it plans to pursue additional policies aimed at lowering prescription drug costs. For example, it recently issued an executive order that, among other things, directs specified agency heads to: (1) develop a Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation model that enables the Medicare program to obtain better value for high-cost prescription drugs and biological products; (2) make it easier for States to import drugs from Canada; (3)
