Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
Manufacturing, Service and Retailing
Revenues of the industrial products group were $9.1 billion in the first quarter of 2025, an increase of $174 million (2.0%) compared to the first quarter of 2024. Pre-tax earnings in 2025 increased $24 million (1.5%) compared to 2024. Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues for the group were 17.5% for the first quarter of 2025, unchanged from 2024.
PCC’s revenues were $2.7 billion in the first quarter of 2025, an increase of 8.8% compared to the first quarter of 2024, primarily attributable to higher demand for aerospace products. PCC’s pre-tax earnings increased 40.7% in the first quarter of 2025 compared to the first quarter of 2024. The improved results reflect sales increases and improved manufacturing and operating efficiencies, partly offset by charges and expenses associated with a fire at a fasteners facility in the first quarter of 2025.
Lubrizol’s revenues were $1.6 billion in the first quarter of 2025, a decrease of 4.7% compared to 2024. The decline was attributable to lower volumes and selling prices, partially offset by favorable product mix. Lubrizol’s pre-tax earnings declined 25.8% in the first quarter of 2025 compared to 2024. The decrease was primarily attributable to restructuring charges in 2025 and lower volumes and selling prices, partially offset by lower raw material costs.
Marmon’s revenues were $3.1 billion in the first quarter of 2025, an increase of 3.4% compared to 2024. Seven of the twelve business groups generated higher revenues led by the Rail & Leasing group
