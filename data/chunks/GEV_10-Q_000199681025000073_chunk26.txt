Wind, to support fulfillment and deliveries expected in the second half of 2024; accounts payable and
equipment project payables of $(0.7) billion due to higher disbursements than volume across all businesses, and settlements of payables
with GE in preparation for the Spin-Off; and current contract assets of $(0.3) billion driven by revenue recognition exceeding billings,
primarily in our Offshore Wind business at Wind; partially offset by contract liabilities and current deferred income of $0.9 billion as a result
of down payments and collections on several large projects in Onshore Wind at Wind, Gas Power at Power and Grid Solutions at
Electrification; and current receivables of $0.3 billion, driven by benefits arising from the
IRA
related to advanced manufacturing credits of
$0.2 billion, and collections outpacing billings, primarily in Power.
Cash from (used for) investing activities
was
$(0.1) billion
and
$(0.3) billion
for the
three months ended
March 31, 2025
and
2024
,
respectively.
Cash used for investing activities decreased by
$0.2 billion
in
2025
compared to
2024
primarily
driven by: lower purchases of and
contributions to equity method investments of $0.1 billion, primarily in our Financial Services business; and higher sales of and distributions
from equity method investments of $0.1 billion, driven by the sale of an approximately
2%
equity interest in China XD Electric Co., Ltd. in
the first quarter of 2025. Cash used for additions to PP&E and internal-use software, which is a component of free cash flow*, was $0.2
billion for both the
three months ended
March 31, 2025
and
2024
.
Cash from (used for) financing activities
was
$(1.3) billion
and
$1.9 billion
for the
three months ended
March 31, 2025
and
2024
,
respectively. Cash used for financing activities increased by $3.2 billion in 2025 compared to 2024 primarily driven by:
the nonrecurrence of
transfers from parent of $2.0 billion; and cash settlements for share repurchases of
$1.1 billion
in the first quarter of 2025.
