Level 3 inputs primarily consist of investments in privately-held entities. Fair values of these securities are estimated using a variety of valuation methodologies, including both the market and income approaches. The Company uses valuation techniques appropriate for the type of investment and the information available about the investee as of the valuation date to determine fair value. Recent financing transactions in the investee are generally considered the best indication of the enterprise value and therefore used as a basis to estimate fair value. However, based on a number of factors, such as the proximity in timing to the valuation date or the volume or other terms of these financing transactions, the Company may also use other valuation techniques to supplement this data, including the income approach. When a financing transaction occurs and represents fair value, the Company also uses the calibration process, as appropriate, when estimating fair value on subsequent measurement dates. Calibration is the process of using observed transactions in the investee company's own instruments to ensure that the valuation techniques that will be employed to value the investee company investment on subsequent measurement dates begin with assumptions that are consistent with the original observed transaction as well as any more recent observed transactions in the instruments issued by the investee company.
As of June 30, 2023 and 2022, the Company evaluated its investment in Yanolja for impairment using a combination of the market approach and the income approach in estimating the fair value of the investment as of those dates, and recognized impairment charges. The market approach estimates value using prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving comparable companies. The income approach estimates value based on the expectation of future cash flows that a company will generate. These future cash flows are discounted to their present values using a discount rate based on a company's weighted-average cost of capital adjusted to reflect the risks inherent in its cash flows. The key unobservable inputs and ranges used for the June 2023 impairment evaluation, primarily using the income approach, include the weighted average cost of capital (
10.5
%-
14.5
%) and the terminal EBITDA multiple (
14
x-
16
x). The key unobservable inputs and ranges used for the June 2022 impairment evaluation include, for the market approach, percentage decrease in the calibrated EBITDA multiple (
36
%) and for the income approach, the weighted average cost of capital (
10
%-
14
%) and the terminal EBITDA multiple (
14
x-
16
x). Significant changes in any of these inputs in isolation would result in significantly different fair value measurements. A change in the assumption used for EBITDA multiples would result in a directionally similar change in the fair value, and a change in the assumption used for weighted average cost of capital would
