cost-reduction measures taken by governments and other third parties to lower health care costs. The Company anticipates all of these actions and additional actions in the future will continue to negatively affect sales and profits.
Operating Results
Sales
Worldwide sales were $64.2 billion in 2024, representing growth of 7% compared with 2023, or 10% excluding the unfavorable effect of foreign exchange. The devaluation of the Argentine peso contributed approximately 2 percentage points of the negative impact of foreign exchange, which was largely offset by inflation-related price increases consistent with practice in that market. Global sales growth was primarily due to higher sales in the oncology franchise, largely due to strong growth of
Keytruda
and
Welireg
, as well as increased alliance revenue from Reblozyl and Lynparza. Also contributing to revenue growth were higher sales in the cardiovascular

s
franchise, largely attributable to the launch of
Winrevair
, higher sales of certain hospital acute care products, particularly
Prevymis
, as well as higher sales of animal health products. Sales growth in 2024 was partially offset by lower sales in the diabetes franchise, due to
Januvia
and
Janumet
, and lower sales in the virology franchise largely attributable to
Lagevrio
. Lower sales in the immunology franchise due to the return of the marketing rights for
Remicade
and
Simponi
in former Merck territories to Johnson & Johnson on October 1, 2024,
and lower sales in the vaccines franchise primarily due to
Gardasil/Gardasil 9
also offset sales growth in 2024.
