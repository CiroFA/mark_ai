administers a number of equity compensation plans, with awards being granted predominantly from the Bank of America Corporation Equity Plan (BACEP). Under this plan,
890
million shares of the Corporation’s common stock are authorized to be used for grants of awards.
During 2024 and 2023, the Corporation granted
121
million and
115
million RSUs to certain employees under the BACEP. These RSUs were authorized to settle predominantly in shares of common stock of the Corporation. Certain RSUs will be settled in cash or contain settlement provisions that subject these awards to variable accounting whereby compensation expense is adjusted to fair value based on changes in the share price of the Corporation’s common stock up to the settlement date. The RSUs granted in 2024 and 2023 predominantly vest over
four years
in one-fourth increments on each of the first four anniversaries of the grant date, provided that the employee remains continuously employed with the Corporation during that time, and will be expensed ratably over the vesting period, net of estimated forfeitures, for non-retirement eligible employees based on the grant-date fair value of the shares. Of the RSUs granted in 2024 and 2023,
42
million in each year do not include retirement eligibility. For all other RSUs granted to employees who are retirement eligible, they are deemed authorized as of the beginning of the year preceding the grant date when the incentive award plans are generally approved. As a result, the estimated value is expensed ratably over the year preceding the grant date. The compensation cost for the stock-based plans was $
3.6
billion, $
3.1
billion and $
2.9
billion, and the related income tax benefit was $
872
million, $
733
million and $
697
million for 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. At December 31, 2024, there was an estimated $
4.3
billion of total unrecognized compensation cost related to certain share-based compensation awards that is expected to be recognized generally over a period of up to
four years
, with a weighted-average period of
2.4
years.
Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units
The total fair value of restricted stock and restricted stock units vested in 2024, 2023 and 2022 was $
2.6
billion, $
2.6
billion and $
3.4
billion, respectively.

Income Taxes
The components of income tax expense for 2024, 2023 and 2022 are presented in the table below.
Total income tax expense does not reflect the tax effects of items that are included in OCI each period. For more information, see
Note 14 – Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)
. Other tax effects included in OCI each period resulted in an expense of $
1.5
billion and $
892
million in 2024 and 2023 and a benefit of $
4.9
billion in 2022. The increase in the federal deferred tax benefit in 2024 and 2023 was primarily driven by increased tax
