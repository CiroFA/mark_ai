issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2024-03
(Subtopic 220-40):
Income Statement - Reporting
Comprehensive Income - Expense Disaggregation Disclosures
which requires disaggregation of certain expense captions into
specified categories in disclosures within the Notes to the
Consolidated Financial Statements. The new disclosure
requirements are effective for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2026 and interim periods within fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2027. Early adoption is permitted.
We are currently evaluating these new expanded disclosure
requirements.
In December 2023 the FASB issued ASU 2023-09 (Topic 740):
Income Taxes: Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures
which
expands the existing rules on income tax disclosures. This
update requires entities to disclose specific categories in the tax
rate reconciliation, provide additional information for reconciling
items that meet a quantitative threshold and disclose additional
information about income taxes paid on an annual basis. The
new disclosure requirements are effective for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2024 and
we will adopt this ASU in
the fourth quarter 2025
.
We evaluate all ASUs issued by the FASB for consideration of
their applicability. ASUs not included in our disclosures were
assessed and determined to be either not applicable or are not
expected to have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial
Statements.
NOTE 2 -
REVENUE RECOGNITION
Our policies for recognizing sales have not changed from those
described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for
2024
.
We disaggregate our net sales by business and geographic
location for each of our segments as we believe it best depicts
how the nature, amount, timing and certainty of our net sales and
cash flows are affected by economic factors.
In the first quarter
2025
we changed the name of our
Neurovascular business to Vascular due the acquisition of Inari
Medical, Inc. (Inari).
In the fourth quarter
2024
we reorganized our Spine business to
align with certain updates to our internal reporting structure. The
spine enabling technologies portfolio (Enabling Technologies)
was reclassified to Other Orthopaedics and Spine, the
interventional spine (IVS) portfolio was reclassified to Neuro
Cranial
and the remaining Spine business was renamed to Spinal
Implants
. In addition we changed the name of our “Orthopaedics
and Spine” operating segment to “Orthopaedics.”
Neuro Cranial
includes sales related to
IVS
of
$
118
and
$
98
for the
three
months
2025
and
2024
. Other Orthopaedics includes sales
related to Enabling Technologies of
$
29
and
$
31
for the
three
months
2025
and
2024
. We have reflected these changes in all
historical periods presented.
Costs to Obtain or Fulfill a Contract
We typically do not incur costs to fulfill a contract before a
product or service is provided to a customer due to the nature of
our products and services. Our costs to obtain contracts are
typically in the form of sales commissions
