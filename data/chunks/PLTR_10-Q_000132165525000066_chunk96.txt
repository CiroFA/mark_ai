payment cycles, greater difficulty in enforcing contracts, difficulties in collecting accounts receivable, especially in emerging markets, and the likelihood that revenue from non-U.S. system integrators, government contractors, and customers may need to be recognized when cash is received, at least until satisfactory payment history has been established, or upon confirmation of certain acceptance criteria or milestones;
•
the need to adapt our platforms for non-U.S. customers whether to accommodate customer preferences or local law;
•
changes to U.S. laws, regulations, or government enforcement practices which could impact the countries we operate in and, as a result, affect our ability to legally work in those countries or with their governments;
•
differing regulatory and legal requirements and possible enactment of additional regulations or restrictions on the use, import, or re-export of our platforms or the provision of services, which could delay, restrict, or prevent the sale or use of our platforms and services in some jurisdictions;
•
compliance with multiple and changing foreign laws and regulations, including those governing employment, privacy, data protection, information security, data transfer, AI, and the risks and costs of non-compliance with such laws and regulations;
•
new and different sources of competition not present in the United States;
•
heightened risks of unfair or corrupt business practices in certain geographies and of improper or fraudulent sales arrangements that may cause us to withdraw from particular markets, or impact financial results and result in restatements of financial statements and irregularities in financial statements;
•
volatility in non-U.S. political and economic environments, including by way of examples, the potential effects of the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict, as well as economic sanctions the United States and other countries have imposed on Russia, the conflict resulting from Hamas’ attack on Israel, and the ongoing conflict in the Middle East;
•
weaker protection of intellectual property rights in some countries and the risk of potential theft, copying, or other compromises of our technology, data, or intellectual property in connection with our non-U.S. operations, whether by state-sponsored malfeasance or other foreign entities or individuals;
•
volatility and fluctuations in currency exchange rates, including that, because many of our non-U.S. contracts are denominated in U.S. dollars, an increase in the strength of the U.S. dollar in the past has made our products more expensive for non-U.S. dollar denominated customers, which may make doing business with us less appealing to such customers;
•
management and employee communication and integration problems resulting from language differences, cultural differences, and geographic dispersion;
•
difficulties in repatriating or transferring funds from, or converting currencies in, certain countries;
