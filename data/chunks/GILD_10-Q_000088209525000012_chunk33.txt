repurchasing shares to offset dilution and opportunistically reduce share count. Based on our evaluation of our current position of liquidity, available capital resources and our material cash requirements, we believe that we can satisfy our capital needs for the next 12 months and the foreseeable future.
Liquidity
Cash and cash equivalents were $7.9 billion as of March 31, 2025. The table below summarizes our cash flow activities, followed by our analysis of changes and trends:
Operating Activities
Net cash provided by operating activities is our primary source of funds, driven mainly by collections on product sales, partially offset by operating spend. Changes in working capital balances, generally associated with the timing of collections and payments, as well as unanticipated payments related to litigation, taxes or other matters, may create some variation in any given year. Net cash provided by operating activities decreased for the three months ended March 31, 2025, compared to the same period in 2024, primarily due to higher income tax payments and inventory purchases.
In April 2025, we made our final $1.3 billion federal income tax payment for transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of foreign earnings related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.
Investing Activities
Net cash used in investing activities decreased for the three months ended March 31, 2025, compared to the same period in 2024, primarily due to the $3.9 billion net cash payment for the CymaBay acquisition during the three months ended March 31, 2024, partially offset by proceeds from the liquidation of marketable debt securities to fund that acquisition, with no such activity during the three months ended March 31, 2025. The decrease was also due to fewer equity security purchases during the three months ended March 31, 2025. Net cash used in investing activities may vary in any given year depending on the favorability of strategic opportunities for the business.
Financing Activities
Net cash used in financing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2025 was primarily the result of $1.76 billion for debt repayments, $1.0 billion for dividend payments and $730 million for common stock repurchases. During the three months ended March 31, 2024, we utilized cash of $990 million for dividend payments and $400 million for common stock repurchases. The year-over-year changes were due mostly to higher cash used by debt repayments and share repurchases. Net cash used in financing activities may vary in any given year depending primarily on the timing of debt repayments and proceeds from debt offerings and the amount of common stock repurchases.
On April 24, 2025, we announced that our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.79 per share of our common stock, with a payment date of June 27, 2025 to all stockholders of record as of the close of business on June 13, 2025. Future dividends are subject to declaration by our Board of Directors.
