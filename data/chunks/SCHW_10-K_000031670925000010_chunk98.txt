cash from sweep products to higher-yielding investment solutions further decelerated in 2024, particularly in the second half of the year. Bank sweep deposits and payables to brokerage clients increased by a total of $9.8 billion, or 4%, during the third quarter, and $30.1 billion, or 11%, in the fourth quarter of 2024, inclusive of typical seasonal cash inflows near year-end. Deceleration of client cash reallocation activity, along with principal and interest payments on the AFS and HTM securities portfolios, supported a reduction in bank supplemental funding of $14.9 billion, or 23%, during the fourth quarter and $29.7 billion, or 37%, for the full year ended December 31, 2024.
Schwab’s average interest-earning assets in 2023 were lower compared with 2022, primarily due to clients’ reallocation of cash from sweep products to higher-yielding investment solutions in the second half of 2022 and during 2023, which resulted primarily from the rapid increases to the federal funds overnight rate. These changes in client cash allocations reduced average balances of bank deposits and payables to brokerage clients. To support this client cash allocation activity, the Company utilized bank supplemental funding beginning in the fourth quarter of 2022 and throughout 2023, including drawing upon FHLB secured lending facilities, engaging with external financial institutions in repurchase agreements at its banking subsidiaries, and issuing brokered CDs. The average pace of client cash allocation out of sweep products into higher-yielding investment solutions decreased significantly beginning in the second quarter of 2023, and, apart from an increase in August following the Federal Reserve’s July rate increase, continued to decline during the second half of 2023. In the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company saw bank deposits and payables to brokerage clients increase by a total of $17.5 billion, or 5%, due in part to typical seasonal cash inflows near year-end.
