revenues of $19.8 billion increased 6%, driven by a 26% increase in Equity Markets and a 1% increase in Fixed Income Markets. The increase in Equity Markets was primarily driven by growth in cash equities, due to higher client activity and volumes, and equity derivatives on higher volatility, which also included the impact from an episodic gain related to the Visa B exchange. The increase was also driven by an increase in prime services. The increase in Fixed Income Markets was driven by growth in spread products and other fixed income (up 20%), partially offset by lower revenues in rates and currencies (down 6%). The increase in spread products and other fixed income revenues was largely driven by increased client activity due to growth in asset-backed financing, securitization activity and underwriting fees, partially offset by a decline in commodities revenues. The decline in rates and currencies revenues was primarily due to lower volatility and a strong prior-year performance, partially offset by the smaller impact of the Argentina currency devaluation.
Markets
