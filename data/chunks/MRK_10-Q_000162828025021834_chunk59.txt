Animal Health Segment
Sales of livestock products grew 9% in the first quarter of 2025 primarily due to higher demand across all species, a benefit from the timing of ruminant product sales, as well as the inclusion of sales from the July 2024 acquisition of the aqua business of Elanco Animal Health Incorporated.
Sales of companion animal products were essentially flat in the first quarter of 2025. Sales of the
Bravecto
(fluralaner) line of products were $327 million for the first quarter of 2025, representing a decline of 1% compared with the corresponding prior year period, or growth of 2% excluding the unfavorable effect of foreign exchange.
