increased by 7.7%. Net revenues, excluding currency and acquisitions, increased by 10.1%, mainly reflecting: a favorable pricing variance, primarily driven by higher combustible tobacco pricing; favorable volume/mix, driven by higher smoke-free products volume, partly offset by unfavorable cigarette mix; and a favorable comparison to 2023 reflecting a charge in the first quarter of 2023 of $80 million (recognized as a reduction of net revenues in 2023) following the termination of a distribution arrangement in the Middle East, shown in "Other."
The unfavorable currency impact in net revenues was due primarily to the Egyptian pound, Indonesian rupiah, Japanese yen and Russian ruble.
Net revenues include $14.7 billion in 2024 and $12.8 billion in 2023 related to smoke-free.
Operating income increased by 16.0%. Operating income, excluding currency and acquisitions, increased by 21.5%, mainly reflecting: the same factors as for net revenues, as well as a favorable comparison to 2023 reflecting the impairment of goodwill of $665 million recorded in the second quarter of 2023, the South Korea indirect tax charge of $204 million in 2023, the termination of a pledge agreement with the Foundation for a Smoke-Free World of $140 million and $53 million related to the war in Ukraine. The increase was partly offset by higher amortization of intangibles in 2024, higher restructuring charges in 2024, a charge of $199 million related to the loss on sale of Vectura Group and the Egypt sales tax charge of $45 million in 2024, as well as higher marketing, administration and research costs (primarily due to inflationary impacts, notably related to wages, and higher commercial investments), as well as higher manufacturing costs, notably related to tobacco leaf and the impact of the EU single-use plastics directive, partly offset by productivity.
Amortization expense on a pre-tax basis for each of the next five years is estimated to be approximately $1.0 billion or less, assuming no additional transactions occur that require the amortization of intangible assets. This amount includes the reacquired rights recorded as other intangible assets, net, in May 2024 following the reacquisition of

Interest expense, net, of $1.1 billion increased by $82 million (7.7%), primarily due to higher average debt levels and higher average interest rates on debt, partially offset by higher interest income.
