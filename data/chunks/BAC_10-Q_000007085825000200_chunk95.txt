executive officers, the Corporation must meet risk-based capital ratio requirements that include a capital conservation buffer of 2.5 percent (under the Advanced approaches only), an SCB (under the Standardized approach only), plus any applicable countercyclical capital buffer and a global systemically important bank (G-SIB) surcharge. The buffers and surcharge must be comprised solely of CET1 capital. For the period from October 1, 2024 through September 30, 2025, the Corporation’s minimum CET1 requirements are 10.7 percent under the Standardized approach and 10.0 percent under the Advanced approaches.
The Corporation is required to calculate its G-SIB surcharge on an annual basis under two methods and is subject to the higher of the resulting two surcharges. Method 1 is consistent with the approach prescribed by the Basel Committee’s assessment methodology and is calculated using specified indicators of systemic importance. Method 2 modifies the Method 1 approach by, among other factors, including a measure of the Corporation’s reliance on short-term wholesale funding. The Corporation’s G-SIB surcharge, which is higher under Method 2, is expected to increase to 3.5 percent from 3.0 percent on January 1, 2027, unless its surcharge calculated as of December 31, 2025 is lower than 3.5 percent. At March 31, 2025, the Corporation’s CET1 capital ratio of 11.8 percent under the Standardized approach exceeded its CET1 capital ratio requirement.
The Corporation is also required to maintain a minimum supplementary leverage ratio (SLR) of 3.0 percent plus a leverage buffer of 2.0 percent in order to avoid certain restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments to executive officers. At March 31, 2025, our insured depository institution subsidiaries exceeded their requirement to maintain a minimum 6.0 percent SLR to be considered well capitalized under the PCA framework.
Capital Composition and Ratios
Table 7 presents Bank of America Corporation’s capital ratios and related information in accordance with Basel 3 Standardized and Advanced approaches as measured at March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024. For the periods presented herein, the Corporation met the definition of well capitalized under current regulatory requirements.
(1)
Capital ratios as of December 31, 2024 were calculated using the regulatory capital rule that allowed a five-year transition period related to the adoption of the current expected credit losses (CECL) accounting standard on January 1, 2020.
(2)
The CET1 capital regulatory minimum is the sum of the CET1 capital ratio minimum of 4.5 percent, our G-SIB surcharge of 3.0 percent, and SCB (under the Standardized approach) of 3.2 percent. The countercyclical capital buffer was zero for both periods. The SLR regulatory minimum includes a leverage buffer of 2.0 percent.
(3)
Total capital under the Advanced approaches differs from the Standardized approach due to differences in the amount permitted in Tier 2 capital
