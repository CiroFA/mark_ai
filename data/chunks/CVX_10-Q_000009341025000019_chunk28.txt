Results of Operations
Business Segments
The following section presents the results of operations and variances on an after-tax basis for the company’s business segments — Upstream and Downstream — as well as for “All Other.” (Refer to
Note 7 Operating Segments and Geographic Data
for a discussion of the company’s “reportable segments,” as defined under the accounting standards for segment reporting.)
Upstream
Three Month Periods Ended March 31, 2025 and 2024
U.S. upstream earnings decreased by $217 million primarily due to higher operating expenses of $280 million, including a legal reserve of $130 million, and lower liquids realizations of $110 million, partly offset by higher natural gas realizations of $240 million.
Net oil-equivalent production was up 63,000 barrels per day, or 4 percent. The increase was primarily due to higher production in the Permian Basin and Gulf of America, partly offset by lower production in the Rockies.
Three Month Periods Ended March 31, 2025 and 2024
International upstream earnings decreased by $1.3 billion primarily due to lower liftings of $430 million mainly due to asset sales, lower affiliate earnings of $365 million at TCO primarily due to higher depreciation, depletion and amortization partly offset by higher production following FGP start-up, lower realizations of $280 million, and an unfavorable swing in tax items of $210 million, partly offset by lower operating expenses of $150 million, mainly from asset sales. Foreign currency effects had an unfavorable impact on earnings of $158 million between periods.
