realized on settlement. A liability is established for differences between positions taken in a tax return and amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements.
The accrued liability for interest expense related to income tax matters and income tax penalties was $
475
million as of December 2024 and $
320
million as of December 2023. The firm recognized interest expense and income tax penalties of $
113
million for 2024, $
90
million for 2023 and $
59
million for 2022. It is reasonably possible that unrecognized tax benefits could change significantly during the twelve months subsequent to December 2024 due to potential audit settlements. However, at this time it is not possible to estimate any potential change.
The table below presents the changes in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits, which is included in other liabilities.
In the table above, the liability for unrecognized tax benefits included $
1.8
billion as of December 2024, $
1.4
billion as of December 2023 and $
1.2
billion as of December 2022 of unrecognized tax benefits which, if recognized, would reduce the annual effective tax rate. The remaining unrecognized tax benefits in the table above would not affect the annual tax rate, as such benefits have jurisdictional offsets or relate to temporary differences.
Regulatory Tax Examinations
The firm is subject to examination by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other taxing authorities in jurisdictions where the firm has significant business operations, such as the United Kingdom, Japan, Hong Kong and various states, such as New York. The tax years under examination vary by jurisdiction. The firm does not expect completion of these audits to have a material impact on the firmâ€™s financial condition, but it may be material to operating results for a particular period, depending, in part, on the operating results for that period.
The table below presents the earliest tax years that remain subject to examination by major jurisdiction.
The firm has been accepted into the Compliance Assurance Process (CAP) program by the IRS for each of the tax years from 2013 through 2025. This program allows the firm to work with the IRS to identify and resolve potential U.S. Federal tax issues before the filing of tax returns. All issues addressed through the CAP program for the 2011 through 2018 tax years have been resolved and completion is pending final review by the Joint Committee on Taxation. All issues for the 2019 through 2022 tax years have been resolved and will be effectively settled pending administrative completion by the IRS. Final completion of tax years 2011 through 2022 will not have a material impact on the effective tax rate. The 2023 tax year remains subject to post-filing review. New York State and City examinations of tax years 2015 through 2018 commenced during 2021.
All years, including and subsequent to the years in the table above, remain open to examination by the taxing authorities. The firm believes
