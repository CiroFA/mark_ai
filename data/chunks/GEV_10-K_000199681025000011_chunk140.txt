will exceed amounts accrued. However, due to uncertainties about the status of laws,
regulations, technology, and information related to individual sites and lawsuits, such amounts are not reasonably estimable. Our reserves
related to environmental remediation and worker exposure claims recorded in All other liabilities were
$
138
million
and
$
127
million
as of
December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
We record asset retirement obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets as a liability in the period in which the
obligation is incurred and its fair value can be reasonably estimated. These obligations primarily represent nuclear decommissioning, legal
obligations to return leased premises to their initial state or dismantle and repair specific alterations for certain leased sites. The liability is
measured at the present value of the obligation when incurred and is adjusted in subsequent periods. Corresponding asset retirement costs
are capitalized as part of
the carrying value of the related long-lived assets and depreciated over the assetâ€™s useful life. Our asset
retirement obligations were
$
622
million
and
$
581
million
as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and are recorded in All other
current liabilities and All other liabilities in our Consolidated and Combined Statement of Financial Position.
Of these amounts,
$
546
million
and
$
519
million
were related to
nuclear decommissioning obligations. Changes in the liability balance due to settlement, accretion, and
revisions in fair value were not material
during
the year ended December 31, 2024.
Expenditures for nuclear decommissioning, site remediation, and worker exposure claims we
re
$
11
million
,
$
14
million
, and
$
19
million
, for
the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. We presently expect that such expenditures will be approximately
$
13
million
and
$
11
million
in 2025 and 2026, respectively.
