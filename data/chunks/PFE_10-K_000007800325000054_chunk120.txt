approximately $4.5 billion by the end of 2025, most of which was achieved by year-end 2024.
Manufacturing Optimization Program
––
We expect to begin to achieve initial savings from Phase 1 of this multi-phased program in the latter part of 2025 and continue to expect approximately $1.5 billion in savings from this first phase by the end of 2027.
Certain qualifying costs for these programs in all periods since inception were recorded and reflected as Certain Significant Items and excluded from our non-GAAP measure of Adjusted Income. See the
Non-GAAP Financial Measure: Adjusted Income
section within MD&A.
For a description of our programs, as well as the anticipated and actual costs, see
Note 3A
.
The program savings discussed above may be rounded and represent approximations. In addition to these programs, we continuously monitor our operations for cost reduction and/or productivity opportunities in light of patent-based and regulatory exclusivity expiries as well as the expiration of collaborative arrangements for various products. Long-term improvement in gross margin will remain a key focus for the Company over the next few years.
Seagen acquisition
––
In connection with our acquisition of Seagen, we are focusing our efforts on achieving an appropriate cost structure for the combined company. We expect to generate approximately $1 billion of annual cost synergies, to be achieved by 2026. The one-time costs to generate these synergies are expected to be approximately $1.7 billion, incurred primarily from 2023 through 2025.
Other (Income)/Deductions––Net
2024 v. 2023
The unfavorable period-over-period change of $4.2 billion was primarily driven by (i) higher net interest expense of $2.0 billion, (ii) an unfavorable impact of $760 million due to net periodic benefit costs associated with pension and postretirement plans in 2024 versus net periodic benefit credits in 2023, (iii) lower net gains on equity securities of $580 million, (iv) a charge of $420 million in 2024 related to the expected sale of one of our facilities resulting from the discontinuation of our DMD program and (v) lower Haleon equity method income of $400 million, partially offset by (vi) gains of $945 million in 2024 on the partial sales of our investment in Haleon.
2023 v. 2022
The favorable period-over period change of $840 million was mainly driven by a favorable impact of $2.9 billion due to net gains on equity securities in 2023 versus net losses recognized on equity securities in 2022 and lower net interest expense of $400 million, partially offset by higher intangible asset impairment charges of $2.6 billion.
