Our policies provide for cybersecurity awareness training for employees and engagement in due diligence processes in accordance with industry best practices for third-party vendors, including those handling critical services or sensitive data on our behalf.
Our policies also provide for regular, senior management-led table-top exercises simulating cyberattack scenarios to ensure preparedness and response agility. We undertake an annual review of our policies to help ensure their effectiveness and relevance in light of evolving cybersecurity threats.  Additionally, we maintain cyber insurance to help cover costs associated with the occurrence of certain cybersecurity events. We do not currently
