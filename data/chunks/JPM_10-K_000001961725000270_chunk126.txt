artificial intelligence, may not be effective in all cases to identify, observe and mitigate risk due to a variety of factors, such as:
•
reliance on historical trends that may not persist in the future, including assumptions underlying the models and estimations such as correlations among certain market indicators or asset prices
•
inherent limitations associated with forecasting uncertain economic and financial outcomes
•
historical trend information may be incomplete, or may not be indicative of severely negative market conditions such as extreme volatility, dislocation or lack of liquidity
•
sudden illiquidity in markets or declines in prices of certain loans and securities may make it more difficult to value certain financial instruments
•
technology that is introduced to run models or estimations may not perform as expected, or may not be well understood by the personnel using the technology
•
models and estimations may contain erroneous data, valuations, formulas or algorithms
•
review processes may fail to detect flaws in models and estimations, and

•
models may inadvertently incorporate biases present in data used in the models.
JPMorganChase may experience unexpected losses if models, estimates or judgments used or applied in connection with its risk management activities or the preparation of its financial statements are inadequate or incorrect. For example, where quoted market prices are not available for certain financial instruments that require a determination of their fair value, JPMorganChase may make fair value determinations based on internally developed models or other means which ultimately rely to some degree on management estimates and judgment. In addition, JPMorganChase may experience increased uncertainty in its estimates if assets acquired differ from those used to develop those models, which may lead to unexpected losses.
Similarly, JPMorganChase establishes an allowance for expected credit losses related to its credit exposures which requires significant judgments, including forecasts of how macroeconomic conditions might impair the ability of JPMorganChase’s clients and customers to repay their loans or other obligations. These types of estimates and judgments may not prove to be accurate due to a variety of factors, including when the current and forecasted environments are significantly different from the historical environments upon which the models were developed. The increased uncertainty may necessitate a greater degree of judgment and analytics to inform any adjustments that JPMorganChase may make to model outputs than would otherwise be the case.
Some of the models and other analytical and judgment-based estimations used by JPMorganChase in managing risks are subject to review by, and require the approval of, JPMorganChase’s regulators. These reviews are required before JPMorganChase may use those models and estimations for calculating market risk RWA, credit risk RWA and operational risk RWA under
