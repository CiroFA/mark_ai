Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits Plans
On December 20, 2024, we settled $
572
million of our Sprint Retirement Pension Plan retiree obligations, resulting in a gain of $
80
million, recognized within Other income (expense), net on our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. This partial plan settlement is the result of us purchasing a nonparticipating annuity that involves the transfer of significant risk from us to the insurance company (commonly referred to as a “buy-out”). This transaction is an irrevocable action, relieves us of our

responsibility for the postretirement benefit obligations that were settled, and eliminates the risks related to the obligation and the assets used to effect the settlement.
The objective for the investment portfolio of the Pension Plan is to achieve a long-term nominal rate of return, net of fees, that exceeds the Pension Plan's long-term expected rate of return on investments for funding purposes. To meet this objective, our investment strategy is governed by an asset allocation policy, whereby a targeted allocation percentage is assigned to each asset class as follows:
48
% to equities;
39
% to fixed income investments; and
13
% to real estate, infrastructure and private assets. Actual allocations are allowed to deviate from target allocation percentages within a range for each asset class as defined in the investment policy. The long-term expected rate of return on plan assets was
7
% for both the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, while the actual rate of return on plan assets was
6
% and
11
% for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The long-term expected rate of return on investments for funding purposes is
8
% for the year ended December 31, 2025.
