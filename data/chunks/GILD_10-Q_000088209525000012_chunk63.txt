following the strategic decision to discontinue our clinical development program in metastatic NSCLC for Trodelvy in the second-line indication (for more information, see Note 7. Intangible Assets of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q). We also continue to monitor the progression of our in-process research and development assets related to sacituzumab govitecan-hziy for non-small cell lung cancer and bulevirtide for chronic hepatitis D virus for treatment primarily in the U.S. and may need to evaluate these items for impairment prior to the fourth quarter if there are any events or circumstances in our ongoing development activities indicating it is more like than not that these assets might be impaired. For option structured deals, there is no assurance that we will elect to exercise our option right, and it is possible that disagreements, uncertainties or other circumstances may arise, including with respect to whether our option rights have been appropriately triggered, which may hinder our ability to realize the expected benefits. For equity investments in our strategic partners, such as in connection with our collaborations with Arcus, Galapagos NV and Arcellx, Inc., the value of our equity investments may fluctuate and decline in value. If we are not successful in the execution or implementation of these transactions, our financial condition, cash flows and results of operations may be adversely affected, and our stock price could decline.
We have paid substantial amounts of cash and incurred additional debt to finance our strategic transactions. Additional indebtedness and a lower cash balance could result in a downgrade of our credit ratings, limit our ability to borrow additional funds or refinance existing debt on favorable terms, increase our vulnerability to adverse economic or industry conditions, and reduce our financial flexibility to continue with our capital investments, stock repurchases and dividend payments. We may be adversely impacted by any failure to overcome these additional risks.

We are also subject to the examination of our tax returns and other tax matters by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and tax authorities in various foreign jurisdictions. There are
