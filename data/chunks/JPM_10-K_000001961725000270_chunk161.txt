Capital allocation
The amount of capital assigned to each LOB and Corporate is referred to as equity. The Firm’s current equity allocation methodology incorporates Basel III Standardized risk-weighted assets (“RWA”) and the global systemically important banks (“GSIB”) surcharge, both under rules currently in effect, as well as a simulation of capital depletion in a severe stress environment. At least annually, the assumptions, judgments and methodologies used to allocate capital are reassessed and, as a result, the capital allocated to the LOBs and Corporate may change. Refer to Line of business and Corporate equity on page 104 for additional information on capital allocation.
