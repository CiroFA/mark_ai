Gross margin decreased 20 basis points to 51.8% of net sales for the period. The decrease in gross margin was due to:
•
100 basis points of decline from unfavorable product mix,
•
40 basis points of product and packaging investments,
•
30 basis points of higher commodity costs,
•
20 basis points of higher transportation services and other costs and
•
10 basis points of unfavorable foreign exchange impacts.
These impacts were partially offset by:
•
160 basis points of manufacturing productivity savings and
•
20 basis points of increase due to higher pricing.
Total SG&A spending decreased 1% to $16.8 billion versus the prior year period due to higher foreign exchange transactional charges in the prior year period and decreased overhead costs. SG&A as a percentage of net sales decreased 40 basis points to 26.4% due primarily to a decrease in other operating expenses as a percentage of sales. Marketing spending as a percentage of net sales increased 10 basis points as the increase in marketing spending was partially offset by productivity savings. Overhead costs as a percentage of net sales were unchanged as wage inflation was offset by productivity savings, which includes adjustments to expected variable compensation payouts. Other operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 40 basis points primarily driven by favorable foreign exchange impacts. Productivity-driven cost savings delivered 100 basis points of benefit to SG&A as a percentage of net sales.
Operating income increased $1.4 billion, or 10%, to $16.1 billion and operating margin increased 230 basis points to 25.4% versus the prior year period due primarily to the non-cash impairment charge of $1.3 billion ($1.0 billion after tax) on the Gillette intangible asset in the prior year.
Non-Operating Expenses and Income
Interest expense was $695 million for the period, a decrease of $10 million versus the prior year period. Interest income was $365 million for the period, a decrease of $1 million versus the prior year period. Other non-operating income/(expense) was $(120) million, which is a decrease of $690 million versus the prior year period primarily due to the non-cash charge for accumulated foreign currency translation losses due to the substantial liquidation of operations in Argentina recorded in the period ended September 30, 2024.
Income Taxes
The effective income tax rate for the nine months ended March 31, 2025, was 20.5%, compared to 20.6% for the nine months ended March 31, 2024. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily driven by higher excess tax benefits of share-based compensation, favorable geographic mix impacts and decreases from discrete impacts related to uncertain tax positions, partially offset by a 100 basis-point increase due primarily to the charge for accumulated foreign currency translation losses due to the substantial liquidation of operations in Argentina.
