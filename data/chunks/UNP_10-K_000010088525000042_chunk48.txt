measured in feet. Our train length increased 1% compared to 2023 due to train length improvement initiatives and increases in international intermodal shipments, which generally move on longer trains, partially offset by declines in coal train length.
Service Performance Index (SPI)
– SPI is a ratio of the service customers are currently receiving relative to the best monthly performance over the last three years. Measuring our performance relative to a historical benchmark demonstrates our focus on continuously improving service for our customers, and we believe it is a better indicator of service performance than the previously disclosed trip plan compliance. SPI does not replace the service commitments we have contractually agreed to with a small number of customers. SPI is calculated for intermodal and manifest products. Intermodal SPI improved 2 points, at the same time international volume surged. Manifest SPI improved 4 points in 2024 compared to 2023.
Workforce Productivity
– Workforce productivity is average daily car miles per employee. Workforce productivity improved 6% in 2024 as average daily car miles increased 2% and employees decreased 4% compared to 2023. Our active TE&Y workforce increased to support carload demand and increased crew needs associated with labor agreements that went into effect in the third quarter of 2023. In addition, we are maintaining an adequate training pipeline to provide a capacity buffer to enable responsiveness in an ever-changing demand and operating environment.
Operating Ratio
– Operating ratio is our operating expenses reflected as a percentage of operating revenues. Our operating ratio of 59.9% improved 2.4 points compared to 2023 driven by productivity initiatives, core pricing gains, and the year-over-year impact from lower fuel prices, partially offset by inflation and other costs. In addition, operating ratio year-over-year comparison was positively impacted by 2024 contract settlements, a 2024 gain on the sale of intermodal equipment, and lower labor agreement ratification charges than in 2023.
Return on Average Common Shareholders’ Equity
Return on Invested Capital as Adjusted (ROIC)
ROIC is considered a non-GAAP financial measure by SEC Regulation G and Item 10 of SEC Regulation S-K and may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner. We believe this measure is important to management and investors in evaluating the efficiency and effectiveness of our long-term capital investments. In addition, we currently use ROIC as a performance criterion in determining certain elements of equity compensation for our executives. ROIC should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, other information provided in accordance with GAAP. The most comparable GAAP measure is return on average common shareholders’ equity. The tables above provide a reconciliation from return on average common shareholders’ equity to ROIC.
