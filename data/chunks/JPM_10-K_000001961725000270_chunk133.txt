parties to joint ventures with JPMorganChase, and vendors with which JPMorganChase does business.
Social and environmental activists have been targeting JPMorganChase and other financial services firms with public criticism concerning their business practices, including business relationships with clients that are engaged in certain sensitive industries, such as companies:
•
whose products are or are perceived to be harmful to human health, or
•
whose activities negatively affect or are perceived to negatively affect the environment, workers’ rights or communities.
Activists have also taken actions intended to change or influence JPMorganChase’s business practices with respect to ESG matters, including public protests at JPMorganChase’s headquarters and other properties, and submitting specific ESG-related proposals for a vote by JPMorganChase’s shareholders.
In addition, JPMorganChase has been and expects that it will continue to be criticized by activists, politicians and other members of the public concerning business practices or positions taken by JPMorganChase with respect to matters of public policy (such as diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives) or regarding transactions or other business or interactions between JPMorganChase and governmental or regulatory bodies. Furthermore, JPMorganChase's relationships or ability to transact with clients and customers, and with governmental or regulatory bodies in jurisdictions in which JPMorganChase does business, could be adversely affected if its decisions with respect to doing business with companies in certain sensitive industries are perceived to harm those companies or to align with particular political viewpoints. The foregoing types of criticism can be more widespread during election years in various jurisdictions, and could have the effect of focusing attention on a company such as JPMorganChase as part of a wider public debate on public policy matters. Furthermore, JPMorganChase's participation in or association with certain environmental and social industry groups or initiatives could be viewed by activists or governmental authorities as boycotting or other discriminatory business behavior.
These and other types of criticism and actions directed at JPMorganChase could potentially engender dissatisfaction among clients, customers, investors, employees, government officials and other stakeholders. In all of these cases, JPMorganChase’s reputation and its business and results of operations could be harmed by:
•
greater scrutiny from governmental or regulatory bodies, or further criticism from politicians and other members of the public, including in the form of governmental or regulatory investigations or litigation
•
unfavorable coverage or commentary in the media, including through social media campaigns
•
certain clients and customers ceasing doing business with JPMorganChase, and encouraging others to do so
•
impairment of JPMorganChase’s ability to attract new clients and
