restricted in connection with certain legal matters related to legacy GE operations. The liability reflects the use of these
funds to settle any associated obligations and the return of any remaining cash to GE in a future reporting period once resolved. In addition,
the liability includes
$
149
million
of indemnifications in connection with agreements entered into with GE related to the Spin-Off, including
the Tax Matters Agreement.
Product Warranties

We provide for estimated product warranty expenses when we sell the related products. Because warranty estimates
are forecasts that are based on the best available information, mostly historical claims experience, claims costs may differ from amounts
provided.
The liability for product warranties was
$
1,405
million
and
$
1,370
million
as of
March 31, 2025
and

Credit
Facilities
.
We have
$
6,000
million
of credit facilities consisting of (i) a
five
-year
unsecured revolving credit facility in an aggregate
committed amount of
$
3,000
million
and (ii) a standby letter of credit and bank guarantee facility in an aggregate committed amount of
$
3,000
million
. For further information, see Note 22 in the Notes to our consolidated and combined financial statements in our Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024.
Fees related to the unused portion of the facilities were insignificant in
the three months ended March 31, 2025.
Legal Matters
.
In the normal course of our business, we are involved from time to time in various arbitrations, class actions, commercial
litigation, investigations, and other legal, regulatory, or governmental actions, including the significant matters described below that could
have a material impact on our results of operations. In many proceedings, including the specific matters described below, it is inherently
difficult to determine whether any loss is probable or even reasonably possible or to estimate the size or range of the possible loss, and
accruals for legal matters are not recorded until a loss for a particular matter is considered probable and reasonably estimable. Given the
nature of legal matters and the complexities involved, it is often difficult to predict and determine a meaningful estimate of loss or range of
loss until we know, among other factors, the particular claims involved, the likelihood of success of our defenses to those claims, the
damages or other relief sought, how discovery or other procedural considerations will affect the outcome, the settlement posture of other
parties, and other factors that may have a material effect on the outcome. For these matters, unless otherwise specified, we do not believe
it is possible to provide a meaningful estimate of loss at this time. Moreover, it is not uncommon for legal matters to be resolved over many
years, during which time relevant developments and new information must be continuously evaluated.
