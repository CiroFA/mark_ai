acquisitions, investments, joint ventures, partnerships, or divestitures to support our growth
and financial performance, and our failure to successfully execute these transactions could adversely affect our business.
Our
business strategy may include the acquisition, in part or in whole, of technologies and businesses that expand or complement our existing
businesses. Successful growth through acquisitions depends upon our ability to identify suitable acquisition targets or assets, conduct due
diligence, negotiate transactions on favorable terms, and ultimately complete such transactions and integrate the acquired target or asset
successfully. Certain transactions may be subject, in certain circumstances, to the consent of
GE
under the Tax Matters Agreement, as
discussed in “—Risks Relating to the Spin-Off.”
Transactions may expose us to significant risks and uncertainties, including:
•
competition for targets and assets, which may lead to substantial increases in purchase price or terms that are less attractive to
us;
•
failure to timely integrate or separate acquired or divested companies’ assets, people, and products;
•
failure to comply with laws and regulations, including any required disclosures and filings, in one or multiple jurisdictions in relation
to a transaction;
•
expenses, delays, and difficulties in integrating acquired businesses into our existing businesses;
•
diversion of our management’s attention from existing operations to the
acquisition
and integration process, as applicable;
•
dependence on external sources of capital, in particular to finance the purchase price of Transactions;
•
rulings by antitrust or other regulatory bodies;
•
acquired companies’ previous failures to comply with applicable legal, regulatory or other governmental requirements;
•
inability to produce products at increased scale or loss of previously available distribution channels;
•
heightened external scrutiny on acquired IP rights, or lack of IP rights for the acquired portfolio;
•
a failure to accurately predict or to realize expected growth opportunities, cost savings, synergies, and market acceptance of
acquired companies’ products;
•
a failure to identify or appropriately assess material issues, problems or liabilities during due diligence review of acquisition targets
(or its agents) prior to acquisition;
•
successor liability imposed by regulators for actions by the target (or its agents) prior to acquisition;
•
continued losses and exposures for liabilities not transferred to a buyer or otherwise divested in a divestiture;
•
difficulties in retaining key customers and personnel; and
•
adverse market reactions to a transaction.
Various other assessments and assumptions regarding a transaction may prove to be incorrect, and actual developments may differ
significantly from our expectations.
In addition, we also regularly evaluate a variety of potential strategic transactions, including equity method investments, joint ventures and
other
