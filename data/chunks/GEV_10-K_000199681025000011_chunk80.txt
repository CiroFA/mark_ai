an equipment
license, as required by local law related to synthetic greenhouse gas management and seek a court order to impose civil penalties for
delinquent reporting under such law. The applicable local law regulates the import to Australia of synthetic greenhouse gases in equipment,
including certain of our switchgear products, and our subsidiary had neglected to renew the import license required under the law. We
responded to DCCEEW, and following discussions with the agency, paid approximately $0.3 million in fines in connection with the
infringement notices during the three months ended June 30, 2024. Discussions with DCCEEW regarding a court-issued civil penalty order
are pending and we expect additional fines and related costs associated with such order may be more than $300,000. See Note

Notes to the consolidated and combined financial statements for additional information relating to legal matters.
