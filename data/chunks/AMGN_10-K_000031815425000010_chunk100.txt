•
failure to comply with our quality standards which results in quality and product failures, complaints, product contamination and/or recall;
•
a material shortage, contamination, recall and/or restrictions on the use of certain biologically derived substances or other raw materials;
•
discovery of previously unknown or undetected imperfections in raw materials, medical devices or components;
•
cyberattacks on supplier systems;
•
natural or other disasters, including hurricanes, earthquakes, volcanoes or fires;
•
labor disputes (such as strikes) or shortages, including from the effects of health emergencies (such as novel viruses or pandemics) or natural disasters; and
•
geopolitical conflicts (such as the ongoing conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East).
For example, in prior years we have experienced shortages in certain components necessary for the formulation, fill and finish of certain of our products in our Puerto Rico facility, and we have also experienced shortages related to single use systems and packaging which has caused disruptions to our manufacturing plans. Further quality issues that result in unexpected additional demand for certain components have resulted in shortages and in the future may lead to shortages of

required raw materials or components (such as we have experienced with EPOGEN glass vials). We may experience similar or other shortages in the future resulting in delayed shipments, supply constraints, clinical trial delays, contract disputes and/or stock-outs of our products. These or other similar events could negatively affect our ability to satisfy demand for our products or conduct clinical trials, which could have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations.
Manufacturing difficulties, disruptions or delays could limit supply of our products and limit our product sales.
Manufacturing biologic and small molecule human therapeutic products is difficult, complex and highly regulated. We manufacture many of our commercial products and product candidates internally. In addition, we use third-party contract manufacturers to produce, or assist in the production of, a number of our products, and we currently use contract manufacturers to produce, or assist in the production of, a number of our late-stage product candidates and drug delivery devices. The number of third-party contract manufacturers that we use has increased with our acquisition of Horizon, as Horizon required such contract manufacturers for all of its products.

Our efforts to collaborate with or acquire other companies, products, or technology, and to integrate the operations of companies or to support the products or technology we have acquired, may not be successful, and may result in unanticipated costs, delays or failures to realize the benefits of the transactions
