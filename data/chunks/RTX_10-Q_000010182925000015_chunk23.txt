Note 20: Accounting Pronouncements
In November 2024, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2024-03, Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses, which requires a tabular disclosure of the amounts of specified natural expense categories included in each relevant expense caption. Additionally, ASU 2024-03 requires the disclosure of the total amount of selling expenses and, in annual reporting periods, an entity’s definition of selling expenses.

Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact on our disclosures of adopting this new pronouncement.

The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, on a prospective basis. Early adoption and
