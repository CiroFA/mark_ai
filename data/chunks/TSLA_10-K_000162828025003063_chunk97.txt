Commitments and Contingencies
Operating Lease Arrangement in Buffalo, New York
We have an operating lease arrangement through the Research Foundation for the SUNY Foundation with respect to Gigafactory New York. Under the lease and a related research and development agreement, we are continuing to further develop the facility.
Under this agreement, we are obligated to, among other things, meet employment targets as well as specified minimum numbers of personnel in the State of New York and in Buffalo, New York and spend or incur $
5.00
billion in combined capital, operational expenses, costs of goods sold and other costs in the State of New York during the
10
-year period beginning April 30, 2018. On an annual basis during the initial lease term, as measured on each anniversary of such date, if we fail to meet these specified investment and job creation requirements, it may result in our incurring financial liabilities in the form of “program payments” which would not be expected to have a material adverse effect to our financial operations, the termination of our lease at Gigafactory New York, and/or the need to adjust certain of our operations.
In 2021, an amendment was executed to extend our overall agreement to spend or incur $
5.00
billion in combined capital, operational expenses, costs of goods sold and other costs in the State of New York through December 31, 2029. As of December 31, 2024, we have met and expect to meet the requirements under this arrangement, as may be modified and discussed from time to time, based on our current and anticipated level of operations.
Operating Lease Arrangement in Shanghai, China
We have an operating lease arrangement for an initial term of
50
years with the local government of Shanghai for land use rights where we have been constructing Gigafactory Shanghai. Under the terms of the arrangement, we are required to spend RMB
14.08
billion in capital expenditures by the end of 2023, which was achieved in 2023, and to generate RMB
2.23
billion of annual tax revenues starting at the end of 2023. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had met and expect to meet the tax revenue requirements based on our current level of spend and sales.
