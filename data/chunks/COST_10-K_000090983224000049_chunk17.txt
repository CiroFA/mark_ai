disruption in the transport of goods to or from overseas, damage to buildings or inventory, delays in the delivery of goods to our warehouses or depots, the temporary reduction in the availability of products in our warehouses, and long-term disruption or threats to the habitability of key markets in which we operate. These events could also reduce demand for our products or make it difficult or impossible to procure products. We may be required to suspend operations in some or all of our locations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Pandemics and other health crises could affect our business, financial condition and results of operations in many respects.
The emergence, severity, magnitude and duration of global or regional health crises are uncertain and difficult to predict. A pandemic could affect certain business operations, demand for our products and services, in-stock positions, costs of doing business, availability of labor, access to inventory, supply chain operations, our ability to predict future performance, exposure to litigation, and our financial performance, among other things. Other factors and uncertainties include, but are not limited to:
•
The severity and duration of pandemics;
•
Evolving macroeconomic factors, including general economic uncertainty, unemployment rates, and recessionary pressures;
•
Changes in labor markets affecting us and our suppliers;
•
Unknown consequences on our business performance and initiatives stemming from the substantial investment of time and other resources to the pandemic response;
•
The pace of post-pandemic recovery;
•
The long-term impact of the pandemic on our business, including consumer behaviors; and
•
Disruption and volatility within the financial and credit markets.
