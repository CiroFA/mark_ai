Commercialization and Distribution
We have U.S. and international commercial sales operations, with marketing subsidiaries in more than 35 countries. Our products are marketed through our commercial teams and/or in conjunction with third-party wholesalers, distributors and corporate partners. Our commercial teams promote our products through direct field contact with physicians, hospitals, clinics and other healthcare providers. We generally grant our third-party distributors the exclusive right to promote our product in a territory for a specified period of time. Most of our agreements with these distributors provide for collaborative efforts between the distributor and Gilead in obtaining and maintaining regulatory approval for the product in the specified territory.
We sell and distribute most of our products in the U.S. exclusively through the wholesale channel. During the year ended December 31, 2024, approximately 91% of our product sales in the U.S. and approximately 65% of our total worldwide revenues were from three large wholesalers: Cardinal Health, Inc., Cencora, Inc. and McKesson Corporation, and their specialty distributor affiliates. We sell and distribute our products in Europe and countries outside the U.S. where the product is approved, either through our commercial teams, third-party distributors or corporate partners.
