Retirement Plans
Defined Benefit Pension Plans
The U.S. defined benefit pension plans primarily consist of a qualified pension plan. Benefits of the qualified pension plan are provided under an adjusted career-average-pay program, a cash-balance program or a dollar-per-month program. Benefit accruals under this plan were frozen in 2009. Participants in the adjusted career-average-pay program no longer earn service accruals. Participants in the cash-balance program no longer earn service accruals, but continue to earn
4
% interest per year on their cash-balance accounts. There are no active participants under the dollar-per-month program. We also have a frozen non-qualified supplemental pension plan in the United States that principally provides benefits based on compensation in excess of amounts that can be considered under the qualified pension plan.
For certain non-U.S. countries, we also have defined benefit pension plans for eligible employees. Eligibility is generally determined based on the terms of our plans and local statutory requirements.
