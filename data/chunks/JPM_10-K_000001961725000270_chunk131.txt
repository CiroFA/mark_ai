market and industry participants, and with each other, every day. All employees are expected to demonstrate values and exhibit the behaviors that are an integral part of JPMorganChase’s Code of Conduct and Business Principles. JPMorganChase endeavors to embed conduct risk management throughout an employee’s life cycle, including recruiting, onboarding, training and development, and performance management. Conduct risk management is also an integral component of JPMorganChase’s promotion and compensation processes.
Notwithstanding these expectations, policies and practices, certain employees have engaged in improper or illegal conduct in the past. These instances of misconduct have resulted in litigation, and resolutions of governmental investigations or enforcement actions involving consent orders, deferred prosecution agreements, non-prosecution agreements and other civil or criminal sanctions. There is no assurance that further inappropriate or unlawful actions by employees have not occurred or will not occur, lead to a violation of the terms of these resolutions (and associated consequences), or that any such actions will always be detected, deterred or prevented.
JPMorganChase’s reputation could be harmed by, and collateral consequences could result from, a failure by
one or more employees to conduct themselves in accordance with JPMorganChase’s expectations, policies and practices, including by acting in ways that harm clients, customers, other market participants, employees or others. Some examples of this include:

engaging in insider trading, market manipulation or unauthorized trading
•
engaging in improper or fraudulent behavior in connection with government relief programs
