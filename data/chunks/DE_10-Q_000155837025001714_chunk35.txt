SUPPLEMENTAL CONSOLIDATING DATA
The supplemental consolidating data presented on the subsequent pages is presented for informational purposes. Equipment operations represent the enterprise without financial services. Equipment operations include production and precision agriculture operations, small agriculture and turf operations, construction and forestry operations, and other corporate assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses not reflected within financial services. Transactions between the equipment operations and financial services have been eliminated to arrive at the consolidated financial statements.
Equipment operations and financial services participate in different industries. Equipment operations primarily generate earnings and cash flows by manufacturing and selling equipment, service parts, and technology solutions to dealers and retail customers. Financial services finance sales and leases by dealers of new and used equipment that is largely manufactured by equipment operations. Those earnings and cash flows generally are the difference between the finance income received from customer payments less interest expense, and depreciation on equipment subject to an operating lease. The two businesses are capitalized differently and have separate performance metrics. The supplemental consolidating data is also used by management due to these differences.
