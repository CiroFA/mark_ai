and largely eliminate the amount of Other Income (Loss) – Net Gains (Losses) from Fund Investment Activities from the Net Income Attributable to Blackstone Inc.
Net Income Attributable to Non-Controlling Interests in Blackstone Holdings is derived from the Income Before Provision for Taxes at the Blackstone Holdings level, excluding the Net Gains (Losses) from Fund Investment Activities and the percentage allocation of the income between Blackstone personnel and others who are limited partners of Blackstone Holdings and Blackstone after considering any contractual arrangements that govern the allocation of income such as fees allocable to Blackstone.
For the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, the Net Income Before Taxes allocated to Blackstone personnel and others who are limited partners of Blackstone Holdings was 38.0% and 38.8%, respectively. The decrease of 0.8% was primarily due to the conversion of Blackstone Holdings Partnership Units to shares of common stock and the vesting of shares of common stock.
The Other Income (Loss) — Change in Tax Receivable Agreement Liability was entirely allocated to Blackstone Inc.
