Finjan, Inc. v. Palo Alto Networks
On November 4, 2014, Finjan, Inc., filed a lawsuit against us in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. The lawsuit alleges that our products infringe multiple Finjan patents. The complaint requests injunctive relief, monetary damages, and attorneys’ fees. On March 21, 2025, the judge issued an order granting summary judgment of non-infringement on all remaining patents at issue. Plaintiff filed a Notice of Appeal on April 21, 2025. We are unable, at this time, to reasonably estimate a possible loss or potential range of loss, if any.

Stockholders’ Equity
Share Repurchase Program
In February 2019, our board of directors authorized a $
1.0
billion share repurchase program, which is funded from available working capital. In December 2020, August 2021, August 2022, November 2023, and August 2024, our board of directors authorized additional $
700.0
million, $
676.1
million, $
915.0
million, $
316.7
million and $
500.0
million increases to this share repurchase program, respectively, bringing the total authorization under this share repurchase program to $
4.1
billion (our “current authorization”). The expiration date of our current authorization was extended to December 31, 2025, and our repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time. Repurchases may be made at management’s discretion from time to time on the open market, through privately negotiated transactions, transactions structured through investment banking institutions, block purchase techniques, 10b5-1 trading plans, or a combination of the foregoing.
We did not repurchase shares of our common stock during the three and nine months ended April 30, 2025. During the three and nine months ended April 30, 2024, we repurchased and retired
3.4
million and
4.0
million shares of our common stock under our current repurchase authorization for an aggregate purchase price of $
500.0
million and $
566.7
million, including transaction costs, at an average price of $
146.96
and $
142.00
per share, respectively.
As of April 30, 2025, $
1.0
billion remained available for future share repurchases under our current repurchase authorization. The total price of the shares repurchased and related transaction costs are reflected as a reduction to common stock and additional paid-in capital on our condensed consolidated balance sheets.
