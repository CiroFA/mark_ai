Commercial Aircraft Programs
At December 31, 2024 and 2023, commercial aircraft programs inventory included the following amounts related to the 737 program: deferred production costs of $
9,679
and $
6,011
and unamortized tooling and other non-recurring costs of $
909
and $
792
. At December 31, 2024, $
10,542
of 737 deferred production costs, unamortized tooling and other non-recurring costs are expected to be recovered from units included in the program accounting quantity that have firm orders, and $

are expected to be recovered from units included in the program accounting quantity that represent expected future orders.
At December 31, 2024 and 2023, commercial aircraft programs inventory included the following amounts related to the 777X program: $
3,476
and $
4,638
of work in process (including deferred production costs of $
0
and $

) and $
4,122
and $
4,063
of unamortized tooling and other non-recurring costs. In April 2022, we decided to pause production of the 777X-9 during 2022 and 2023, which resulted in abnormal production costs of $
513
and $
325
during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022. In the fourth quarter of 2023, the 777X program resumed production and, as a result,

abnormal production costs during the year ended December 31, 2024. During the year ended December 31, 2024, we determined that estimated costs to complete the 777X program plus the costs already included in 777X inventory exceed estimated revenues from the program. The resulting reach-forward loss of $
3,499
was recorded as a reduction of deferred production costs and other non-recurring costs. The level of profitability on the 777X program will be subject to several factors. These factors include aircraft certification requirements and timing, change incorporation on completed aircraft, production disruption due to labor instability and supply chain disruption, customer considerations, delivery timing and negotiations, further production rate adjustments for the 777X or other commercial aircraft programs, and contraction of the accounting quantity. One or more of these factors could result in additional reach-forward losses in future periods.
At December 31, 2024 and 2023, commercial aircraft programs inventory included the following amounts related to the 787 program: deferred production costs of $
