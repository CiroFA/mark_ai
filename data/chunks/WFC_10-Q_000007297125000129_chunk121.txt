DERIVATIVE VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS.
We incorporate certain adjustments in determining the fair value of our derivatives, including credit valuation adjustments (CVA) to reflect counterparty credit risk related to derivative assets, debit valuation adjustments (DVA) to reflect Wells Fargoâ€™s own credit risk related to derivative liabilities, and funding valuation adjustments (FVA) to reflect the funding cost of uncollateralized or partially collateralized derivative assets and liabilities. CVA, which considers the effects of enforceable master netting agreements and collateral arrangements, reflects market-based views of the credit quality of each counterparty. We estimate CVA based on observed credits spreads in the credit default swap market and indices indicative of the credit quality of the counterparties to our derivatives.
Table 11.7 presents the impact of derivative valuation adjustments (excluding the effect of any related hedges), which are included in net gains (losses) from trading and securities on the consolidated statement of income. For additional information, see Note 2 (Trading Activities).

Sold Credit Derivatives
Credit derivative contracts are arrangements whose value is derived from the transfer of credit risk of a reference asset or entity from one party (the purchaser of credit protection) to another party (the seller of credit protection).
