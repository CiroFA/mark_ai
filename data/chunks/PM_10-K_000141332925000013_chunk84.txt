suspension. Despite this payment suspension and, in order to avoid the future addition of interest, PMI elected, on January 14, 2025, to pay the amount outstanding of EUR 721 million (approximately $751 million), excluding accrued interest. An unfavorable outcome to the appeal would negatively impact PMI’s future cash provided by operating activities for the amounts of unpaid interest.

Operating income increased by 12.5%. Operating income, excluding currency and acquisitions, increased by 12.4%, primarily reflecting: the same factors as for net revenues, as well as a favorable comparison to 2023 reflecting the 2023 charge related to the termination of a pledge agreement with the Foundation for a Smoke-Free World of $60 million, $53 million charge related to the war in Ukraine in 2023 and $47 million related to restructuring charges in 2023. The positive impact of this favorable comparison was partly offset by higher marketing, administration and research costs.

Net revenues increased by 5.9%. Net revenues, excluding currency and acquisitions, increased by 11.7%, primarily reflecting: a favorable pricing variance, predominantly driven by higher combustible tobacco pricing; favorable volume/mix, driven by higher cigarette and HTU volume, coupled with favorable mix; and a favorable comparison to 2023 due to the charge of $80 million following the termination of a distribution arrangement in the Middle East (recognized as a reduction of net revenues in 2023).
