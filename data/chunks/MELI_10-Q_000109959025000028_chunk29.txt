We have a highly fragmented customer revenue base given the large numbers of sellers and buyers who use our platforms. For the three-month periods ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, no single customer accounted for more than 5.0% of our net revenues and financial income.
Our net revenues and financial income are generated in multiple foreign currencies and then translated into U.S. dollars at the average monthly exchange rate. The functional currency for each country’s operations is the country’s local currency, except for Argentina, where the functional currency is the U.S. dollar due to Argentina’s status as a highly inflationary economy. Please refer to Note 2 – Summary of significant accounting policies to our unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements for further detail on foreign currency translation.
Our net revenues and financial income grew during the three-month period ended March 31, 2025 as compared to the same period in 2024, boosted by the growth of credit originations from our lending solution, an increase in total payment volume and fees due to payment in installments in our Mercado Pago platform, and the growth in gross merchandise volume.
