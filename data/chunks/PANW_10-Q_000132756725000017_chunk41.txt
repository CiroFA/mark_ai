increased for the three and nine months ended April 30, 2025 compared to the same periods in 2024 primarily due to the release of our valuation allowance on U.S. federal, U.S. states other than California, and United Kingdom deferred tax assets in the second quarter of fiscal 2024. Refer to Note 13. Income Taxes in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for more information.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
As of April 30, 2025, our total cash, cash equivalents, and investments of $8.5 billion were held for general corporate purposes. As of April 30, 2025, we had no unremitted earnings when evaluating our outside basis difference relating to our U.S. investment in foreign subsidiaries. However, there could be local withholding taxes due to various foreign countries if certain lower tier earnings are distributed. Withholding taxes that would be payable upon remittance of these lower tier earnings are not material.
Our cash tax payments have increased and we expect this trend to continue as a result of our increased profitability and utilization of our net operating loss carryforwards and credits.
DEBT
In June 2020, we issued the 2025 Notes with an aggregate principal amount of $2.0 billion. The 2025 Notes mature on June 1, 2025; however, under certain circumstances, holders may surrender their 2025 Notes for conversion prior to the maturity date. Upon conversion of the 2025 Notes, we will pay cash equal to the aggregate principal amount of the 2025 Notes to be converted, and, at our election, we will pay or deliver cash and/or shares of our common stock for the amount of our conversion obligation in excess of the aggregate principal amount of the 2025 Notes being converted. During the three and nine months ended April 30, 2025, we repaid in cash $150.9 million and $582.3 million, respectively, in aggregate principal amount of the 2025 Notes and issued 2.2 million and 8.4 million shares of common stock to the holders, respectively, for the conversion value in excess of the principal amount of the 2025 Notes converted, which were fully offset by shares we received from our exercise of the associated note hedges.

All of the outstanding 2025 Notes will mature on June 1, 2025 and, at that time, we will become obligated to pay the remaining principal amount of the 2025 Notes of $383.3 million in cash, and deliver shares of our common stock for the amount of our conversion obligation in excess of the aggregate principal amount of the 2025 Notes being converted. We believe that our cash provided by operating activities, our existing cash, cash equivalents, and investments, and existing sources of and access to financing will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs in connection with maturity of the 2025 Notes. As of April 30, 2025, $383.3 million of our 2025 Notes remained outstanding. Refer to Note 9. Debt in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for more information on the 2025 Notes.
