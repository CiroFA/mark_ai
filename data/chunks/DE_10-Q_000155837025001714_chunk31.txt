(primarily in the U.S., Canada, and Europe) driven by overall market uncertainty. Operating profit decreased primarily due to lower shipment volumes, partially offset by lower selling, administrative and general expenses and research and development expenses driven by a decrease in employee profit-sharing incentives, decreased production costs from lower material costs, and price realization.

Small agriculture and turf sales decreased for the quarter due to lower shipment volumes (primarily in the U.S., Canada, and Europe) driven mainly by market uncertainty and high interest rates.

Construction and forestry sales were lower for the quarter due to decreased U.S. shipment volumes, driven by planned underproduction efforts to reduce field inventory and competitive pressures. Operating profit decreased primarily due to lower shipment volumes, unfavorable price realization, and higher selling, administrative and general expenses in part due to marketing events.

The average balance of receivables and leases financed was 3% lower in the first three months of 2025, compared with the same period last year, primarily due to the reclassification of the assets of Banco John Deere S.A. (BJD) to “Assets held for sale” (see Note 20). Excluding the impact of this reclassification, revenue increased due to higher average portfolio balances and financing rates. Net income for the quarter was affected by the decreased valuation allowance on BJD “Assets held for sale” (see Note 20). Excluding the impact of this special item, net income decreased due to a higher provision for credit losses, partially offset by lower selling, administrative and general expenses.

We have access to global markets at a reasonable cost. Sources of liquidity include:

We are forecasting lower operating cash flows from equipment operations in 2025 compared with 2024 driven by a decrease in net income adjusted for non-cash provisions and a lower reduction in inventories in 2025 compared with prior period.
