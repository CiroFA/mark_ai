the actual number of shares that vest after three years include net revenue growth, EPS growth and relative total shareholder return (“TSR”).  Relative TSR is considered a market condition, while net revenue and EPS growth are considered performance conditions.  The Monte Carlo simulation valuation model is used to determine the grant-date fair value.
Compensation expense for PSUs is recognized over the requisite service period, or the date the individual becomes eligible to retire but not less than
seven months
, if it is probable that the performance target will be achieved and subsequently adjusted if the probability assessment changes.  As of December 31, 2024, there was $
37
million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested PSUs.  The cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of

Note: Table may not sum due to rounding.
The effective income tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 were
15.6
%,
17.9
% and
15.4
%, respectively.  The effective income tax rate for 2024 was lower than the effective income tax rate for 2023, primarily due to a discrete tax expense in 2023 related to changes in the valuation allowance associated with the U.S. foreign tax credits deferred tax asset.  In 2023, the treatment of foreign taxes paid under the U.S. tax regulations published in 2022 changed due to the foreign tax legislation enacted in Brazil and Notice 2023-55 (the “Notice”), released by the U.S. Department of Treasury (“Treasury”).  Therefore, the Company recognized a total $
327
million discrete tax expense in 2023 to establish the valuation allowance.  This discrete tax expense was partially offset by the Company’s ability to claim more U.S. foreign tax credits generated in 2022 and 2023 due to the Notice.
