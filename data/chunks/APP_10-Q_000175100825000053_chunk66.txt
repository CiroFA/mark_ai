research, development, analytics, and marketing of our Apps. Our development and marketing efforts are focused on improving the experience of our existing Apps, developing new Apps, and successfully monetizing our Apps. Our Apps generate revenue primarily through the sale of advertising, a substantial portion of which comes from other mobile gaming clients, and IAPs. For Apps distributed through third-party platforms, we are required to share a portion of the proceeds from in-game sales with the platform providers, which share may be subject to changes or increases over time. In order to achieve and maintain our profitability, we need to generate sufficient revenue from our existing and new Apps to offset our ongoing development, marketing, and other operating expenses.
Successfully monetizing our Apps is difficult and requires that we deliver user experiences that a sufficient number of users will pay for through IAPs or we are able to otherwise sufficiently monetize our Apps, including by serving IAA. The success of our Apps depends in part on unpredictable and volatile factors beyond our control including user preferences, competing apps, new third-party platforms, and the availability of other entertainment experiences. If our Apps do not meet user expectations or if they are not brought to market in a timely and effective manner, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.
In addition, our ability to successfully launch or acquire Apps and their ability to achieve commercial success will depend in part on our ability to:
•
effectively and efficiently market our Apps to existing and new users;
•
achieve a positive return on investment from our marketing and user acquisition costs or achieve organic user growth;
•
adapt to changing trends, user preferences, new technologies, and new feature sets for mobile and other devices, including determining whether to invest in development for any new technologies, and achieve a positive return on the costs associated with such adaptation;
•
continue to adapt mobile app feature sets for an increasingly diverse set of mobile devices, including various operating systems and specifications, limited bandwidth, and varying processing power and screen sizes;
•
achieve and maintain successful user engagement and effectively monetize our Apps;
•
develop mobile games that can build upon or become franchise games and expand and enhance our mobile games after their initial releases;
•
develop Apps other than mobile games;
•
identify and execute strategic acquisitions and partnerships;
•
attract advertisers to advertise on our Apps;
•
partner with third-party platforms and obtain featuring opportunities;
•
compete successfully against a large and growing number of competitors;
•
accurately forecast the timing and expense of our operations, including mobile app and feature development, marketing, and user acquisition;
•
minimize and quickly resolve bugs or outages;
•
acquire, or invest in, and
