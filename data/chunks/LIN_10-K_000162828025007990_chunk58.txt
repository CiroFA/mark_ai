establishing deferred tax valuation allowances.
As of December 31, 2024, the company had $
505
million of deferred tax assets relating to net operating losses (“NOLs”) and tax credits and $
146
million of valuation allowances. These deferred tax assets include $
461
million relating to NOLs, of which $
57
million expire within
5
years, $
18
million expire after
5
years, and $
386
million have no expiration. The deferred tax assets also include $
44
million related to credits of which $
3
million expire within
5
years, $
38
million expire after
5
years, and $
3
million have no expiration. The valuation allowances of $
146
million primarily relate to NOLs. Management has determined, based on financial projections and available tax strategies, that it is unlikely that the benefit of these losses will be realized. If events or circumstances change, valuation allowances are adjusted at that time resulting in an income tax benefit or charge.
The company has $
535
million of non-U.S income and withholding taxes accrued related to its investment in non-U.S. subsidiaries and equity investments. A provision has not been made for any additional non-U.S. income or withholding taxes at December 31, 2024 on approximately $
5
billion of unremitted non-U.S. earnings on which the company intends to remain indefinitely reinvested or on other outside basis differences in its investments unrelated to unremitted earnings. A determination of these deferred taxes related to these amounts is not practicable.
Uncertain Tax Positions
Unrecognized income tax benefits represent income tax positions taken on income tax returns but not yet recognized in the consolidated financial statements. The company has unrecognized income tax benefits totaling $
292
million, $
304
million and $
325
million as of December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. If recognized, the majority of the unrecognized tax benefits and related interest and penalties would be recorded as a benefit to income tax expense on the consolidated statements of income.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:
(a)
2023 and 2022 amounts are primarily related to the closure of tax audits.
(b)
Other includes reductions for statute of limitation lapses and foreign currency translation.
The company classifies interest income and expense related to income taxes as tax expense in the consolidated statements of income. The company recognized net interest expense of $
3
million and net interest benefit of  $
17
million and of $
3
million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. The company had $
