quarter charge also includes increased cost allocations from the decision to end production of the 767 freighter program and higher supplier costs. As of December 31, 2024, we had approximately $

of potential termination liabilities to suppliers related to future production lots. Risk remains that we may record additional losses in future periods.
MQ-25
In the third quarter of 2018, we were awarded the MQ-25 EMD contract by the U.S. Navy. The contract is a fixed-price contract that now includes development and delivery of
seven
aircraft and test articles at a contract price of $
890
. In connection with winning the competition, we recognized a reach-forward loss of $
291
in the third quarter of 2018. During 2023, we increased the reach-forward loss by $
231
. In the first quarter of 2024, we were awarded a cost-type contract modification totaling $
657
for
two
additional test aircraft plus other scope increases. During 2024, we increased the reach-forward loss by $
339
. During the third quarter of 2024, we increased the reach-forward loss by $
217
primarily reflecting higher than anticipated production costs to complete EMD aircraft. During the fourth quarter of 2024, we increased the reach-forward loss by $
122
, primarily reflecting costs associated with ongoing design and software development challenges. The initial EMD units are currently progressing through the factory and the increase reflects recent and projected factory performance as well as the higher than anticipated complexity of the production build. We expect the initial units to complete production in 2025 and begin flight testing. We will be initiating final assembly operations at our new facility at Mid-America St. Louis Airport in Mascoutah, Illinois, in 2025. Risk remains that we may record additional losses in future periods.
T-7A Red Hawk EMD Contract & Production Options
In 2018, we were awarded the T-7A Red Hawk program. The EMD portion of the contract is a $
860
fixed-price contract and includes
five
aircraft and
seven
simulators. The production portion of the contract includes production lots for
346
T-7A Red Hawk aircraft and related services that we believe are probable of being exercised. The
five
EMD aircraft have been delivered as of December 31, 2024, and the flight testing is ongoing.
During 2024 and 2023, we increased the reach-forward loss on the T-7A Red Hawk program by $
1,770
and $
275
. The increase in 2024 primarily reflects higher estimated supplier costs related to future production lots. During the first quarter of 2024, we increased the reach-forward loss by $
94
primarily reflecting increases in production costs. During the second quarter of 2024, we increased the reach-forward loss on the program by $
278
primarily driven by higher than anticipated costs to meet certain technical and support requirements. During the third quarter of 2024, we increased the loss on the program by $
