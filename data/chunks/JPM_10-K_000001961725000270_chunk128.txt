business plans to address these strategic priorities, both in the near term and over longer time horizons. Management’s effectiveness in this regard will affect
JPMorganChase’s ability to develop and enhance its resources, control expenses and return capital to shareholders. Each of these objectives could be adversely affected by any failure on the part of management to:
•
devise effective business plans and strategies
•
offer products and services that meet changing expectations of clients and customers
•
allocate capital in a manner that promotes long-term stability to enable JPMorganChase to build and invest in market-leading businesses, even in a highly stressed environment

For example, aggressive or less disciplined lending practices by non-bank competitors could lead to a loss of market share for traditional banks, and in an economic downturn could result in instability in the financial services industry and adversely impact other market participants, including JPMorganChase.
New competitors in the financial services industry continue to emerge. For example, technological advances and the growth of e-commerce have made
