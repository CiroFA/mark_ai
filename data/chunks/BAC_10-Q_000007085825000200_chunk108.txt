The outstanding balance of HELOCs that had reached the end of their draw period and entered the amortization period was $3.3 billion at March 31, 2025. The HELOCs that have entered the amortization period have experienced a higher percentage of early stage delinquencies and nonperforming status when compared to the HELOC portfolio as a whole. At March 31, 2025, $31 million, or one percent, of outstanding HELOCs that had entered the
amortization period were accruing past due 30 days or more. In addition, at March 31, 2025, $239 million, or seven percent, were nonperforming.

During the
three months ended March 31, 2025
