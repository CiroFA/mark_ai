Note Hedges
To minimize the impact of potential economic dilution upon conversion of our convertible senior notes, we entered into separate convertible note hedge transactions (the “2025 Note Hedges”) with respect to our common stock concurrent with the issuance of the 2025 Notes.
The 2025 Note Hedges cover up to
40.3
million shares of our common stock at a strike price per share that corresponds to the initial conversion price of the 2025 Notes, which are also subject to adjustment, and are exercisable upon conversion of the 2025 Notes. The 2025 Note Hedges will expire upon maturity of the 2025 Notes. The 2025 Note Hedges are separate transactions and are not part of the terms of the 2025 Notes. Holders of the 2025 Notes will not have any rights with respect to the 2025 Note Hedges. Any shares of our common stock receivable by us under the 2025 Note Hedges are excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share as they are antidilutive. We paid an aggregate amount of $
370.8
million for the 2025 Note Hedges, which is included in additional paid-in capital on our condensed consolidated balance sheets.
As a result of the conversions of the 2025 Notes settled during the three and nine months ended April 30, 2025, we exercised the corresponding portion of our 2025 Note Hedges and received
2.2
million and
8.4
million shares of our common stock during the respective periods. As a result of the conversions of the 2025 Notes settled during the three and nine months ended April 30, 2024, we exercised the corresponding portion of our 2025 Note Hedges and received
9.1
million and
11.3
million shares of our common stock during the respective periods.
Warrants
Separately, but concurrently with the issuance of each series of our convertible senior notes, we entered into transactions whereby we sold warrants (the “2023 Warrants,” with respect to the
0.75
% convertible senior notes due 2023 issued in July 2018, the “2025 Warrants,” with respect to the 2025 Notes, and the 2023 Warrants together with the 2025 Warrants, the “Warrants”) to acquire shares of our common stock, subject to anti-dilution adjustments. The 2023
