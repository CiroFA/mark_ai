Foreign currency transaction gains or losses on the Euro-denominated debt that is not designated as a hedging instrument for accounting purposes are recognized in "Other income (expense), net" in the Unaudited Consolidated Statements of Operations (see Notes 9 and 15 to our Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements). Such foreign currency transaction gains or losses are dependent on the amount of net assets of the Euro functional currency subsidiaries, the amount of the Euro-denominated debt that is designated as a hedge, and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.

Outlook
While we have seen stable travel demand trends globally in our business so far in the second quarter, these trends could be negatively impacted by the increased uncertainty in the geopolitical and macroeconomic environment, and the potential impact it may have on consumer spending and behavior, travel patterns, our partners, or our ability to conduct our business.
Taking into account the above, for the second quarter of 2025, on a year-over-year basis we currently expect:
•
growth in room nights will be between 4% and 6%;
•
growth in gross bookings will be between 10% and 12% on a reported basis and between 6% and 8% on a constant currency basis;
•
growth in revenues will be between 10% and 12% on a reported basis and between 6% and 8% on a constant currency basis; and
•
operating income will increase on both a reported basis and a constant currency basis.
Due to the increased uncertainty in the geopolitical and macroeconomic environment, we are widening the range of our full year 2025 expectations for constant currency growth relative to our prior expectation. For the full year 2025, on a year-over-year basis we currently expect:
•
growth in gross bookings on a constant currency basis will be in a mid to high single digit percentage range;
•
growth in revenues on a constant currency basis will be in a mid to high single digit percentage range; and
•
operating income will increase on a constant currency basis.

Critical Accounting Estimates
Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is based upon our Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Certain of our accounting estimates are important to our financial position and results of operations and require us to make difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. We use our judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in the determination of certain estimates and we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis. Estimates are based on
