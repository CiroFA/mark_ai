Stock-Based Compensation Expense
The following table summarizes the stock-based compensation expense related to our equity awards (in thousands):
Determination of Fair Value
We record stock-based compensation awards based on fair value as of the grant date. We value RSUs at the market close price of our common stock on the grant date. For option awards and ESPP offerings, we use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to determine fair value. We recognize such costs as compensation expense generally on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award.
As of December 31, 2024, there were $
1.0
billion of unrecognized compensation costs related to all unvested awards. The unamortized compensation costs are expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately
4.2
years.
