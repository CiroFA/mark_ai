CareFirst of Maryland Antitrust Class Action
On August 6, 2024, CareFirst of Maryland, Inc., Group Hospitalization and Medical Services, Inc., and CareFirst BlueChoice, Inc. (collectively, CareFirst), filed a class action antitrust lawsuit against Amgen Inc., Amgen Manufacturing, Limited (corrected to Amgen Manufacturing Limited LLC in CareFirst’s amended complaint on October 11, 2024), and Immunex Corporation in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, alleging federal and state antitrust claims and state consumer protection claims. The plaintiffs allege that, in 2004, Amgen entered into an anticompetitive agreement with certain F. Hoffman-La Roche AG entities (Roche) and other parties that provided Amgen with rights to Roche’s patents in a manner that enabled Amgen to allegedly unlawfully extend the life of patents applicable to ENBREL and, thereby, delay biosimilar entry. On November 4, 2024, Amgen filed a motion to dismiss, and plaintiffs thereafter filed an amended complaint on November 25, 2024. On January 8, 2025, Amgen filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint.

Securities Class Action Litigation (Roofers Local No. 149 Pension Fund)
On March 13, 2023, Roofers Local No. 149 Pension Fund filed a purported class action against Amgen, Robert Bradway and Peter Griffith in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York (Southern District Court of New York). The action was brought on behalf of an alleged class of Amgen shareholders who owned stock between July 29, 2020 and April 27, 2022 (the alleged class period). Plaintiffs allege that the defendants made a series of materially false and misleading statements and omissions during the alleged class period regarding the failure to timely disclose the potential tax liability claimed by the IRS. Plaintiffs further allege that they and other purported class members suffered losses and damages resulting from declines in the market value of Amgen’s common stock after the potential tax liability claimed by the IRS was disclosed.
On August 31, 2023, plaintiff filed an amended complaint and Amgen filed a motion to dismiss on November 6, 2023, which the Southern District Court of New York denied on September 30, 2024. On November 20, 2024,
