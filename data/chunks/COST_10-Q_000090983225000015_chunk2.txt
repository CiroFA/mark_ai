interim financial reporting pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). While these statements reflect all normal recurring adjustments that are, in the opinion of management, necessary for fair presentation of the results of the interim period, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) for complete financial statements. Therefore, the interim condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 1, 2024.
Fiscal Year End
The Company operates on a 52/53 week fiscal year basis, with the fiscal year ending on the Sunday closest to August 31. Fiscal 2025 is a 52-week year ending on August 31, 2025. References to the second quarter of 2025 and 2024 relate to the 12-week fiscal quarters ended February 16, 2025, and February 18, 2024. References to the first half of 2025 and 2024 relate to the 24 weeks ended February 16, 2025, and February 18, 2024.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect; the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements; and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. These estimates and assumptions take into account historical and forward-looking factors that the Company believes are reasonable. Actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions.
Reclassification
Reclassifications were made to the condensed consolidated balance sheet for 2024 and to the statement of cash flows for the first half of 2024. These changes were made to conform with the current year presentation.
