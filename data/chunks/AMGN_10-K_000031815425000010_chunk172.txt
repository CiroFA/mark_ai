Equity securities
BeiGene, Ltd.
On January 2, 2020, we acquired a
20.5
% ownership interest in BeiGene for $
2.8
billion, substantially all of which was attributed to the fair value of equity securities, and we began using the equity method of accounting for this investment. Since the fair value of equity securities acquired exceeded our proportionate share of the carrying value of BeiGene’s underlying net assets, we began amortizing the intangible assets that gave rise to this basis difference over their useful lives.
Effective January 30, 2023, we relinquished our right to appoint a director to BeiGene’s Board of Directors. We no longer have the ability to exert significant influence over BeiGene. As a result, in the first quarter of 2023, we began to account for our ownership interest as an equity security with a readily determinable fair value, which is carried at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in Other income (expense), net, in the Consolidated Statements of Income. See Note 18, Fair value measurement. During the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, we recognized unrealized gains of
$
82
million and $
1.2
billion, respectively,
in Other income (expense), net, in the Consolidated Statements of Income. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the fair values of our investment in BeiGene were $
3.5
billion and $
3.4
billion, respectively,
and were included in Other noncurrent assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
During the year ended December 31, 2022, under the equity method of accounting, the carrying value of the investment
