$211 million, our payments offerings of $203 million, and Mailchimp of $125 million. Revenue increases were due to the interrelated factors described below. Online payroll revenue increased due to customer growth, higher effective prices, and a shift in mix to higher-end offerings. Online payments revenue increased due to customer growth, higher effective prices, and an increase in total payment volume per customer. Mailchimp revenue increased due to higher effective prices and paid customer growth. QuickBooks Online Accounting revenue increased $530 million, or 19%, in fiscal 2024 compared with fiscal 2023 due to customer growth, higher effective prices, and a shift in mix to our higher-priced offerings.
Online Ecosystem average revenue per customer, which we define as total online ecosystem revenue divided by the average number of online paying customers, increased 11% for fiscal 2024 compared with fiscal 2023. Online ecosystem paying customers, which we define as the sum of all QuickBooks Online customers, QuickBooks Time customers, Mailchimp paying customers, and customers who subscribe to standalone services outside of their QuickBooks Online experience, increased 6% as of July 31, 2024 compared with July 31, 2023.
Desktop Ecosystem
Desktop Ecosystem revenue increased $362 million, or 16%, in fiscal 2024 compared with fiscal 2023, $252 million of which is due to the interrelated factors of customer growth and price increases primarily in our QuickBooks Desktop and Enterprise subscription offerings. Approximately $110 million of fiscal 2024 revenue is associated with changes we made to our offerings in fiscal 2024 to complete the transition to a recurring subscription model, which more closely aligns our Desktop license and related product updates to our Desktop subscription billing model.
Small Business & Self-Employed segment operating income increased $1.2 billion, or 25%, in fiscal 2024 compared with fiscal 2023, due to the increase in revenue described above, which was partially offset by increases in marketing expenses of $105 million, staffing expenses of $67 million, and outside services expenses of $54 million.
In August 2023, we reorganized certain workplace and real estate functions that are now managed at the corporate level. As a result, these costs are no longer included in segment operating income and are now included in other corporate expenses. For the twelve months ended July 31, 2023 and 2022, we reclassified $49 million and $21 million, respectively, from Small Business & Self-Employed to other corporate expenses.
On August 1, 2024, we renamed our Small Business & Self-Employed segment as the Global Business Solutions segment. This new name better aligns with the global reach of the Mailchimp and QuickBooks platform, our focus on serving both small and mid-market businesses, and our vision to become the end-to-end platform that customers use to grow and run their business.
