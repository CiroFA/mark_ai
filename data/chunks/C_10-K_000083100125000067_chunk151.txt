not align with U.S. tax principles in significant part and for services performed outside the recipient country. In 2023, the IRS announced that the effective date of these regulations was deferred until the IRS gives notice otherwise. The impact on Citi’s effective tax rate is not expected to be material.

The Inflation Reduction Act was signed into law on August 16, 2022. The Act includes a new corporate alternative minimum tax (AMT) and a 1% excise tax on share repurchases, both effective January 1, 2023. The corporate AMT is a 15% minimum tax on financial statement income after adjusting for foreign taxes paid. Corporate AMT paid in one year is creditable against regular corporate tax liability in future years. Citi does not expect to pay material amounts of corporate AMT given its profitability and tax profile.
The 1% excise tax is a non-deductible tax on the fair market value of stock repurchased in the taxable year, reduced by the fair market value of any stock issued in the same year. See Note 11 for the 2024 impact on earnings per share related to the excise tax.
Deferred Tax Assets and Valuation Allowances (VA)
At December 31, 2024, Citi had net DTAs of $29.8 billion. In the fourth quarter of 2024, Citi’s DTAs decreased by $0.2 billion, primarily as a result of the geographic mix of earnings. On a full-year basis, Citi’s DTAs increased by $0.2 billion from $29.6 billion at December 31, 2023.
Of Citi’s total net DTAs of $29.8 billion as of December 31, 2024, $12.8 billion, primarily related to tax carry-forwards, was deducted in calculating Citi’s regulatory capital. Net DTAs arising from temporary differences are also deducted from regulatory capital if in excess of the 10%/15% limitations (see “Capital Resources” above). For the quarter and year ended December 31, 2024, Citi had $3.0 billion of disallowed temporary difference DTAs (included in the $12.8 billion above). The remaining $17.0 billion of net DTAs as of December 31, 2024 was not deducted in calculating regulatory capital pursuant to Basel III standards and was appropriately risk weighted under those rules.
Citi’s total VA at December 31, 2024 was $4.3 billion, an increase of $0.7 billion from $3.6 billion at December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily driven by the generation of current-year FTCs in the branch basket. Citi’s VA of $4.3 billion is composed of $3.3 billion on its FTC branch basket carry-forwards, $0.6 billion on its U.S. residual DTA related to its non-U.S. branches, $0.3 billion on local non-U.S. DTAs and $0.1 billion on state net operating loss carry-forwards.
As stated above with regard to the impact of non-U.S.
branches on Citi’s earnings, the level of branch pretax income, the local branch tax rate and the allocations of ODL and expenses for U.S. tax purposes to the branch basket are the
main factors in determining the branch VA. Additional ODL
was created in 2024 as a result of reduced taxable income.
