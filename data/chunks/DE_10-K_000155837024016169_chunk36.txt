24. LEASES
We are both a lessee and a lessor. We lease for our own use warehouse facilities, office space, production equipment, information technology equipment, and vehicles. The financial services operations lease equipment produced or sold by us and a limited amount of other equipment to retail customers. We determine if an arrangement is or contains a lease at the contract inception.
Lessee
The amounts of the lease liability and right of use asset are determined at lease commencement and are based on the present value of the lease payments over the lease term. The lease payments are discounted using our incremental borrowing rate since the rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable. We determine the incremental borrowing rate for each lease based on the lease term and the economic environment of the country where the asset will be used, adjusted as if the borrowings were collateralized. Leases with contractual periods greater than one year and that do not meet the finance lease criteria are classified as operating leases.
We have elected to combine lease and nonlease components, such as maintenance and utilities costs included in a lease contract, for all asset classes.
Leases with an initial term of one year or less are expensed on a straight-line basis over the lease term and recorded in short-term lease expense.
Variable lease expense includes warehouse facilities leases with payments based on utilization exceeding contractual minimum amounts and leases with
payments indexed to inflation when the index changes after lease commencement.
The lease expense by type consisted of the following:
