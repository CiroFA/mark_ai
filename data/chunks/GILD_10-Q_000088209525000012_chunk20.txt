Galapagos’ board of directors will step down upon the separation and Gilead will be entitled to nominate two directors to SpinCo’s board.
LEO Pharma
In January 2025, we entered into a strategic partnership with LEO Pharma A/S (“LEO Pharma”) to accelerate the development and commercialization of LEO Pharma’s small molecule oral signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 (“STAT6”) programs for the potential treatment of patients with inflammatory diseases. Gilead will have global rights to develop, manufacture, and commercialize the small molecule oral STAT6 program. LEO Pharma will have the option to potentially co-commercialize oral programs for dermatology outside the U.S. LEO Pharma will hold exclusive global rights to STAT6 topical formulations in dermatology. Upon closing of the agreement, we made a $
250
million upfront payment to LEO Pharma which was charged to Acquired in-process research and development expenses on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. In addition, LEO Pharma is eligible to receive up to approximately $
1.5
billion in additional milestone payments and may also receive tiered royalties on sales of oral STAT6 products.

Impairment Assessments
No indicators of impairment were noted for the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, except as described in “2024 Impairment” below.
