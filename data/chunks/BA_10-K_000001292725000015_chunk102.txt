of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company has recorded valuation allowances of $
7,837
and $
4,550
primarily for certain domestic deferred tax assets, and certain domestic net operating losses, tax credit and interest carryforwards. To measure the valuation allowance, the Company estimated in what year each of its deferred tax assets and liabilities would reverse using systematic and logical methods to estimate the reversal patterns. The valuation allowance results from not having sufficient income from deferred tax liability reversals in the appropriate future periods to support the realization of deferred tax assets.
During 2024, the Company increased the valuation allowance by $
3,287
, primarily due to tax credits and other carryforwards generated in 2024 that cannot be realized in 2024.
Until the Company generates sustained levels of profitability, additional valuation allowances may have to be recorded with corresponding adverse impacts on earnings and/or OCI.
In 2024, we determined that earnings from our non-U.S. subsidiaries are no longer considered to be indefinitely reinvested.

Federal income tax audits have been settled for all years prior to 2021. The Internal Revenue Service is expected to begin the 2021-2023 federal tax audit in the third quarter of 2025. We are also subject to examination in major state and international jurisdictions for the 2010-2023 tax years. We believe appropriate provisions for all outstanding tax issues have been made for all jurisdictions and all open years.
The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development has introduced Pillar Two model rules, which establish a new global minimum tax of 15%. While it is unlikely that the United States will adopt these rules, certain other countries in which we operate have enacted Pillar Two legislation commencing in 2024. Since we do not have significant operations in jurisdictions with tax rates below the 15% minimum, Pillar Two has not materially increased our global tax costs in 2024 and is not expected to be material in future periods. We will continue to monitor both US and international legislative developments related to Pillar Two to assess for any potential impacts.
