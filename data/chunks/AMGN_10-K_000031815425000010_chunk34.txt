innovative therapies and/or allow access to new technologies. The EU is currently undergoing a review and revision of its pharmaceutical legislation. Various proposals are under consideration with the EU Council, followed by a negotiation among the EU government to agree to a final law. Full implementation is not expected until 2027 or later. The new legislation, if implemented, will likely have a significant impact on the landscape for access and pricing decisions within EU Member States.
The dynamics and developments discussed above create pressures on the pricing and potential usage of our products and on the industry. Given the diverse interests in play between payers, biopharmaceutical manufacturers, policy makers, healthcare providers and independent organizations, if and whether the parties involved can achieve alignment on the matters discussed above remain unclear, and the outcome of any such alignment is difficult to predict. We remain focused on pricing our products responsibly and delivering breakthrough treatments for unmet medical needs. Amgen is committed to working with the entire healthcare community to ensure continued innovation and to facilitate patient access to needed medicines. We do this by:
•
investing billions of dollars annually in R&D;
•
pricing our medicines to reflect the value they provide;
•
developing more affordable therapeutic choices in the form of high-quality and reliably supplied biosimilars;
•
partnering with payers to share risk and accountability for health outcomes;
•
providing patient support and education programs;
•
helping patients in financial need access our medicines; and
•
working with policy makers, patients and other stakeholders to establish a sustainable healthcare system with access to affordable care and in which patients and their healthcare professionals are the primary decision makers.

Manufacturing, Distribution and Raw Materials
Manufacturing
We believe we are a leader in the manufacture of biologics and that our manufacturing capabilities represent a competitive advantage. The products we manufacture consist of both biologics and small molecule drugs. The majority of our products are biologics that are produced in living cells and that are inherently complex due to naturally occurring molecular variations. Highly specialized knowledge and extensive process and product characterization are required to transform laboratory-scale processes into reproducible commercial manufacturing processes. Further, our expertise in the manufacture of biologics has positioned us well for leadership in the global biosimilars market. For
