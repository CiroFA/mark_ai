to increases at NICO Primary, BH Direct and BHHC, partially offset by a 16.3% reduction at GUARD. The increases at NICO Primary and BHHC were primarily attributable to commercial auto coverage, while the increase at BH Direct reflected growth across several product lines. The decline at GUARD resulted from management’s decision to exit admitted homeowners’ insurance and to tighten underwriting guidelines in other lines of business.
Losses and loss adjustment expenses increased $1.4 billion (12.8%) and the loss ratio increased 2.1 percentage points in 2024 compared to 2023. Losses incurred included reductions of estimated ultimate losses for prior accident years’ claims of $52 million in 2024 and $537 million in 2023. The comparative decline reflected a significant increase in loss estimates at GUARD and lower reductions in estimated losses across several of our other businesses that write medical professional liability and commercial liability coverages, partially offset by increased reductions of property loss estimates. During 2024, due to deteriorating loss experience, management at GUARD performed a comprehensive review of claims and significantly increased estimated ultimate claim liabilities. The reduction of favorable development of prior years’ liability claims estimates across our other businesses was attributable to unfavorable social inflation trends, including the impacts of jury awards and litigation costs. Losses incurred from significant catastrophe events were approximately $350 million in 2024 and were minimal in 2023.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis
Insurance—Underwriting
Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group
Underwriting expenses increased $681 million (15.0%) and the expense ratio increased 1.3 percentage points to 27.8% in 2024 compared to 2023. The increase in the expense ratio was primarily attributable to BH Specialty from changes in business mix and GUARD due to increased expenses and lower premiums earned.
2023 versus 2022
Premiums written increased $3.5 billion (24.1%) in 2023 compared to 2022. The increase was primarily due to the acquisition of RSUI and CapSpecialty ($2.1 billion), as well as comparative increases from BHSI and BH Direct, and, to a lesser extent, the other businesses. Losses and loss adjustment expenses increased $1.3 billion (13.5%) in 2023 compared to 2022, attributable to the acquisition of RSUI and CapSpecialty and changes in business mix, partially offset by a decline in significant catastrophe losses of approximately $600 million. Net reductions in estimated ultimate liabilities for prior years’ loss events were $537 million in 2023 and $428 million in 2022.
Underwriting expenses increased $1.1 billion (30.8%) in 2023 compared to 2022. The increase was primarily attributable to the increases in premiums earned and changes in business mix, including the full year effects in 2023 of the acquisition of RSUI and CapSpecialty.
