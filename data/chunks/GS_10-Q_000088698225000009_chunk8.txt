102.81
billion as of March 2025 and $

billion as of December 2024, and receivables from brokers, dealers and clearing organizations of $

See Note 10 for further information about customer and other receivables accounted for at fair value under the fair value option. Interest on customer and other receivables is recognized over the life of the transaction and included in interest income.

4.19
billion as of March 2025 and $
