stock options under each acquired company’s respective stock plans, or we substituted substantially similar awards under the Plans. These restricted stock-based awards and stock options assumed or substituted generally retained all of the rights, terms and conditions of the respective plans under which they were originally granted. As of May 31, 2024, approximately
520,000
unvested RSUs and stock options to purchase approximately
257,000
shares of common stock, substantially all of which were vested, were outstanding under acquired company stock plans that Oracle assumed.
The 1993 Directors’ Stock Plan (the Directors’ Plan) provides for the issuance of RSUs and other stock-based awards, including non-qualified stock options, to non-employee directors. The Directors’ Plan has from time to time been amended and restated. Under the terms of the Directors’ Plan,
10
million shares of common stock are reserved for issuance (including a fiscal 2013 amendment to increase the number of shares of our common stock reserved for issuance by
2
million shares). Currently, we only grant RSUs that vest fully on the one-year anniversary of the date of grant. In fiscal 2016, the Directors’ Plan was amended to permit the Compensation Committee to determine the amount and form of automatic grants of stock awards, if any, to each non-employee director upon first becoming a director and thereafter on an annual basis, as well as automatic grants for chairing certain Board committees, subject to certain stockholder approved limitations set forth in the Directors’ Plan. In fiscal 2020, the Compensation Committee reduced the maximum value of the annual automatic RSU grants to each non-employee director to $
350,000
and eliminated all equity grants for chairing Board committees. As of May 31, 2024, approximately
36,000
unvested RSUs and stock options to purchase approximately
92,000
shares of common stock (all of which were vested) were outstanding under the Directors’ Plan. As of May 31, 2024, approximately
1
million shares were available for future stock awards under this plan.
The following table summarizes restricted stock-based award activity granted pursuant to Oracle-based stock plans for our last three fiscal years ended May 31, 2024:
The total grant date fair values of restricted stock-based awards that were vested and issued in fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022 were $
3.5
billion, $
2.9
billion and $
1.9
billion, respectively. As of May 31, 2024, total unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to non-vested restricted stock-based awards was $
8.6
billion and is expected to be recognized over the remaining weighted-average vesting period of
2.68
years.
