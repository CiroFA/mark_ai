During 2024, in accordance with our accounting policy to recognize actuarial gains and losses in the period in which they occur, we recorded a net pre-tax pension and benefits credit of $532 million in our pension and postretirement benefit plans. The net gain was recorded in Other income (expense), net in our consolidated statement of income and was primarily driven by:
•
a credit of $1.3 billion ($635 million for pension plans and $656 million for postretirement benefit plans) due to an increase in our discount rate assumption used to determine the current year liabilities of our plans from a weighted-average of 5.0% for both our pension and post retirement plans at December 31, 2023 to a weighted-average of 5.8% for our pension plans and 5.6% for our postretirement benefit plans at December 31, 2024;
•
a charge of $711 million due to the difference between our estimated and actual return on assets; and
•
a net charge of $48 million primarily due to other actuarial assumption adjustments.

•
a charge of $503 million ($288 million for pension plans and $215 million for postretirement benefit plans) due to a decrease in our discount rate assumption used to determine the current year liabilities of our plans from a weighted-average of 5.2% at December 31, 2022 to a weighted-average of 5.0% at December 31, 2023; and
•
a net credit of $45 million primarily due to other actuarial assumption adjustments, which includes the difference between our estimated and our actual return on plan assets.
