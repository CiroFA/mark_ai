at a relatively low cost. Some of our current and potential competitors include the largest global technology companies, which have significantly more customers or users, consumer data, and resources than we do, and may be able to leverage other aspects of their businesses (e.g., search or mobile device businesses, or Gen AI capabilities) to compete more effectively with us. For example, Google's online travel offerings have grown rapidly in this area by linking travel search services to its dominant search functionality through flight, hotel, and alternative accommodations meta-search products, and by integrating such products into its Google Maps app.
We currently, or may in the future, compete with a variety of companies, including:
•
online travel or restaurant reservation services and meta-search services;
3
•
large online search, social media, and marketplace companies;
•
travel service providers (e.g., accommodations, rental car companies, or airlines);
•
traditional travel agencies, travel management companies, wholesalers, tour operators, and financial institutions;
•
companies offering software solutions and technology services to travel service providers; and
•
companies offering AI agents powered by Gen AI via leveraging e.g., virtual assistants.

Government Regulation
Our business is affected by regulations of governments and regulatory authorities around the world, many of which are evolving and subject to revised and novel interpretations. Violations of laws or regulations could result in fines, penalties, and criminal sanctions against us, our officers or employees, and prohibitions on how or where we conduct our business. Even if we are compliant, doing business in certain jurisdictions or violations of these laws and regulations by the parties with which we conduct business risks harming our reputation and brands. Regulations that may impact us include:
•
Data Protection and Privacy
: We have policies and a governance framework to comply with privacy laws that apply to our business, meet evolving stakeholder expectations, and support innovation and growth. Regulations such as the EU's General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR"), the California Consumer Privacy Act (the "CCPA") and other comprehensive state consumer privacy laws impose significant compliance obligations and costs. Other jurisdictions have adopted or may adopt similar data protection regulations. Some of these laws afford consumers a private right of action against companies like ours for certain statutory violations.
•
Competition, Consumer Protection and Online Commerce
: Competition and consumer protection authorities are increasingly focused on large technology companies and the regulation of digital platforms.
