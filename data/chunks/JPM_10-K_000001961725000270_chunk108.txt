for client assets or funds becomes insolvent as a result of fraud or the failure to abide by existing laws and obligations, or where clients are unable to access assets held by JPMorganChase as custodian due to governmental actions or other factors.
A default by, or the financial or operational failure of, a CCP through which JPMorganChase executes contracts would require JPMorganChase to replace those contracts, thereby increasing its operational costs and potentially resulting in losses. In addition, JPMorganChase can be exposed to losses if a member of a CCP in which JPMorganChase is also a member defaults on its obligations to the CCP because of requirements that each member of the CCP absorb a portion of those losses. Furthermore, JPMorganChase can be subject to bearing its share of non-default losses incurred by a CCP, including losses from custodial, settlement or investment activities or due to cyber or other security breaches.
As part of its clearing services activities, JPMorganChase is exposed to the risk of nonperformance by its clients, which it seeks to mitigate by requiring clients to provide adequate collateral. JPMorganChase is also exposed to intra-day credit risk of its clients in connection with providing cash management, clearing, custodial and other transaction services to those clients. If a client for which JPMorganChase provides these services becomes bankrupt or insolvent, JPMorganChase may incur losses, become involved in disputes and litigation with one or more CCPs, the client’s bankruptcy estate and other creditors, or be subject to regulatory investigations. All of the foregoing events can increase JPMorganChase’s operational and litigation costs, and JPMorganChase may suffer losses to the extent that any collateral that it has received is insufficient to cover those losses.
Transactions with government entities, including national, state, provincial, municipal and local authorities, can expose JPMorganChase to enhanced sovereign, credit, operational and reputation risks. Government entities may, among other things, claim that actions taken by government officials were beyond the legal authority of those officials or repudiate transactions authorized by a previous incumbent government. These types of actions have in the past caused, and could in the future cause, JPMorganChase to suffer losses or hamper its ability to conduct business in the relevant jurisdiction.
In addition, local laws, rules and regulations could limit JPMorganChase’s ability to resolve disputes and litigation in the event of a counterparty default or unwillingness to make previously agreed-upon payments, which could subject JPMorganChase to losses.
Disputes may arise with counterparties to derivatives contracts with regard to the terms, the settlement procedures or the value of underlying collateral. The disposition of those disputes could cause JPMorganChase to incur unexpected transaction, operational and legal costs, or result in credit
