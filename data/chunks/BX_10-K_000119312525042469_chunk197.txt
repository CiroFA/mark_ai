Recent Accounting Developments
In June 2022, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued amended guidance addressing certain sale restrictions on equity securities measured at fair value. The guidance requires that reporting entities not consider contractual sale restrictions that prohibit the sale of equity securities when measuring fair value and introduces new disclosure requirements for equity securities subject to contractual sale restrictions. The new guidance was effective for Blackstone beginning January 1, 2024, was adopted on a prospective basis and did not result in a change in measurement of equity securities upon adoption. Related disclosures are included within the consolidated financial statements.
