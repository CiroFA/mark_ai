Equity
Earnings Per Share
–
The reconciliation of NEE's basic and diluted earnings per share attributable to NEE is as follows:
______________________
(a)
Calculated primarily using the treasury stock method. Performance share awards are included in diluted weighted-average number of common shares outstanding based upon what would be issued if the end of the reporting period was the end of the term of the award.
Common shares issuable pursuant to equity units, stock options, performance share awards and/or exchangeable notes, as well as restricted stock which were not included in the denominator above due to their antidilutive effect were approximately
33.9
million,
39.1
million and
38.1
million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
Common Stock Dividend Restrictions
– NEE's charter does not limit the dividends that may be paid on its common stock. FPL's mortgage securing FPL's first mortgage bonds contains provisions which, under certain conditions, restrict the payment of dividends and other distributions to NEE. These restrictions do not currently limit FPL's ability to pay dividends to NEE.
Stock-Based Compensation
– Net income for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 includes approximately $
138
million, $
139
million and $
142
million, respectively, of compensation costs and $
29
million, $
26
million and $
20
million, respectively, of income tax benefits related to stock-based compensation arrangements. Compensation cost capitalized for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 was not material. At December 31, 2024, there were approximately $
207
million of unrecognized compensation costs related to nonvested/nonexercisable stock-based compensation arrangements. These costs are expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of
2.0
years.
At December 31, 2024, approximately
68
million shares of common stock were authorized for awards to officers, employees and non-
