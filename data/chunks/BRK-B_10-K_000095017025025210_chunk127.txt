higher selling, general and administrative expenses.
2023 versus 2022
Revenues were $52.6 billion in 2023, a decline of $602 million (1.1%) compared to 2022. Revenues from the retail and restaurant businesses declined 0.8% and 2.2%, respectively, while revenues from the beverage business increased 1.9% compared to 2022. Retail and the restaurant business revenues were negatively affected in 2023 by lower unit volumes. Pre-tax earnings increased $184 million (67.9%) in 2023 compared to 2022. The increase reflected a slight increase in overall gross sales margin rates, increased other income and lower fuel expenses, partly offset by higher personnel expenses.
Non-Controlled Businesses
After-tax earnings of our non-controlled businesses include our proportionate share of earnings from our investments in Kraft Heinz, Occidental Petroleum (“Occidental”), Berkadia and Pilot through January 31, 2023. Earnings also included our 38.6% share of Pilot’s earnings for 2022 and for the month of January 2023.
After-tax earnings attributable to these businesses declined $231 million in 2024 compared to 2023, primarily due to lower earnings from Kraft Heinz ($137 million) and the inclusion of Pilot in January 2023 ($83 million). Earnings of non-controlled businesses increased $222 million in 2023 compared to 2022. The comparative increase was primarily due to increased earnings from Occidental, on which we adopted the equity method on August 4, 2022, and Kraft Heinz ($240 million), partially offset by decreased earnings from Pilot ($559 million). As of January 31, 2023, we discontinued using the equity method for our pre-existing 38.6% interest in Pilot upon acquiring a controlling interest in Pilot. In each year, our earnings from Kraft Heinz included the impacts of goodwill and intangible asset impairments recorded by Kraft Heinz.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis
Investment Gains (Losses)
A summary of investment gains (losses) follows (dollars in millions).
Unrealized gains and losses arising from changes in market prices of our investments in equity securities are included in our reported earnings, which significantly increases the volatility of our periodic net earnings due to the magnitude of our equity securities portfolio and the inherent volatility of equity securities prices. Unrealized gains and losses on our investments in equity securities also include the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on investments in non-U.S. issuers that are held by our U.S.-based subsidiaries.
Pre-tax investment gains and losses included net unrealized gains of $49.3 billion in 2024 and $69.1 billion in 2023 and net losses of $63.1 billion in 2022, attributable to changes in market prices during each year on equity securities we held at the end of each year. We also recorded pre-tax gains and losses from market value changes during each year on equity securities sold during the year, including net gains of $3.5 billion in 2024 and $2.7 billion in
