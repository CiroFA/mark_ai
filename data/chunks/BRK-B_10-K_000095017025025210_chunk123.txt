restaurants (Dairy Queen), lease transportation equipment (XTRA) and furniture (CORT), provide third party logistics services that primarily serve the petroleum and chemical industries (Charter Brokerage), distribute electronic news, multimedia and regulatory filings (Business Wire), provide various facilities construction management services (IPS-Integrated Project Services, LLC (IPS)) and operate a television station in Miami, Florida (WPLG).

2024 versus 2023
Service group revenues were $20.7 billion in 2024, a slight increase compared to 2023, reflecting revenue increases from aviation services businesses and IPS, partially offset by lower revenues from TTI and XTRA. Aviation services revenues increased 9.1% in 2024, while IPS revenues increased 14.4%. The aviation services increase was primarily due to an increase in the number of aircraft in shared aircraft ownership programs and increases in flight hours across NetJets’ various programs. The increase at IPS was primarily due to increased project volume.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis
Manufacturing, Service and Retailing
TTI revenues declined 10.0% in 2024 compared to 2023. Sales in 2024 declined across most regions, markets and product lines, attributable to excess inventory levels within supply chains, which contributed to lower sales volumes and pricing pressures. The decline at XTRA was due to fewer units on lease.
Service group pre-tax earnings declined 23.0% in 2024 compared to 2023, primarily attributable to TTI, the aviation services businesses and XTRA. Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues fell 3.4 percentage points in 2024 to 11.1% compared to 2023. Earnings from TTI declined 51.0% in 2024 compared to 2023, reflecting the impact of lower sales and price competition, which contributed to reduced gross sales margin rates, and higher selling, general and administrative expenses. Earnings from aviation services declined 10.9% in 2024 versus 2023, primarily attributable to increased costs of services and leasing, driven by higher flight crew, maintenance, fuel costs and depreciation expense, as well as increased impairment charges. The decline at XTRA was primarily due to lower revenues and increased costs.
2023 versus 2022
Revenues of the service group increased $1.6 billion (8.3%) in 2023 compared to 2022. IPS produced revenues of $1.3 billion in 2023 and $358 million for the post-acquisition period in 2022. Revenues from aviation services increased 11.5% in 2023 compared to 2022, primarily due to increases in the number of aircraft in shared aircraft ownership programs and in flight hours across NetJets’ various programs, as well as higher average rates.
Revenues from TTI declined 2.7% in 2023 compared to 2022. Excluding the effects of business acquisitions in 2022 and 2023 and favorable foreign currency translation effects,
