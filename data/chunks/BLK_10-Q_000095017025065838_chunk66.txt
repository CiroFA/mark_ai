Commercial Paper Program.
The Company may issue short-term unsecured commercial paper notes (the “CP Notes”) on a private-placement basis up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of $5 billion. The payments of the CP Notes have been unconditionally guaranteed by BlackRock Finance, Inc. (formerly known as BlackRock, Inc.) ("Old BlackRock") (the "CP Notes Guarantee"). The CP Notes will rank equal in right of payment with all of BlackRock's other unsubordinated indebtedness, and the obligations of Old BlackRock under the CP Notes Guarantee will rank equal in right of payment with all of Old BlackRock's other unsubordinated indebtedness. Net proceeds of issuances of the CP Notes are expected to be used for general corporate purposes. The commercial paper program is currently supported by the 2025 Credit Facility. At March 31, 2025, BlackRock had no CP Notes outstanding.
