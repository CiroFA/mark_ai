Equity Incentive Award Plans
2012 Plan
In connection with the acquisition of Broadcom Corporation, we assumed its 2012 stock incentive plan and outstanding unvested RSUs that were held by its employees. During the second quarter of fiscal year 2021, our stockholders approved the amendment and restatement of the Broadcom Corporation 2012 stock incentive plan, now called the Broadcom Inc. 2012 Stock Incentive Plan (the “2012 Plan”). Under the 2012 Plan, we may grant stock options and stock appreciation rights with an exercise price that is no less than the fair market value on the date of grant, restricted stock awards, and RSUs to employees. No participant may be granted such awards for more than an aggregate of
40
million shares in any fiscal year. Equity awards granted generally vest over
four years
. The 2012 Plan reduced the number of shares available for new equity award grants to
200
million shares and removed the annual share replenishment provision provided under the Broadcom Corporation 2012 stock incentive plan. During the second quarter of fiscal year 2023, our stockholders approved the amendment and restatement of the 2012 Plan to increase the number of shares of common stock authorized for issuance by
250
million shares. Awards cancelled or forfeited and shares withheld to satisfy tax withholding obligations become available for future issuance. As of November 3, 2024,
364
million shares remained available for issuance under the 2012 Plan.
We may grant market-based RSUs with both a service condition and a market condition as part of our equity compensation programs. The market-based RSUs generally vest over
four years
, subject to satisfaction of market conditions. During fiscal years 2024, 2023 and 2022, we granted market-based RSUs under which grantees may receive the number of shares ranging from
0
% to
300
% of the original grant on a stock split adjusted basis at vesting based upon the total stockholder return (“TSR”) on our common stock on an absolute basis and as compared to the TSR of an index group of companies. During fiscal year 2023, we also granted market-based RSUs vesting over
five years
, subject to satisfaction of stock price performance milestones.
