Fluctuations of the interest rate could also have a negative impact on interest expense related to our Loans payable and other financial liabilities, as a portion of these instruments is subject to variable interest rates. As of March 31, 2025, our Loans payable and other financial liabilities which accrue interest based on variable rates amounted to $4,451 million, while our Loans payable and other financial liabilities, which accrue interest based on fixed rates, amounted to $1,982 million. See Note 12 – Loans payable and other financial liabilities and Note 13 – Securitization transactions of our unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements for further detail. Considering a hypothetical increase of 100 basis points in the interest rates, the reported charge to the interim condensed consolidated statements of income for the three-month period ended March 31, 2025 would have increased by approximately $11 million with the impact in Cost of net revenues and financial expenses or in Interest expense and other financial losses. We have entered into swap and future contracts to hedge the interest rate fluctuation of $745 million notional amount, $634 million of which have been designated as hedging instruments. See Note 15 – Derivative instruments of our unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements for further detail on derivative instruments.
