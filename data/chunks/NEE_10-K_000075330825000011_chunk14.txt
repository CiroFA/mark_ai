including capacity associated with noncontrolling and joint venture interests
, at
December 31, 2024
;
•
ownership interests in solar facilities with a total net generating capacity of approximately 7,837 MW at
December 31, 2024
;
◦
essentially all MW are contracted solar facilities located primarily throughout the West and South regions of the U.S.;
◦
includes the impacts of approximately 2,507 MW of generating capacity added in the U.S. in 2024 and an ownership interest in assets sold to a third party totaling approximately 527 MW (see Note 1
