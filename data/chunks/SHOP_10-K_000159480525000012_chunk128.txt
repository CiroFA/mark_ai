During the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company identified leased office space for which it has ceased use.

These impairment charges were determined by comparing the asset groups' fair values made up of the right-of-use assets and leasehold improvements, to their carrying values as of the impairment measurement date, as required under ASC 360, Property, Plant and Equipment. Fair value was determined based on the present value of the estimated future cash flows. These charges were recorded as general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss). In the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company recorded impairment charges related to its operating lease right-of-use assets and leasehold improvements of $
