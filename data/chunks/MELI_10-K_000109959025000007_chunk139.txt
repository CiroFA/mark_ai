Brazilian Tax Reform
In December 2023 the Brazilian National Congress approved a  tax reform that will change the consumption taxation (goods and services), replacing ICMS (State tax) and ISS (Municipal tax) by IBS (Goods and Services Tax) and PIS/COFINS (Federal taxes) by CBS (Goods and Services Federal Tax). Overall, IBS and CBS will have a single flat rate, around 28% according to current studies, full non-cumulative system (taxpayer full entitlement to recover taxes paid in the previous transactions), and a 7-year transition, starting in 2026. Also, this change will simplify Brazilian tax legislation, which is expected to reduce tax litigation between taxpayers and the government.
In this regard, in January 2025, the first part of the regulation for the tax reform on consumption was approved. The text contains rules for the implementation of the CBS and IBS. For the CBS, the transition will be faster, starting in 2026 and ending in 2027. In contrast, the transition for the IBS will occur starting in 2029, with an end date in 2033.
