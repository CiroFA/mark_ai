Earnings per Share
The holders of our Class A and Class B common stock (together, "common stock") have identical liquidation and dividend rights but different voting rights. Accordingly, we present the earnings per share (EPS) for Class A and Class B common stock together.
Basic EPS is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of shares of our common stock outstanding. Diluted EPS is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of fully diluted common stock outstanding and assumes the conversion of our Class B common stock to Class A common stock.
Class A common stock equivalent of restricted stock units (RSUs) with anti-dilutive effect were not material for the year ended December 31, 2024. For the years ended December 31, 2023, and 2022, approximately
16
million and
95
million shares of RSUs were excluded from the diluted EPS calculation, respectively, as including them would have an anti-dilutive effect.
The numerators and denominators of the basic and diluted EPS computations for our common stock are calculated as follows (in millions, except per share amounts):
