reflecting higher materials costs and unfavorable business mix changes. These declines were partially offset by higher earnings in the Rail & Leasing, Medical, Water Technologies and Foodservice Technologies groups.
IMC’s revenues were approximately $3.9 billion in 2024, a decrease of 2.2% compared to 2023. The decline reflected lower organic sales attributable to sluggish customer demand across all major regions, and unfavorable foreign currency translation from a stronger U.S. Dollar, partially offset by the impact of business acquisitions and higher investment income. The decline in organic sales was attributable to weaker general economic conditions and ongoing geopolitical conflicts. IMC’s pre-tax earnings declined 7.8% in 2024 compared to 2023, primarily attributable to lower sales and gross margin rates and increased selling, general and administrative expenses, partially offset by higher investment and other income. IMC operates globally and a large portion of its products are manufactured in Israel. IMC’s operations in Israel have not been significantly impacted by the conflicts in the region.

Lubrizol’s revenues were $6.4 billion in 2023, a decline of 4.0% compared to 2022. The revenue decline was primarily due to a 7.9% decline in volumes and unfavorable foreign currency effects, partially offset by higher selling prices. Lubrizol’s pre-tax earnings in 2023 were relatively unchanged compared to 2022. Earnings included insurance recoveries of $11 million in 2023 and $242 million in 2022 in connection with fires at the Rockton, Illinois facility in 2021 and the Rouen, France facility in 2019. Excluding insurance recoveries, earnings in 2023 increased due to the favorable impacts of higher selling prices, favorable changes in product mix and lower raw material costs, partially offset by the impact of lower sales volumes, unfavorable foreign currency translation effects and higher operating expenses.
