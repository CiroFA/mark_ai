Global sales of
Varivax
(Varicella Virus Vaccine Live), a vaccine to help prevent chickenpox (varicella), declined 5% in the first quarter of 2025 primarily due to lower demand in the U.S. and declines in certain international markets, partially offset by higher pricing in the U.S. The Company has experienced manufacturing delays related to
ProQuad
and
Varivax
. As a result, the Company anticipates that some international markets will experience supply constraints during 2025.
Worldwide sales of
Vaxneuvance
(Pneumococcal 15-valent Conjugate Vaccine), a vaccine to help protect against invasive pneumococcal disease caused by certain serotypes, grew 5% in the first quarter of 2025 primarily due to continued uptake following launches in the pediatric indication in Europe and certain countries in the Asia Pacific region, partially offset by lower demand in the U.S. due to competitive pressure. Merck is a party to license agreements pursuant to which the Company pays royalties on sales of
Vaxneuvance
. Under the terms of the most significant of these agreements, Merck pays a royalty of 7.25% on net sales of
Vaxneuvance
through 2026; this royalty will decline to 2.5% on net sales from 2027 through 2035. The royalty expenses are included in

Sales of
Capvaxive
were $107 million in the first quarter of 2025 due to continued uptake following launch in the U.S. in the third quarter of 2024. In June 2024, the FDA approved
Capvaxive
for the prevention of invasive pneumococcal disease and pneumococcal pneumonia caused by certain serotypes in individuals 18 years of age and older. In March 2025, the EC approved
Capvaxive
. The timing of availability of
Capvaxive
in individual EU countries will depend on multiple factors including the completion of reimbursement procedures. The FDA and EC approvals were supported by results from the STRIDE clinical program, which evaluated
Capvaxive
in both vaccine-na√Øve and vaccine-experienced adult patient populations. Merck is a party to certain third-party license agreements pursuant to which the Company pays royalties on sales of
Capvaxive
. Under the terms of the most significant of these agreements, Merck pays a royalty of 7.25% on net sales of
Capvaxive
through 2026; this royalty will decline to 2.5% on net sales from 2027 through 2035. The royalty expenses are included in

Hospital Acute Care
Worldwide sales of
Bridion
(sugammadex), for the reversal of two types of neuromuscular blocking agents used during surgery, were nearly flat in the first quarter of 2025 as higher demand and pricing in the U.S. was offset by lower demand in several international markets due to generic competition, particularly in Japan and the EU. The patents that provided market exclusivity for
Bridion
in the EU and Japan expired in July 2023 and January 2024, respectively. Accordingly, the Company is experiencing sales declines of
Bridion
in these markets and expects the declines to continue.
