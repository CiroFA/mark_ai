payment of cash dividends. The declaration and payment of all dividends is subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on financial and legal requirements and other considerations. The amount available under the 2025 Stockholder Return Program for share repurchases will be reduced by the amount of any cash dividends declared and paid by us.
The 2025 Stockholder Return Program is the next step consistent with the Company’s capital allocation framework outlined at its recent Capital Markets Day. As discussed at Capital Markets Day, the Company expects its business plan to support approximately $80.0 billion in investments and capital returns between September 18, 2024, and the end of 2027. The Company currently plans to allocate such funds as follows:
•
Up to $50.0 billion for share repurchases and cash dividends, which includes the 2025 Stockholder Return Program;
•
Approximately $19.5 billion in a discretionary and flexible envelope for potential activities, which may include de-levering, investments in our core business, strategic investments, and/or additional capital returns to stockholders beyond the $50.0 billion initial allocation; and
•
Approximately $10.5 billion to complete pending transactions. See
