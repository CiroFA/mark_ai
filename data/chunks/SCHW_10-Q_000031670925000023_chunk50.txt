proceeds from the sale of shares. Concurrent with the completion of the secondary offering, and pursuant to a repurchase agreement dated February 9, 2025, the Company repurchased directly from TD Group US Holdings LLC its remaining 19.2 million shares of nonvoting common stock at a price of $77.982 per share for an aggregate repurchase amount of $1.5 billion, which settled on February 12, 2025. The shares of nonvoting common stock automatically converted into common stock upon repurchase and are now held in treasury stock, reducing the number of shares outstanding. These shares were purchased under CSC’s $15.0 billion share repurchase authorization. The share repurchase authorization does not have an expiration date and as of March 31, 2025, approximately $7.2 billion remained on the authorization. There were no repurchases of CSC’s common stock during the three months ended March 31, 2024.
Share repurchases, net of issuances, are subject to a nondeductible 1% excise tax which was recognized as a direct and incremental cost associated with these transactions. For repurchases of common stock, the tax is recorded as part of the cost basis of the treasury stock repurchased, resulting in no impact to the condensed consolidated statements of income.
Through the completion of the secondary offering and the Company’s repurchase of nonvoting common stock, TD Bank disposed of all of its common shares of CSC and the Company has no remaining nonvoting common stock outstanding. See Item 1 – Note 14 for additional information.
