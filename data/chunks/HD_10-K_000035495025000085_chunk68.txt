assumptions. We performed sensitivity analyses over the assumptions noted above used to determine the acquisition-date fair values of the customer relationships intangible assets to assess the impact changes in those assumptions would have on the Company’s determination of fair values. We evaluated forecasted revenues used by the Company by comparing to certain publicly available information for comparable companies, industry reports, and historical revenues achieved. We involved valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in evaluating the:
•
long-term forecasted revenue growth rates used by comparing to certain nationwide economic trend data such as GDP, inflation, and relevant industry data
•
expected customer attrition rates applied by testing management’s process to develop the attrition rate using historical revenue data
•
discount rate used in the valuations by comparing the inputs to the discount rate to publicly available market data for comparable entities.
Estimation of store shrink
As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the majority of the Company’s U.S. merchandise inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market as determined by the retail inventory method, which is based on a number of factors such as markups, markdowns, and inventory losses (or shrink). Shrink is the difference between the recorded amount of inventory and the physical inventory count. The Company calculates shrink based on actual inventory losses identified as a result of physical inventory counts during each fiscal period and estimated inventory losses occurring between physical inventory counts. The estimate for shrink occurring in the interim period between physical inventory counts is calculated on a store-specific basis and is primarily based on recent shrink results.
We identified the evaluation of the estimation of store shrink occurring in the period between physical inventory counts and fiscal year-end as a critical audit matter. Evaluating the Company’s estimation of shrink at the end of the fiscal year using interim inventory loss experience in U.S. retail stores involved auditor judgment.
The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the process of developing the estimate of store shrink. We evaluated the appropriateness of the Company using interim physical inventory counts to estimate inventory losses in U.S. retail stores at the end of the fiscal year by:
•
Evaluating the method and certain assumptions used;
•
Testing the application of the method and certain assumptions used;
•
Performing a current year trend analysis; and
•
Performing a sensitivity analysis over the shrink reserve estimate.
