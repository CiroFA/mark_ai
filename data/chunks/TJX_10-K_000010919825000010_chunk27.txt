afforded to the banners in some aspects of the business also increase the risk that our systems, controls, practices and policies may not be implemented effectively or consistently throughout our company, or that information may not be appropriately shared across our operations. The size and scale of our business also creates challenges in human resources administration and effectively managing, training, retaining and engaging a large, disparate workforce, including those with a remote or hybrid work arrangement. These challenges may increase if a portion of our workforce is unable to work on site or is temporarily furloughed, as has occurred in the past. If we are unable to manage our size and scale effectively, our results of operations may be adversely affected.
We source our merchandise globally, which subjects us to risks, including when moving merchandise internationally.
We are subject to various risks of sourcing merchandise, particularly from other countries, including risks related to moving merchandise internationally. Many of the products sold in our stores are sourced in locations (particularly in China, India and southeastern Asia) other than the location in which they will be sold. Where we are the importer of record, we may be subject to regulatory or other requirements, including those similar to requirements imposed upon the manufacturer of such products. Risks related to sourcing merchandise include:
–
potential disruptions in manufacturing and supply;
–
transport availability, capacity and costs;
–
tariffs, duties, border adjustment taxes, trade restrictions, sanctions, quotas and voluntary export restrictions on imported merchandise;
–
changes to international trade agreements or to trade agreement enforcement practices;
–
compliance with laws and regulations including labor, environmental, supply chain, international trade and other laws in relevant countries and those concerning ethical business practices;
–
problems with third-party distribution and warehousing, logistics, transportation and other supply chain interruptions;
–
information technology challenges;
–
strikes, threats of strikes and other events affecting delivery;
–
consumer perceptions of the safety or quality of imported merchandise;
–
compliance with product laws and regulations of the destination country;
–
product liability claims from customers or investigations, enforcement or penalties from government agencies relating to products that are recalled, defective or otherwise noncompliant or alleged to be harmful;
–
pandemics and epidemics (such as the COVID-19 pandemic) affecting sourcing, including manufacturing, buying or delivery;
–
intellectual property enforcement and infringement issues;
–
concerns about environmental impact where merchandise is produced or materials are sourced, including relating to greenhouse gas emissions, waste, water usage, deforestation, biodiversity and the impact of these activities on human health and local communities;
