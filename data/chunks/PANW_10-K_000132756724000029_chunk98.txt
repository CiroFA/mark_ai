Beginning in fiscal 2023, we were required to capitalize and amortize research and development expenses as required by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. As a result of this change and our increased profitability, we have paid significantly more U.S. cash taxes during fiscal 2024 and we expect our cash tax payments to increase in future periods.
DEBT
In June 2020, we issued the 2025 Notes with an aggregate principal amount of $2.0 billion. The 2025 Notes mature on June 1, 2025; however, under certain circumstances, holders may surrender their 2025 Notes for conversion prior to the maturity date. Upon conversion of the 2025 Notes, we will pay cash equal to the aggregate principal amount of the 2025 Notes to be converted, and, at our election, we will pay or deliver cash and/or shares of our common stock for the amount of our conversion obligation in excess of the aggregate principal amount of the 2025 Notes being converted. During fiscal 2024, we repaid in cash $1.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of the 2025 Notes and issued 7.0 million shares of common stock to the holders for the conversion value in excess of the principal amount of the 2025 Notes converted, which were fully offset by shares we received from our exercise of the associated note hedges. Subsequent to July 31, 2024, through the filing date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, $285.8 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2025 Notes was converted or had been submitted by the holders for conversion and will settle during the fiscal quarter ending October 31, 2024.
The sale price condition for the 2025 Notes was met during the fiscal quarter ended July 31, 2024, and as a result, holders may convert their 2025 Notes during the fiscal quarter ending October 31, 2024. If all of the holders convert their 2025 Notes during this period, we would be obligated to settle the $1.0 billion principal amount of the 2025 Notes in cash. We believe that our cash provided by operating activities, our existing cash, cash equivalents and investments, and existing sources of and access to financing will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs should the holders choose to convert their 2025 Notes during the fiscal quarter ending October 31, 2024 or hold the 2025 Notes until maturity on June 1, 2025. As of July 31, 2024, $1.0 billion of our 2025 Notes remained outstanding. Refer to Note 10. Debt in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information on the Notes.
In April 2023, we entered into a credit agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) that provides for a $400.0 million unsecured revolving credit
