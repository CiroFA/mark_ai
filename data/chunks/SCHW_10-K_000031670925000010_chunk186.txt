Asset Management and Administration Fees (AMAF) and Trading Revenue – Refer to Note 3 to the financial statements
Critical Audit Matter Description
Net revenues from the third-party mutual funds and managed investing solutions components of AMAF are generated through third-party mutual fund offerings, and fee-based managed investing solutions, respectively.
