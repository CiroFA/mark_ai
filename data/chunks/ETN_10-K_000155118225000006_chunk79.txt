Electrical Americas
The increase in organic sales in 2024 was due to strength in data center and commercial & institutional end-markets, partially offset by weakness in residential end-markets. The increase in organic sales in 2023 reflects strength in commercial & institutional, utility, industrial, machine OEM, and data center end-markets.
The operating margin increased from 26.5% in 2023 to 30.2% in 2024. Material factors affecting this increase were a 560 basis point increase from higher sales and a 150 basis point increase from operating efficiencies, partially offset by a 190 basis point decline from higher costs to support growth initiatives and a 130 basis point decline from higher commodity and wage inflation. The operating margin increased from 22.5% in 2022 to 26.5% in 2023 primarily due to higher sales volumes and net price realization, partially offset by higher costs to support growth initiatives, and higher gains from the sale of non-production facilities in 2022.
