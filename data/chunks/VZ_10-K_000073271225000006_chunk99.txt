maturities, and interest rate swap derivatives as of December 31, 2024 and 2023. The table also provides a sensitivity analysis of the estimated fair values of these financial instruments assuming 100-basis-point upward and downward shifts in the yield curve. Our sensitivity analysis does not include the fair values of our commercial paper and bank loans, if any, because they are not significantly affected by changes in market interest rates.
Interest Rate Swaps
We enter into interest rate swaps to achieve a targeted mix of fixed and variable rate debt. We principally receive fixed rates and pay variable rates, resulting in a net increase or decrease to Interest expense. These swaps are designated as fair value hedges and hedge against interest rate risk exposure of designated debt issuances. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the liability of these contracts was $5.3 billion and $4.5 billion, respectively. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the total notional amount of the interest rate swaps was $24.0 billion and $26.1 billion, respectively.
The functional currency for our foreign operations is primarily the local currency. The translation of income statement and balance sheet amounts of our foreign operations into U.S. dollars is recorded as cumulative translation adjustments, which are included in Accumulated other comprehensive loss in our consolidated balance sheets. Gains and losses on foreign currency transactions are recorded in the consolidated statements of income. At December 31, 2024, our primary translation exposure was to the British Pound Sterling, Euro, Australian Dollar and Swedish Krona.
Cross Currency Swaps
We have entered into cross currency swaps to exchange our British Pound Sterling, Euro, Swiss Franc, Canadian Dollar and Australian Dollar-denominated cash flows into U.S. dollars and to fix our cash payments in U.S. dollars, as well as to mitigate the impact of foreign currency transaction gains or losses. The fair value of the asset of these contracts was $500 million and $762 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the liability of these contracts was $2.7 billion and $2.1 billion, respectively. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the total notional amount of the cross currency swaps was $32.1 billion and $33.5 billion, respectively.
Foreign Exchange Forwards
We also have foreign exchange forwards which we use as an economic hedge but for which we have elected not to apply hedge accounting. We entered into British Pound Sterling and Euro foreign exchange forwards to mitigate our foreign exchange rate risk related to non-functional currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities of international subsidiaries.
At both December 31, 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the asset and liability of these contracts was insignificant. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the total notional amount of the foreign exchange forwards was $620 million and $1.1 billion,
