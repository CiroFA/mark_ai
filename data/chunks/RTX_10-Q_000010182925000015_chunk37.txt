We had the following net EAC adjustments for the periods presented:
Total net EAC adjustments in the quarter ended March 31, 2025 were relatively consistent with the quarter ended March 31, 2024.
Significant EAC adjustments, when they occur, are discussed in each business segment’s discussion below.
Backlog and Bookings.
Total backlog was $217 billion and $218 billion as of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively. Total backlog includes commercial backlog of $125 billion as of both March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, and defense backlog of $92 billion and $93 billion as of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively.
We believe bookings are an important measure of future performance for our defense businesses. Our defense operations consist primarily of our Raytheon business and operations in the defense businesses within our Collins and Pratt & Whitney segments. Defense bookings were approximately $9 billion and $11 billion for the quarters ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively.
Bookings are impacted by the timing and amounts of awards in a given period, which are subject to numerous factors, including: the desired capability by the customer and urgency of customer needs, customer budgets and other fiscal constraints, political and economic and other environmental factors, the timing of customer negotiations, and the timing of customer and governmental approvals and notifications. In addition, due to these factors, quarterly bookings tend to fluctuate from period to period, particularly on a segment basis.

A reconciliation of these measures to reported U.S. GAAP amounts is provided in the table above.
The organic net sales increase of $0.6 billion in the quarter ended March 31, 2025 compared to the quarter ended March 31, 2024 primarily relates to higher commercial aerospace aftermarket sales of $0.3 billion, higher defense sales of $0.2 billion, and a modest increase in commercial aerospace OEM sales. The increase in commercial aerospace sales was principally driven by continued growth in commercial air traffic, which has resulted in an increase in flight hours and increased volume. The increase in defense sales was primarily due to higher volume across multiple programs and platforms
.
The organic operating profit increase of $0.2 billion in the quarter ended March 31, 2025 compared to the quarter ended March 31, 2024 was primarily due to higher commercial aerospace operating profit of $0.2 billion, principally driven by the higher aftermarket sales volume discussed above. Defense operating profit increased $0.1 billion in the quarter ended
