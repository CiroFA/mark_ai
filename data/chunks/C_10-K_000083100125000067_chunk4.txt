DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
As described further throughout this Executive Summary, Citi demonstrated improved overall business performance and continued progress on its strategic priorities in 2024:
•
Citi and its five reportable operating segments each achieved positive operating leverage for 2024. Citi’s positive operating leverage in 2024 was driven by revenue growth of 3%, with record revenues in

, and disciplined expense management (down 4%), despite higher volume- and transformation-related expenses and other investments in risk and control initiatives. Excluding the impact of the FDIC special assessment in both 2024 and the prior year, expenses decreased 2%.
•
Citi continued to advance its transformation, including its efforts to improve risk management, modernize technology and infrastructure and improve resiliency across the organization. Simultaneously, as a result of the July 2024 Civil Money Penalty Consent Orders and Consent Order Amendment, Citi recognized the need to accelerate progress in certain areas, particularly with regard to data quality management related to governance and regulatory reporting. (See “Citi’s Multiyear Transformation” below).
•
Citi completed its organizational simplification announced in September 2023, resulting in a simpler management structure that aligns to and facilitates Citi’s strategy, while improving accountability and decision-making and advancing the execution of Citi’s transformation.
•
As part of its strategic refresh, Citi continued to make progress on its remaining divestitures, including exits of its consumer banking operations in Korea and Poland and its overall operations in Russia. Additionally, Citi completed the separation of its

businesses in Mexico from its consumer banking and small business and middle-market banking operations in Mexico (Mexico Consumer/SBMM) in December 2024, an important milestone toward the planned initial public offering (IPO) of Citi’s Mexico Consumer/SBMM business. (See “

(Managed Basis)” below.)
•
Citi returned $6.7 billion to common shareholders in the form of dividends ($4.2 billion) and share repurchases ($2.5 billion) in 2024. As previously disclosed, on January 13, 2025, Citigroup’s Board of Directors authorized a new, multiyear $20 billion common stock repurchase program, with planned repurchases of $1.5 billion during the first quarter of 2025, subject to market conditions and other factors. After the first quarter of 2025, Citi will continue to assess the level of common share repurchases on a quarter-by-quarter basis given uncertainty regarding regulatory capital requirements, among other factors.
