impact of changes in those key assumptions on the Company’s determination of the fair value of the IPR&D and developed technology rights, respectively. We evaluated the reasonableness of the Company’s forecasted revenue growth rates by comparing them to historical results, comparable products and peer companies, analyst expectations, industry related third-party data, and the assumptions used in prior periods. Further, we evaluated the PTRS rates for certain IPR&D assets by considering the phase of development of the clinical projects and the Company's history of obtaining regulatory approval and comparing them to PTRS rates derived from analyst reports and other industry related third-party data and the assumptions used in prior periods. We evaluated the data sources used by management in determining the key assumptions for certain IPR&D assets and developed technology rights by comparing to industry standards and evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. In addition, we involved valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in:
(1)  evaluating the discount rates used by the Company for certain IPR&D and developed technology rights by comparing them against discount rate ranges that were independently developed using publicly available market data for comparable entities
(2) testing the source information underlying the determination of the discount rates.
