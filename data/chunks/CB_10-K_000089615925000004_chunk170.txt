million in short-tail lines, primarily in property and marine lines, mainly in accident years 2019 through 2023, driven by favorable loss development across all regions and specific case reductions. Net favorable development in 2024 also included $
26
million in long-tail lines, primarily in financial lines due to favorable loss emergence in accident years 2019 and 2020.
Net favorable development in
2023 included
$
326
million in short-tail lines, primarily in property and marine lines, mainly in accident years 2020 through 2022, driven by favorable loss development across all regions, favorable catastrophe development in recent accident years, and specific case reductions. Net favorable development also included $
50
million in long-tail lines, primarily in professional lines, including cyber, driven by favorable loss development in the U.K. and Europe regions.
Corporate
.
Net adverse development in 2024, 2023, and 2022, included adverse development for asbestos, environmental, molestation claims and other exposures.
Molestation claims
Chubb's exposure to molestation claims principally arises out of liabilities acquired when it purchased CIGNA's P&C business in 1999, and Chubb Corp in 2016. The vast majority of the current liability relates to exposure from "reviver" legislation in certain states that allow civil claims relating to molestation to be asserted against policyholders that would otherwise be barred by statutes of limitations. These exposures are predominantly included in our inactive run-off operations included in Corporate with an immaterial amount in the North America Commercial P&C segment.
In December 2021, Chubb reached an agreement-in-principle regarding the bankruptcy of the Boy Scouts of America (BSA). Under this agreement, which remains contingent upon final court approval following exhaustion of all appeals, our inactive run-off company, Century Indemnity Company, and certain active Chubb companies obtained a broad release for all Chubb companies from BSA-related abuse claims for $
800
million. This agreement was approved by the bankruptcy court in the third quarter of 2022.
In the first quarter of 2023, the District Court issued an order approving the Boy Scouts of America (BSA) bankruptcy plan in full; however, appeals were subsequently filed. We paid
$
800
million
per the agreement, with
$
300
million
paid in 2022, and the remaining
$
500
million p
aid in 2023.
