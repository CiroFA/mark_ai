of December 31, 2024, the total estimated remaining unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested SVAs was $
61.4
million, which will be amortized over the weighted-average remaining requisite service period of
21
months.

Performance Award Program
PAs were granted to officers and management prior to 2024 and are payable in shares of our common stock. The number of PA shares actually issued, if any, varied depending on the achievement of certain pre-established earnings-per-share targets over a
two-year
period. PA shares were accounted for at fair value based upon the closing stock price on the date of grant and fully vest at the end of the measurement period. The fair values of PAs granted for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 were, $
335.86
and $
234.93
, respectively. Pursuant to this program, approximately
0.4
million,
0.5
million, and
0.7
million shares were issued during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. We expect to issue approximately
0.6
million shares in 2025. As of December 31, 2024, there was no remaining unrecognized compensation cost related to PAs, as we discontinued the program.
Relative Value Award Program
RVAs are granted to officers and management and are payable in shares of our common stock. The number of shares actually issued, if any, varies depending on the growth of our stock price at the end of the
three-year
vesting period compared to our peers. We measure the fair value of the RVA unit on the grant date using a Monte Carlo simulation model. The model utilizes multiple input variables that determine the probability of satisfying the market condition stipulated in the award grant and calculates the fair value of the award. Expected volatilities utilized in the model are based on implied volatilities from traded options on our stock, historical volatility of our stock price and our peers' stock price, and other factors. Similarly, the dividend yield is based on historical experience and our estimate of future dividend yields. The risk-free interest rate is derived from the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.
The weighted-average fair value of the RVA units granted during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 were $
1,106.40
, $
397.95
, and $
230.00
, respectively, determined using the following assumptions:
Pursuant to this program, approximately
0.1
million shares were issued during each of the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023. We expect to issue approximately
0.1
million shares in 2025. As of December 31, 2024, the total estimated remaining unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested RVAs was $
27.5
million, which will be amortized over the weighted-average remaining requisite service period of
22
months.
