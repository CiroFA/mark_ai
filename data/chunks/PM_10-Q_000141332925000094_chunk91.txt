U.S. GAAP Treatment of Highly Inflationary Economies
We apply highly inflationary accounting to the results of operations of our subsidiaries in Argentina, Egypt, Turkey and Lebanon as the cumulative inflation rate in these economies for a three-year period meets or exceeds 100%, in accordance with U.S. GAAP. As a result, monetary assets and liabilities denominated in local currencies are remeasured to the U.S. Dollar at each balance sheet date, with remeasurement gains and losses recognized in consolidated statement of earnings.

While the global tariff environment is volatile, as a global company with a broadly diversified production, a worldwide supplier network, including an established U.S. manufacturing base for nicotine pouches, and existing supply chains that are largely self-contained within their respective trade regions, we currently believe we are well-positioned to mitigate potential supply chain challenges and that the changing tariff environment will not
