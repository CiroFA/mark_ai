Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report for a summary of the amortized cost and fair value of our investments by type of issue.
Our cash equivalents and investments are subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates. Interest rate movements affect the interest income we earn on cash equivalents and investments and the value of those investments. At July 31, 2024, our cash equivalents and investments totaled $3.2 billion and had a weighted-average pre-tax yield of 5.185%. Total interest income for fiscal 2024 was $147 million. If the Federal Reserve Target Rate had increased by 25 basis points from the level of July 31, 2024, the value of our investments at that date would have decreased by approximately $1 million. If the Federal Reserve Target Rate had increased by 100 basis points from the level of July 31, 2024, the value of our investments at that date would have decreased by approximately $3 million.
In June 2020, we issued $2 billion of senior unsecured notes which was comprised of the following: $500 million of 0.650% notes due in July 2023, $500 million of 0.950% notes due in July 2025, $500 million of 1.350% notes due in July 2027, and $500 million of 1.650% notes due in July 2030 (together, the 2020 Notes). During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, we repaid the $500 million in notes due in July 2023 when they became due using cash from operations. We carry the 2020 Notes at face value, less unamortized discount and unamortized debt issuance costs on our consolidated balance sheets. Since these 2020 Notes bear interest at fixed rates, we have no financial statement risk associated with changes in interest rates. However, the fair value of the 2020 Notes fluctuates when interest rates change. See Note 2 and Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report for more information.
In September 2023, we issued $4 billion of senior unsecured notes, which was comprised of the following: $750 million of 5.250% notes due in September 2026, $750 million of 5.125% notes due in September 2028, $1,250 million of 5.200% notes due in September 2033, and $1,250 million of 5.500% notes due in September 2053 (together, the 2023 Notes). We carry the 2023 Notes at face value less unamortized discount and unamortized debt issuance costs on our consolidated balance sheets. Since these 2023 Notes bear interest at fixed rates, we have no financial statement risk associated with the changes in interest rates. However, the fair value of the 2023 Notes fluctuates when interest rates change. See Note 2 and Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report for more information.
