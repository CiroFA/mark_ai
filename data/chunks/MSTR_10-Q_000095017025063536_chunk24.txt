stated amount of $
100
per share (the “Strife Stated Amount”). Regular Strife Dividends are payable when, as and if declared by the Company’s board of directors, out of funds legally available for their payment, quarterly in arrears on March 31, June 30, September 30 and December 31 of each year, beginning on June 30, 2025 (each, a “Regular Strife Dividend Payment Date”). Declared Strife Regular Dividends on the Perpetual Strife Preferred Stock are payable solely in cash. If any accumulated Regular Strife Dividend (or any portion thereof) on the Perpetual Strife Preferred Stock is not paid on the applicable Regular Strife Dividend Payment Date (or, if such Regular Strife Dividend Payment Date is not a business day, the next business day), then additional Regular Strife Dividends (“Compounded Strife Dividends”) will accumulate on the amount of such unpaid Regular Strife Dividend, compounded quarterly at the Compounded Strife Dividend Rate (as defined below), from, and including, such Regular Strife Dividend Payment Date to, but excluding, the date the same, including all Compounded Strife Dividends thereon, is paid in full. The “Compounded Strife Dividend Rate” applicable to any unpaid Regular Strife Dividend that was due on a Regular Strife Dividend Payment Date (or, if such Regular Strife Dividend Payment Date is not a business day, the next business day) will initially be a rate per annum equal to the Regular Strife Dividend Rate plus 100 basis points; provided, however, that until such Regular Strife Dividend, together with Compounded Strife Dividends thereon, is paid in full, such Compounded Strife Dividend Rate will increase by 100 basis points per annum for each subsequent Regular Strife Dividend period, up to a maximum rate of
18
% per annum.
If the Company fails to declare a Regular Strife Dividend on or prior to the record date applicable to a Regular Strife Dividend Payment Date, such failure shall constitute the issuance of a notice of deferral. Upon issuance of such notice, the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts over the following 60-day period to sell class A common stock and/or other securities to raise proceeds in an amount sufficient to cover any deferred dividends that would have been due with respect to the applicable Regular Strife Dividend Payment Date, plus Compounded Strife Dividends thereon. In certain cases where the Company has not declared and paid accumulated Regular Strife Dividends in full on the Perpetual Strife Preferred Stock, then, subject to limited exceptions, the Company will be prohibited from declaring or paying dividends on or repurchasing any shares of Perpetual Strike Preferred Stock, class A common stock, class B common stock or other junior securities.
