2022 under this operating segment structure.
Europe:
Net revenues increased by 9.7%.  Net revenues, excluding currency and acquisitions, increased by 3.6%, reflecting: a favorable pricing variance, mainly driven by higher combustible tobacco pricing; partially offset by unfavorable volume/mix, mainly due to lower cigarette volume, as well as unfavorable cigarette mix, partly offset by higher HTU volume.
Operating income increased by 6.8%. Operating income, excluding currency and acquisitions, increased by 2.3%, primarily reflecting: lower charges in 2023 related to the war in Ukraine ($98 million), a favorable comparison to 2022 related to costs associated with the Swedish Match AB offer ($53 million) and a favorable pricing variance. The increase was partly offset by the 2023 charge related to the termination of a pledge agreement with the Foundation for a Smoke-Free World ($60 million), the 2023 charges for restructuring charges ($47 million), higher marketing, administration and research costs (mainly due to inflationary impacts and lower commercial investments in the prior year period); higher manufacturing costs (primarily due to inflationary impacts); and unfavorable volume/mix, mainly due to the same factors as for net revenues.
