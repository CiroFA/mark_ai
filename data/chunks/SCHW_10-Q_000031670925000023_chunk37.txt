support overall growth of the business. Professional services included acquisition and integration-related costs of $17 million in the first quarter of 2024.
Occupancy and equipment expense increased in the first quarter of 2025 compared to the same period in 2024, reflecting higher building expenses and technology equipment and software costs related to growth of the business. Occupancy and equipment included restructuring costs of $2 million in the first quarter of 2024.
Advertising and market development expense increased in the first quarter of 2025 compared to the same period in 2024, primarily due to higher client promotional spending.
Communications expense increased in the first quarter of 2025 compared to the same period in 2024, primarily as a result of higher exchange quotation services expenses.
Depreciation and amortization expense decreased in the first quarter of 2025 compared to the same period in 2024, primarily due to finance lease terminations in 2024 and lower depreciation on equipment due to abandonment of certain data centers in 2024 related to the integration of Ameritrade Holding LLC (Ameritrade Holding) and its consolidated subsidiaries (collectively, Ameritrade).

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)
Amortization of acquired intangible assets remained consistent in the first quarter of 2025 with the same period in 2024.
Regulatory fees and assessments decreased in the first quarter of 2025 compared to the same period in 2024. The decrease in the first quarter of 2025 was primarily due to a $25 million incremental FDIC special assessment in the first quarter of 2024 and lower FDIC deposit insurance assessments, reflecting a decrease in brokered CDs and a lower assessment base, compared to the first quarter of 2024.
Other expense increased in the first quarter of 2025 compared to the same period in 2024, primarily due to higher industry fees. Industry fees increased primarily due to higher SEC fee rates in effect during the first quarter of 2025 compared to the first quarter of 2024 and an increase in trading volumes. Subsequent to March 31, 2025, the SEC announced that effective May 14, 2025, it would decrease the fee rate applicable to most securities transactions to zero from the rate in effect since May 22, 2024. This change will result in lower industry fees in other expense and a corresponding decrease in other revenue after the effective date, resulting in no impact to net income.
Capital expenditures were $156 million and $122 million in the first quarter of 2025 and 2024, respectively. Capital expenditures increased in the first quarter of 2025 compared to the same period in 2024, primarily due to higher investment in purchased software and buildings, partially offset by lower internally developed software. We continue to anticipate capital expenditures for full-year 2025
