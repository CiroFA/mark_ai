driven by an increase in advertising demand, which we believe is mostly due to ongoing improvements to our ad performance from our ad targeting and measurement tools. This increase was partially offset by a higher number of ad impressions delivered, especially in geographies and in products, such as Reels, that monetize at lower rates. Other factors are discussed in the section entitled "—Executive Overview of First Quarter Results." In addition, the online commerce vertical was the largest contributor to the increase in advertising revenue in the three months ended March 31, 2025 compared to the same period in 2024. We anticipate that future advertising revenue will be driven by a combination of price and ad impressions delivered.
Other revenue
FoA other revenue in the three months ended March 31, 2025 increased $130 million, or 34%, compared to the same period in 2024. The increase was mostly driven by revenue from WhatsApp Business Platform and Meta Verified subscriptions.
Reality Labs
RL revenue in the three months ended March 31, 2025 decreased $28 million, or 6%, compared to the same period in 2024. The decrease in RL revenue was driven by a net decrease in Meta Quest sales, partially offset by an increase in sales of Ray-Ban Meta AI glasses.
Foreign Exchange Impact on Revenue
Changes in foreign exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on our revenue in the three months ended March 31, 2025 compared to the same period in 2024. To calculate revenue on a constant currency basis, we translated revenue using the prior year's monthly exchange rates for our settlement or billing currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Using these constant rates for the three months ended March 31, 2025, our total revenue and advertising revenue would have been $43.55 billion and $42.62 billion, which were $1.24 billion and $1.22 billion higher than actual total revenue and advertising revenue, respectively.

Cost of revenue
Cost of revenue in the three months ended March 31, 2025 increased $932 million, or 14%, compared to the same period in 2024. The increase was mainly due to higher operational expenses related to our data centers and technical infrastructure, which included a decrease in the depreciation growth rate due to an extension in the useful lives of servers and network assets, effective January 1, 2025. To a lesser extent, higher costs associated with partner arrangements also contributed to the increase in the three months ended March 31, 2025.
