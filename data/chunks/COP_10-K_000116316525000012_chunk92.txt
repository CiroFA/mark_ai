for the emissions that are within our control, we are progressing toward our Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions intensity targets.
Key elements of the Climate Risk Strategy include:
•
Strategic flexibility and portfolio composition
◦
Building a resilient asset portfolio with a focus on low cost of supply and low GHG intensity to meet global energy demand.
◦
Committing to capital discipline through use of a fully burdened cost of supply, including cost of carbon, as the basis for capital allocation.
◦
Testing our portfolio against future energy demand scenarios through a comprehensive scenario planning process that helps us assess the resilience of our corporate strategy to climate risk.
•
Scope 1 and 2 emissions targets and reductions
◦
Setting targets for emissions over which we have ownership and control.
◦
Reducing emissions through the marginal abatement cost curve process.
•
LNG and technology
◦
Building an attractive LNG portfolio as an important component of responsibly meeting global energy demand due to LNG's opportunity to displace higher-emissions fuels such as coal for electricity generation.
◦
Evaluating potential investments in emerging alternative energy sources and low-carbon technologies.
•
External engagement
◦
Advocating for a well-designed, economy-wide price on carbon and engaging in development of other policy and legislation to address end-use emissions.
◦
Working with our suppliers and commercial partners to reduce emissions along the value chain.
Our Climate Risk Strategy does not include a Scope 3 emissions target. We recognize that end-use emissions must be reduced to meet global climate objectives. However, it is our view that supply-side constraints through Scope 3 targets for North American and European upstream oil and gas producers would be counterproductive to climate goals. In the absence of policy measures that address global demand, Scope 3 targets would shift production to other global operators, potentially eroding energy security and increasing emissions. This is why we have consistently taken a prominent role in advocating for a well-designed, economy wide price on carbon and engaged in development of other policies or legislation that could address end-use emissions from high-carbon intensity energy use. We have also expanded policy advocacy beyond carbon pricing to include energy efficiency, end-use emissions policy and regulatory action, such as support for the direct federal regulation of methane.
In support of addressing our Scope 1 and 2 emissions, we have made recent progress in several key areas.
•
Completed our 2024 scope 1 and 2 emissions reduction projects within the allotted capital and cost budget. These projects will support our GHG emissions intensity reduction target of 50-60 percent by 2030 from a 2016 baseline for both gross operated and net equity emissions.
