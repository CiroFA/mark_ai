poor business conditions for our customers, causing them to delay software purchases;
•
reluctance of customers to purchase proprietary software products;

reluctance of our customers to purchase products hosted by our vendors and/or service interruption from such providers;

reluctance of customers to purchase products incorporating generative AI; and
•
reluctance of customers to purchase products incorporating open source software.
If we are not able to continue to identify challenges faced by our customers and develop, license, or acquire new features and capabilities to our platforms in a timely and cost-effective manner, or if such enhancements do not achieve market acceptance, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects may suffer and our anticipated revenue growth may not be achieved.
Because we derive, and expect to continue to derive, substantially all of our revenue from customers purchasing our platforms and products, market acceptance of these platforms and products, and any enhancements or changes thereto, is critical to our success.
The competitive position of our platforms depends in part on their ability to operate with third-party products and services, and if we are not successful in maintaining and expanding the compatibility of our platforms with such third-party products and services, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely impacted.
The competitive position of our platforms depends in part on their ability to operate with products and services of third parties, software services, and infrastructure in connection with our work in the public and commercial sectors, including but not limited to, our joint ventures, channel sales relationships, platform partnerships, strategic alliances, and other similar arrangements where applicable. As such, we must continuously modify and enhance our platforms to adapt to changes in, or to be integrated or otherwise compatible with, hardware, software, networking, browser, and database technologies. In the future, one or more companies may choose not to support the operation of their hardware, software, or infrastructure, or our platforms may not support the capabilities needed to operate with such hardware, software, or infrastructure. In addition, to the extent that a third party were to develop software or services that compete with ours, that provider may choose not to support one or more of our platforms. We intend to facilitate the compatibility of our platforms with various third-party hardware, software, and infrastructure by maintaining and expanding our business and technical relationships. For example, in March 2024, we were selected by the U.S. Army to develop and deliver the Tactical Intelligence Targeting Access Node ground station system, the Army’s first AI-defined vehicle, which will involve coordination with third parties such as hardware
