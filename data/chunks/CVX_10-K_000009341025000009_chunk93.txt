Note 19
Short-Term Debt
Redeemable long-term obligations consist primarily of tax-exempt variable-rate put bonds that are included as current liabilities because they become redeemable at the option of the bondholders during the year following the balance sheet date.
The company may periodically enter into interest rate swaps on a portion of its short-term debt. At December 31, 2024, the company had no interest rate swaps on short-term debt.
