Operating Leases
We lease various offices and data centers in North America, Europe, Asia and Australia under non-cancellable operating lease arrangements that expire on various dates through 2031. Some of our leases include options to extend the term of such leases for a period from
three months
to up to
10
years and/or options to early terminate the leases. As of December 31, 2024, we did not include any such options in determining the lease terms because we were not reasonably certain that we would exercise these options.

Purchase Commitments
We outsource most of our manufacturing and supply chain management operations to third-party contract manufacturers, who procure components and assemble products on our behalf. A significant portion of our purchase orders to our contract manufacturers for finished products consists of non-cancellable purchase commitments. In addition, we purchase strategic component inventory from certain suppliers under non-cancellable purchase commitments, including integrated circuits, which are consigned to our contract manufacturers. As of December 31, 2024, we had non-cancellable purchase commitments not recorded on our balance sheet of $
3.1
billion, of wh
ich $
2.8
billion have confirmed receipt dates
within 12 months, and
$
0.3
billion
have
confirmed receipt dates greater than 12 months
.
These open purchase orders are considered enforceable and legally binding, and while we may have some limited
ability to reschedule, and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to the delivery of goods or performance of services, this can only occur with the agreement of the related supplier.
We also had deposits to our contract manufacturers to secure our purchase commitments in the amount of $
