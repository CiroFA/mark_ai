an investigational trophoblast cell-surface antigen 2 (TROP2)-directed ADC, being developed as part of a collaboration with Kelun-Biotech for breast, cervical, endometrial, gastric and non-small-cell lung cancers.
Additionally, the Company currently has candidates in Phase 3 clinical development in several other therapeutic areas:
•
MK-3000, an investigational, potentially first-in-class tetravalent, tri-specific antibody that acts as an agonist of the Wingless-related integration site signaling pathway, for the treatment of diabetic macular edema and neovascular age-related macular degeneration;
•
MK-8591A, a once-daily oral combination of doravirine and islatravir, an investigational nucleoside reverse transcriptase translocation inhibitor, for the treatment of HIV-1 infection (which is on partial clinical hold for higher doses of islatravir than those used in current clinical trials);
•
MK-8591D, islatravir in combination with lenacapavir for the treatment of HIV-1 infection (which is on partial clinical hold for higher doses of islatravir than those used in current clinical trials), being developed in collaboration with Gilead Sciences Inc.;
•
MK-0616, enlicitide decanoate, an investigational, oral proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitor for hypercholesterolemia, including in studies evaluating low-density lipoprotein cholesterol reduction and a cardiovascular outcomes study;
•
MK-7240, tulisokibart, a humanized monoclonal antibody directed to tumor necrosis factor-like ligand 1A, a target associated with both intestinal inflammation and fibrosis, for Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis; and
•
MK-4482,

, which is reflected in Phase 3 development in the U.S. as it remains investigational following Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) in 2021.
Merck’s capital allocation strategy continues to prioritize investments in its business to drive near- and long-term growth, including investing in the Company’s key growth drivers and expansive pipeline of novel candidates, each of which has potential to address important unmet medical needs. Research and development expenses in 2024 reflect increased development spending particularly in the therapeutic areas of oncology, immunology and cardiometabolic. In addition, Merck remains committed to its dividend and will continue to pursue the most compelling external science and technologies through value-enhancing business development transactions.
In November 2024, Merck’s Board of Directors approved an increase to the Company’s quarterly dividend, raising it to $0.81 per share from $0.77 per share on the Company’s outstanding common stock. During 2024, the Company returned $9.1 billion to shareholders through dividends of $7.8 billion and share repurchases of $1.3 billion. In January 2025, Merck’s Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program of up to an additional $10 billion of Merck’s common stock for its treasury.
