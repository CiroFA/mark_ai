During 2024, we sold our seller financing loan portfolio (included within Platform Solutions). This portfolio consisted of loans that were extended to small- and medium-sized retailers.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis
The table below presents the impact to pre-tax earnings of the items that we sold or have announced the decision to sell (with respect to the narrowing of our focus on consumer-related activities).
In the table above, pre-tax earnings related to GreenSky, the GM credit card program and the seller financing loan portfolio were included within Platform Solutions.
We have the following remaining consumer-related activities within Platform Solutions:
•
We issue credit cards to and raise deposits from Apple Card customers.
•
We will continue to support existing GM customers and issue credit cards to new GM customers until the transition of the GM credit card program to another issuer is completed.
Future decisions we may make in connection with the narrowing of our focus on consumer-related activities could have a material impact on our results of operations in the period such decisions are made.
See “Results of Operations — Platform Solutions” for the drivers of changes in our net revenues for Consumer platforms.

•
Entering into interest rate, foreign currency, equity, commodity and credit derivatives, including total return swaps; and
•

We enter into these arrangements for a variety of business purposes, including securitizations. The securitization vehicles that purchase mortgages, corporate bonds and other types of financial assets are critical to the functioning of several significant investor markets, including the mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities markets, since they offer investors access to specific cash flows and risks created through the securitization process.
We also enter into these arrangements to underwrite client securitization transactions; provide secondary market liquidity; make investments in performing and nonperforming debt, distressed loans, power-related assets, equity securities, real estate and other assets; and provide investors with credit-linked and
