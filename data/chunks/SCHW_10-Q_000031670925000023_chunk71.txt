Stockholders’ Equity
On February 12, 2025, TD Group US Holdings LLC, an affiliate of TD Bank, completed a secondary public offering of the Company’s common shares through which TD Group US Holdings sold
133.8
million shares of the Company’s common stock and
31.7
million shares of the Company’s nonvoting common stock, which automatically converted into common stock. The offering was completed at a price of $
79.25
per share, for an aggregate amount of $
13.1
billion. The Company did not receive any of the proceeds from this sale.
Concurrent with the completion of the secondary offering, and pursuant to a repurchase agreement dated February 9, 2025, the Company repurchased directly from TD Group US Holdings LLC its remaining
19.2
million shares of nonvoting common stock at a price of $
77.982
per share for an aggregate repurchase amount of $
1.5
billion, which settled on February 12, 2025. The shares of nonvoting common stock automatically converted into common stock upon repurchase and are now held in treasury stock, reducing the number of shares outstanding. These shares were purchased under CSC’s $
15.0
billion share repurchase authorization. The share repurchase authorization does not have an expiration date and as of March 31, 2025, approximately $
7.2
billion remained on the authorization. There were
no
repurchases of CSC’s common stock during the three months ended March 31, 2024.
Share repurchases, net of issuances, are subject to a nondeductible excise tax which was recognized as a direct and incremental cost associated with these transactions. For repurchases of common stock, the tax is recorded as part of the cost basis of the treasury stock repurchased, resulting in no impact to the condensed consolidated statements of income.
Through the completion of the secondary offering and the Company’s repurchase of nonvoting common stock, TD Bank disposed of all of its common shares of CSC and as of March 31, 2025, the Company has
no
remaining nonvoting common stock outstanding.
