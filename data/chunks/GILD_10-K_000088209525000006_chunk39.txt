face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates. Overall, we are a net receiver of foreign currencies, and therefore, we benefit from a weaker U.S. dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger U.S. dollar. Our hedging program does not eliminate our exposure to currency fluctuations. We may be adversely impacted if the U.S. dollar appreciates significantly against certain currencies and our hedging program does not sufficiently offset the effects of such appreciation. For example, see “Foreign Currency Exchange Impact” in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of our exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily in the Euro, and the impacts from foreign currency exchange, net of hedges, for the year ended December 31, 2024.

Interest Rates and Inflation: We have interest-generating assets and interest-bearing liabilities, including our senior unsecured notes and credit facilities. Fluctuations in interest rates could expose us to increased financial risk. In addition, high inflation, such as what we have seen in recent years, has adversely impacted and may in the future adversely impact our business and financial results.
•
Anti-Bribery: We are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws that govern our international operations with respect to payments to government officials. Our international operations are heavily regulated and require significant interaction with foreign officials. We operate in parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree. In certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices or may require us to interact with doctors and hospitals, some of which may be state-controlled, in a manner that is different than local custom. It is possible that certain of our practices may be challenged under these laws. In addition, our internal control policies and procedures may not protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees and agents. Enforcement activities under anti-bribery laws could subject us to administrative and legal proceedings and actions, which could result in civil and criminal sanctions, including monetary penalties and exclusion from healthcare programs.
Other risks inherent in conducting a global business include:

Restrictive government actions against our intellectual property and other assets such as nationalization, expropriation, the imposition of compulsory licenses or similar actions, including waiver of intellectual property protections.

•
Changes in economic policies by the U.S. or foreign governments, which may result in trade protection measures, such as new or increased sanctions, tariffs, embargoes, import and export licensing requirements or other trade restrictions, or the threat of such restrictions.
