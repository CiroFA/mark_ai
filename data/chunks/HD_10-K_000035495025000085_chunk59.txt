Interest and Other, net
Interest and other, net increased $355 million, or 20.1%, to $2.1 billion in fiscal 2024. As a percent of net sales, interest and other, net, was 1.3% in fiscal 2024 compared to 1.2% in fiscal 2023, primarily due to higher interest expense driven by higher long-term debt.
Provision for Income Taxes
Our combined effective income tax rate was 23.7% in fiscal 2024 compared to 24.0% in fiscal 2023.

Diluted Earnings per Share
Diluted earnings per share were $14.91 in fiscal 2024 compared to $15.11 in fiscal 2023. The decrease in diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2024 was primarily driven by lower net earnings during fiscal 2024, partially offset by lower diluted shares. The 53rd week increased diluted earnings per share by approximately $0.30 for fiscal 2024.
NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
To provide clarity on our operating performance, we supplement our reporting with certain non-GAAP financial measures. However, this supplemental information should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related GAAP measures.

Return on Invested Capital
We believe ROIC is meaningful for management, investors and ratings agencies because it measures how effectively we deploy our capital base. ROIC is a non-GAAP profitability measure, not a measure of financial performance under GAAP. We define ROIC as NOPAT, a non-GAAP financial measure, for the most recent twelve-month period, divided by average debt and equity. We define average debt and equity as the average of beginning and ending long-term debt (including current installments) and equity for the most recent twelve-month period.
The following table presents the calculation of ROIC, together with a reconciliation of NOPAT to net earnings (the most comparable GAAP financial measure):

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
At February 2, 2025, we had $1.7 billion in cash and cash equivalents, of which $1.1 billion was held by our foreign subsidiaries. We believe that our current cash position, cash flow generated from operations, funds available from our commercial paper program, and access to the long-term debt capital markets should be sufficient not only for our operating requirements, any required debt payments, and satisfaction of other contractual obligations, but also to enable us to invest in the business, fund dividend payments, and fund any share repurchases through the next several fiscal years. In addition, we believe we have the ability to obtain
