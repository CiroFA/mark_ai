C. Obligations and Funded Status
(a)
For the U.S. pension plans, the benefit obligation is both the PBO and ABO as these plans are frozen and future benefit accruals no longer increase with future compensation increases. For the international pension plans, the benefit obligation is the PBO. The ABO for our international pension plans was $
7.1

7.0
billion in 2023. For the postretirement plans, the benefit obligation is the ABO.
