which vary based on the type of instrument. Estimating the fair value of level 3 financial instruments requires judgments to be made. These judgments include:
•
Determining the appropriate valuation methodology and/or model for each type of level 3 financial instrument;
•
Determining model inputs based on an evaluation of all relevant empirical market data, including prices evidenced by market transactions, interest rates, credit spreads, volatilities and correlations; and
•
Determining appropriate valuation adjustments, including those related to illiquidity or counterparty credit quality.
Regardless of the methodology, valuation inputs and assumptions are only changed when corroborated by substantive evidence.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis
Controls Over Valuation of Financial Instruments.
Market makers and investment professionals in our revenue-producing units are responsible for pricing our financial instruments. Our control infrastructure is independent of the revenue-producing units and is fundamental to ensuring that all of our financial instruments are appropriately valued at market-clearing levels. In the event that there is a difference of opinion in situations where estimating the fair value of financial instruments requires judgment (e.g., calibration to market comparables or trade comparison, as described below), the final valuation decision is made by senior managers in our independent price verification function within Controllers. This independent price verification is critical to ensuring that our financial instruments are properly valued.
Price Verification.
All financial instruments at fair value classified in levels 1, 2 and 3 of the fair value hierarchy are subject to our independent price verification process. The objective of price verification is to have an informed and independent opinion with regard to the valuation of financial instruments under review. Instruments that have one or more significant inputs which cannot be corroborated by external market data are classified in level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. Price verification strategies utilized by our independent price verification function within Controllers include:
•
Trade Comparison.
Analysis of trade data (both internal and external, where available) is used to determine the most relevant pricing inputs and valuations.
•
External Price Comparison.
Valuations and prices are compared to pricing data obtained from third parties (e.g., brokers or dealers, S&P Global Services, Bloomberg, ICE Data Services, Pricing Direct, TRACE). Data obtained from various sources is compared to ensure consistency and validity. When broker or dealer quotations or third-party pricing vendors are used for valuation or price verification, greater priority is generally given to executable quotations.
•
Calibration to Market Comparables.
Market-based transactions are used to corroborate the valuation of positions with similar
