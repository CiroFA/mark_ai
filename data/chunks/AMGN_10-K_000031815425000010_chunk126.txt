term loan credit agreement, which provided for borrowings in the aggregate of $28.5 billion. During 2023, we issued $24.0 billion of debt composed of eight series of notes, terminated the bridge credit agreement and borrowed $4.0 billion under the term loan credit agreement, of which $1.8 billion of borrowings was outstanding as of December 31, 2024.

During 2024, debt repayments totaled $3.6 billion, of which $2.2 billion was composed of repayments on our term loans. During 2023, debt repayments totaled $1.5 billion, and we had no debt repayments in 2022. In addition, we opportunistically repurchase our debt when market conditions are favorable. During 2024, 2023 and 2022, we repurchased aggregate principal amounts of our debt of $875 million, $881 million and $378 million, respectively, for aggregate costs of $659 million, $647 million and $297 million, respectively, which resulted in the recognition of gains on extinguishment of debt of $215 million, $225 million and $78 million, respectively, recorded in Other income (expense), net in the Consolidated Statements of Income.
To achieve a desired mix of fixed-rate and floating-rate debt, we entered into interest rate swap contracts that effectively converted a fixed-rate interest coupon for certain of our debt issuances to a floating, SOFR-based coupon over the terms of the respective notes. These interest rate swap contracts qualify and are designated as fair value hedges. As of both December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had interest rate swap contracts with an aggregate notional amount of $6.7 billion.
To hedge our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with certain of our long-term notes denominated in foreign currencies, we entered into cross-currency swap contracts, which effectively convert the interest payments and principal repayment of the respective notes from euros, pounds sterling and Swiss francs to U.S. dollars. These cross-currency swap contracts qualify and are designated as cash flow hedges. As of both December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had cross-currency swap contracts with an aggregate notional amount of $2.7 billion.
As of December 31, 2024, our commercial paper program allows us to issue up to $2.5 billion of unsecured commercial paper to fund our working capital needs. During 2024, 2023 and 2022, we did not issue any commercial paper. No commercial paper was outstanding as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.

The commitments under the revolving credit agreement may be increased by up to $1.25 billion with the agreement of the banks. Each bank that is a party to the agreement has an initial commitment term of five years. This term may be extended for up to two
