Software Development Costs
We incur software development costs related to products to be sold, leased, or marketed to external users, internal-use software, and our websites. Software development costs capitalized were not significant for the years presented. All other costs, including those related to design or maintenance, are expensed as incurred.
Property and Equipment, Net
Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Incentives that we receive from property and equipment vendors are recorded as a reduction to our costs. Property includes buildings and land that we own, along with property we have acquired under build-to-suit lease arrangements when we have control over the building during the construction period and finance lease arrangements. Equipment includes assets such as servers and networking equipment, heavy equipment, and other fulfillment equipment. Depreciation and amortization is recorded on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets (generally the lesser of

Assets acquired under finance leases are recorded in “Property and equipment, net.” All other leases are categorized as operating leases. Our leases generally have terms that range from

ten years
for equipment and
one

for property.
Certain lease contracts include obligations to pay for other services, such as operations and maintenance. For leases of
