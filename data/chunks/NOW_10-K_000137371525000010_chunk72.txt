repurchased 0.8 million shares of our common stock for $696 million. All repurchases were made in open market transactions. Repurchases of common stock are recognized as treasury stock and held for future issuance. As of December 31, 2024, approximately $266 million of the originally authorized amount under the share repurchase program remained available for future repurchases. In January 2025, our board of directors authorized an additional $3.0 billion in repurchases under the share repurchase program. Refer to Note 13 “Stockholders’ Equity” to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.
We have also issued long-term debt to finance our business
.
In August 2020, we issued 1.40% fixed rate ten-year notes with an aggregate principal amount of $1.5 billion due on September 1, 2030 (the “2030 Notes”).
Our free cash flows, together with our other sources of liquidity, are available to service our liabilities as well as our cancellable and non-cancellable arrangements. We anticipate cash flows generated from operations, cash, cash equivalents and investments will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs for at least the next 12 months. As we look beyond the next 12 months, we seek to continue to grow free cash flows necessary to fund our operations and grow our business. If we require additional capital resources, we may seek to finance our operations from the current funds available or additional equity or debt financing.
