operating facilities jointly used by UPRR and other railroads; transportation and lodging for train crew employees; trucking and contracting costs for intermodal containers; leased automobile maintenance expenses; and tools and supplies. Purchased services and materials decreased 4% in 2024 compared to 2023 driven by declines in locomotive maintenance expense due to a smaller active fleet as productivity improved year-over-year, decreased volume-related drayage cost incurred at one of our subsidiaries, and a favorable contract settlement, partially offset by inflation and volume-related costs.
Fuel
– Fuel includes locomotive fuel and gasoline for highway and non-highway vehicles and heavy equipment. Fuel expense decreased compared to 2023 due to a decrease in locomotive diesel fuel prices, which averaged $2.64 per gallon (including taxes and transportation costs) in 2024 compared to $3.09 per gallon in 2023, resulting in a $0.4 billion decrease in expense (excluding any impact from decreased volumes year-over-year), and a 1% improvement to the fuel consumption rate in 2024 (computed as gallons of fuel consumed divided by gross ton-miles), partially offset by a 1% increase in gross ton-miles.
Depreciation
– The majority of depreciation relates to road property, including rail, ties, ballast, and other track material. Depreciation expense was up 3% in 2024 compared to 2023 due to a higher depreciable asset base.
Equipment and Other Rents
– Equipment and other rents expense primarily includes rental expense that the Railroad pays for freight cars owned by other railroads or private companies; freight car, intermodal, and locomotive leases; and office and other rent expenses, offset by equity income from certain equity method investments. Equipment and other rents expense decreased 3% compared to 2023 due to lower lease expense and improved cycle times, partially offset by increased demand in commodities utilizing freight cars owned by others and inflation.
Other
– Other expenses include state and local taxes; freight, equipment, and property damage; utilities; insurance; personal injury; environmental; employee travel; telephone and cellular; computer software; bad debt; and other general expenses. Other expenses decreased 8% in 2024 compared to 2023 driven by lower personal injury costs, a 2024 gain on the sale of intermodal equipment, and a 2023 write-off, partially offset by higher freight loss and damage and other casualty cost.
Non-Operating Items
Other Income, net
– Other income decreased in 2024 compared to 2023 driven by a $107 million real estate transaction in 2023 and lower income from other real estate transactions, partially offset by interest received in 2024 from the IRS on refund claims. See Note 6 to the Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Item 8, for additional detail.
