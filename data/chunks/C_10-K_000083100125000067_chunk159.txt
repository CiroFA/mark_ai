include potential impacts on vulnerable industries and regions due to emerging macroeconomic risks and uncertainty including those related to potential global recession, inflation, interest rates, commodity prices, and geopolitical tensions. The assessment also included an evaluation of the conceptual soundness and performance of the PD, LGD, and EAD models. In addition, auditor judgment was required to evaluate the sufficiency of audit evidence obtained.
The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the Company’s measurement of the collective ACLL estimate, including controls over the:
•
approval of the collective ACLL methodologies, including the PD, LGD, and EAD
•
determination of the significant assumptions used to estimate the quantitative and qualitative components of the collective ACLL
•
performance monitoring of the PD, LGD, and EAD models.
We evaluated the Company’s process to develop the collective ACLL estimate by testing certain sources of data and assumptions that the Company used and considered the relevance and reliability of such data and assumptions. In addition, we involved credit risk professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in:
•
evaluating the Company’s collective ACLL methodologies for compliance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles
•
continued assessment of the conceptual soundness and performance testing of the PD, LGD, and EAD models by inspecting the model documentation to determine whether the models are suitable for their intended use
•
evaluating judgments made by the Company relative to the performance monitoring testing of the PD, LGD, and EAD models by comparing them to relevant Company-specific metrics
•
assessing the macroeconomic forecast scenarios through comparison to publicly available forecasts
•
testing corporate loan risk ratings for a selection of borrowers by evaluating the financial performance of the borrower, sources of repayment, and any relevant guarantees or underlying collateral
•
evaluating the methodologies used to develop the qualitative component and their significant assumptions and the effect of that component on the collective ACLL compared with relevant credit risk factors and consistency with credit trends.
We also assessed the sufficiency of the audit evidence obtained related to the collective ACLL by evaluating the:
•
cumulative results of the audit procedures
•
qualitative aspects of the Company’s accounting practices
•
potential bias in the accounting estimates.
