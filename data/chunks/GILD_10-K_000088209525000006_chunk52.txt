Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities
In the first quarter of 2020, our Board of Directors authorized a $5.0 billion stock repurchase program (“2020 Program”), with no fixed expiration. Purchases under the 2020 Program may be made in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, but the program does not obligate us to repurchase any specific number of shares and may be amended, suspended or discontinued at any time.
