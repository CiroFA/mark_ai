and liabilities recorded at fair value on a recurring basis as a critical audit matter. A high degree of effort, including specialized skills and knowledge, and subjective and complex auditor judgment was involved in the assessment of the Level 3 fair values due to measurement uncertainty. Specifically, the assessment encompassed the evaluation of the fair value methodology, including methods, models and significant assumptions used to estimate fair value. Significant assumptions include the use of proxy information, the extrapolation and interpolation of proxy information, and the use of historic pricing information as well as certain model assumptions. The assessment also included an evaluation of the conceptual soundness and performance of the valuation models.
The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We involved valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge who assisted in evaluating the design and testing the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the Company’s Level 3 fair value measurements including controls over:
•
valuation methodologies, including significant assumptions
•
independent price verification
•
evaluating that significant model assumptions reflected those which a market participant would use to determine an exit price in the current market environment
•
the valuation models used were mathematically accurate and appropriate to value the financial instruments and
•
relevant information used within the Company’s models that was reasonably available was considered in the fair value determination.
We evaluated the Company’s methodology for compliance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We involved valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge who assisted in developing an independent fair value estimate for a selection of certain Level 3 assets and liabilities recorded at fair value on a recurring basis based on independently developed valuation models and assumptions, as applicable, using market data sources we determined to be relevant and reliable and compared our independent expectation to the Company’s fair value measurements.
Assessment of the allowance for credit losses collectively evaluated for impairment
As described in Notes 1 and 16 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s total allowance for credit losses on loans, leases and unfunded lending commitments was $20,175 million as of December 31, 2024, which includes the allowance related to loans and unfunded lending commitments collectively evaluated for impairment (the collective ACLL). The expected credit losses for the quantitative component of the collective ACLL is the product of multiplying the probability of default (PD), loss given default (LGD), and exposure at default (EAD), which are determined utilizing models, for consumer and corporate loans. The PD, LGD, and EAD assumptions are determined based on three macroeconomic
