The Company files U.S. Federal, state and foreign tax returns.  The Company is currently under examination by the IRS for years 2016 through 2018 and is subject to examination for 2019 through 2023.  The Company is also generally subject to examination by various state and foreign jurisdictions for years 2017 through 2023.  While the Company is in various stages of inquiry and examination with certain taxing authorities and believes that its tax positions will more likely than not be sustained, it is nonetheless possible that future obligations related to these matters could arise.  The Company believes that adequate amounts have been reserved for any adjustments that may ultimately result from an examination.
Given the potential outcome of current examinations, it is reasonably possible that the balance of unrecognized tax benefits could significantly change within the next twelve months.  However, an estimate of the range of reasonably possible adjustments cannot be made at this time.
