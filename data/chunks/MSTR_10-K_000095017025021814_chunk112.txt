in arrears, such as certain time and materials contracts. As of December 31, 2024, we had an aggregate transaction price of $454.9 million allocated to the remaining performance obligation related to subscription services, product support, product licenses, and other services contracts. We expect to recognize approximately $278.4 million of the remaining performance obligation over the next 12 months and the remainder thereafter. However, the timing and ultimate recognition of our deferred revenue and advance payments and other remaining performance obligations depend on our satisfaction of various performance obligations, and the amount of deferred revenue and advance payments and remaining performance obligations at any date should not be considered indicative of revenues for any succeeding period.

Principal and Potential Sources of Liquidity
Our principal sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents and on-going collection of our accounts receivable. Cash and cash equivalents may include holdings in bank demand deposits, money market instruments, certificates of deposit, and U.S. Treasury securities.  As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we held cash and cash equivalents of (i) $8.8 million and $10.5 million, respectively, through our U.S. entities and (ii) $29.3 million and $36.3 million, respectively, through our non-U.S. entities. We earn a significant amount of our revenues outside the United States and we repatriated foreign earnings and profits of $6.5 million during 2024 and $20.3 million during 2023.
