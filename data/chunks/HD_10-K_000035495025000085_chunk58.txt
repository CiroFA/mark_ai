that highlights the performance of our existing locations and websites by measuring the change in net sales for a period over the comparable prior period of equivalent length. Comparable sales includes sales at all locations, physical and online, open greater than 52 weeks (including remodels and relocations) and excludes closed stores. Retail stores become comparable on the Monday following their 52
nd
week of operation. Acquisitions are typically included in comparable sales after they have been owned for more than 52 weeks. Our comparable sales results for fiscal 2024 exclude the 53rd week and compare weeks 1 through 52 in fiscal 2024 to the 52-week period reported for fiscal 2023. The method of calculating comparable sales varies across the retail industry. As a result, our method of calculating comparable sales may not be the same as similarly titled measures reported by other companies.
Total comparable sales decreased 1.8% in fiscal 2024, reflecting a 1.0% decrease in comparable customer transactions and a 0.9% decrease in comparable average ticket compared to fiscal 2023. The decrease in comparable customer transactions primarily reflects the impact of heightened macroeconomic uncertainties and other macroeconomic factors, including the impacts of a persisting high interest rate environment pressuring home improvement demand. The decrease in comparable average ticket primarily reflects price stabilization relative to last year, slightly offset by demand for new and innovative products.
For fiscal 2024
, our Power and Building Materials merchandising departments posted positive comparable sales compared to fiscal 2023. All of our other merchandising departments posted negative comparable sales during fiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023.
Gross Profit
Gross profit increased $2.3 billion, or 4.6%, to $53.3 billion in fiscal 2024. Gross profit as a percent of net sales, or gross profit margin, was 33.4% for both fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023, and primarily reflected lower transportation costs and lower shrink within our Primary segment, offset by the inclusion of SRS in our consolidated results.
Operating Expenses
Our operating expenses are composed of SG&A and depreciation and amortization.
Selling, General & Administrative.
SG&A increased $2.2 billion, or 8.1%, to $28.7 billion in fiscal 2024. As a percent of net sales, SG&A was 18.0% in fiscal 2024 compared to 17.4% in fiscal 2023, which primarily reflects higher payroll costs, deleverage from a negative comparable sales environment and lower legal-related benefits.
Depreciation and Amortization.
Depreciation and amortization increased $361 million, or 13.5%, to $3.0 billion in fiscal 2024. As a percent of net sales, depreciation and amortization was 1.9% in fiscal 2024 compared to 1.8% in fiscal 2023
,
primarily reflecting increased intangible asset amortization expense of $239 million, of which $218 million was related to SRS, as well as increased depreciation expense from ongoing
