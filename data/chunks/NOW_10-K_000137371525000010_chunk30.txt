experience, difficulties in new geographic markets, including hiring qualified sales management personnel, penetrating the target market, and managing local operations. Risks associated with making our products and services available in international markets include, for example:
•
compliance with multiple, conflicting and changing governmental laws and regulations;
•
requirements to have local partner(s), local entity ownership limitations or technology transfer or sharing requirements, or to comply with data residency and transfer laws and regulations, privacy and data protection laws and regulations, which may increase operational costs and restrictions;
•
the possibility that illegal or unethical activities of our local employees or business partners will be attributed to us or cause us harm;
•
longer and potentially more complex sales and payment receipt cycles and other collection difficulties;
•
different pricing and distribution environments;
•
potential changes in international trade policies, tariffs, agreements and practices, including the adoption and expansion of formal or informal trade restrictions or regulatory frameworks that may favor local competitors;

Incorporating AI technology into our offerings may result in operational, legal, regulatory, ethical and other challenges.
We are increasingly innovating and expanding offerings on our platform by integrating AI technology. We expect AI to be an increasingly important driver of future growth, although, like many innovations, it presents risks and uncertainties that may impact our ability to realize its desired or anticipated benefits for our business.
AI technology is rapidly evolving and to remain competitive, we will need to make significant investments to continue to successfully develop and incorporate the technology into our products. Our ability to incorporate AI technology into our products depends on the availability and pricing of third-party hardware and software equipment and technical infrastructure. Our competitors or other third parties may develop or incorporate AI into their products more quickly or successfully than us. Other companies may also have or in the future may obtain intellectual proprietary rights that would prevent, limit, or interfere with our ability to make, use, or sell our AI products. For these reasons, among others, we may not be able to compete effectively in the evolving AI market.
Our business model may be affected by global trends and laws that govern the use of AI and machine learning. For example, the EU AI Act places new requirements on providers of AI technologies
