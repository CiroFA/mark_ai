total amount of unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2024 could decrease by up to approximately $
22
million in the next 12 months as a result of various audit closures, settlements or the expiration of the statute of limitations. The ultimate finalization of the Company’s examinations with relevant taxing authorities can include formal administrative and legal proceedings, which could have a significant impact on the timing of the reversal of unrecognized tax benefits. The Company believes that its reserves for uncertain tax positions are adequate to cover existing risks or exposures.
Interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions amounted to an expense of $
51
million in 2024, $
131
million in 2023 and $
54
million in 2022. These amounts reflect the beneficial impacts of various tax settlements. Liabilities for accrued interest and penalties were $
437
million and $
388
million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
In 2024, the Company recorded a benefit of $
519
million due to a reduction in reserves for unrecognized income tax benefits resulting from the expiration in 2024 of the statute of limitations for assessments related to the 2019 and 2020 federal tax return years. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is currently conducting examinations of the Company’s tax returns for the years 2017 and 2018, including the one-time transition tax enacted under the TCJA. If the IRS disagrees with the Company’s transition tax position, it may result in a significant tax liability. The IRS is also currently conducting examinations of the Company’s tax returns for the years 2021 and 2022. In addition, various state and foreign tax examinations are in progress and for these jurisdictions, the Company’s income tax returns are open for examination for the period 2009 through 2024.
