company’s attainment of specified performance targets at the end of a
three-year
period. Compensation expense related to these awards is recognized over the
three-year
performance period based on the fair value of the closing market price of the company’s ordinary shares on the date of the grant and the estimated performance that will be achieved. Compensation expense for ROC awards will be adjusted during the
three-year
performance period based upon the estimated performance levels that will be achieved. TSR awards are measured at their grant date fair value and not subsequently re-measured. The number of performance-based stock unit awards granted in 2024 includes an increase of
177,383
stock units to the target number of performance-based awards originally granted in 2021, as these awards achieved a higher payout factor upon completion of the
three-year
performance period.
The weighted-average fair value of ROC awards granted in 2024 was $
450.53
($
340.80
in 2023 and $
257.63
in 2022). These fair values are based on the closing market price of Linde's ordinary shares on the grant date adjusted for dividends that will not be paid during the vesting period.
The weighted-average fair value of TSR awards granted in 2024 was $
664.77
($
489.33
in 2023 and $
301.42
in 2022) and was estimated using a Monte Carlo simulation performed as of the grant date.
There were
124,471
restricted stock units granted to employees by Linde during 2024. The weighted-average fair value of restricted stock units granted during 2024 was $
449.10
($
332.69
in 2023 and $
260.27
in 2022). These fair values are based on the closing market price of Linde's ordinary shares on the grant date adjusted for dividends that will not be paid during the vesting period. Compensation expense related to the restricted stock units is recognized over the vesting period.
