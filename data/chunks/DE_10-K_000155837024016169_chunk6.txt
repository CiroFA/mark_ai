expenses require the use of estimates. The main estimate is the present value of the projected future benefit payments. These future benefit payments extend several decades.
The estimates are based on existing retirement plan provisions. No assumption is made regarding any potential changes to benefit provisions beyond those to which we are presently committed (e.g., in existing labor contracts).
The key assumptions used by our actuaries to calculate the estimates include:
Assumptions are set each year-end. These assumptions are not changed during the year unless there is a significant plan event. Actual results that differ from the assumptions affect future expenses and obligations.

The increase in the 2024 pension and OPEB net benefit was due to an increase in the expected long-term rates of return on pension plan assets and the Canadian pension settlement charge recognized in 2023 (see Note 7).
The effect of hypothetical changes to selected assumptions on our major U.S. retirement benefit plans would be as follows:
​
*
Projected benefit obligation (PBO) for pension plans and accumulated postretirement benefit obligation (APBO) for OPEB plans.
**
Pretax impact on service cost, interest cost, and amortization of gains or losses.

Allowance for Credit Losses
The allowance for credit losses is an estimate of the credit losses expected over the life of the receivable portfolio. The allowance is measured on a collective basis for receivables with similar risk characteristics. Receivables that do not share risk characteristics are evaluated on an individual basis. Risk characteristics include:
We utilize the following loss forecast models to estimate expected credit losses:
Management reviews each model’s output quarterly, and qualitative adjustments are incorporated as necessary to arrive at management’s best estimate of expected credit losses.
Allowance for Credit Losses
During 2024, we determined that the financial services business in Brazil met the held for sale criteria. The receivables in Brazil were reclassified to “Assets held for sale.” The associated allowance for credit losses was reversed and a valuation allowance for the assets held for sale was recorded (see Note 4). Excluding the business in Brazil, the allowance for credit losses increased, primarily due to higher expected losses as a result of elevated delinquencies and a decline in market conditions. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in the allowance on revolving charge accounts, driven by write-offs of seasonal financing program accounts and recoveries expected on those accounts in the future.
While we believe our allowance is sufficient to provide for losses over the life of our existing receivable portfolio, different assumptions would result in changes to the allowance for credit losses. Within the retail customer receivable portfolio, credit loss estimates are dependent on a number of
