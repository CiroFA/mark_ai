JPMorganChase also experiences:
•
distributed denial-of-service attacks intended to disrupt JPMorganChase’s websites, including those that provide online banking and other services,
•
a higher volume and complexity of cyber attacks against the backdrop of heightened geopolitical tensions, and
•
a high volume of disruptions to internet-based services used by JPMorganChase that are provided by third parties.
JPMorganChase has experienced security breaches due to cyber attacks in the past, and it is inevitable that additional breaches will occur in the future. Any such breach could result in serious and harmful consequences for JPMorganChase or its clients and customers.
A principal reason that JPMorganChase cannot provide absolute security against cyber attacks is that it may not always be possible to anticipate, detect or recognize threats to JPMorganChase’s systems, or to
implement effective preventive measures against all breaches due to evolving risks, including:
•
the techniques used in cyber attacks evolve frequently and increase in sophistication, and therefore may not be recognized until launched or may go undetected for extended periods
•
cyber attacks can originate from a wide variety of sources, including JPMorganChase’s own employees, cyber-criminals, hacktivists, groups linked to terrorist organizations or hostile nation-states that can sustain malicious activities for extended periods, or third parties whose objective is to disrupt the operations of financial institutions more generally
•
JPMorganChase does not have control over the cybersecurity of the systems of the large number of clients, customers, counterparties and third-party service providers with which it does business, and
•
it is possible that a third party, after establishing a foothold on an internal network without being detected, may gain access to other networks and systems.
The risk of a security breach due to a cyber attack could increase in the future due to factors such as:
•
JPMorganChase’s ongoing expansion of its digital banking and other internet-based product offerings and its internal use of internet-based products and applications, including those that use cloud computing services
•
advances in artificial intelligence, such as the use of machine learning, generative artificial intelligence and quantum computing by malicious actors to develop more advanced social engineering attacks, including targeted phishing attacks
•
the inability to maintain the security of information transmitted by JPMorganChase due to advances in quantum computing that may counteract or nullify existing information protections, and
•
the acquisition and integration of new businesses.
In addition, a third party could misappropriate confidential information obtained by intercepting signals or communications from mobile devices used by JPMorganChase’s employees.
