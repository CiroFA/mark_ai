Our reputation and/or business could be negatively impacted by corporate responsibility matters and/or our reporting of such matters.
There is an increasing focus from regulators, certain investors, and other stakeholders concerning corporate responsibility matters, both in the United States and internationally. We communicate certain corporate responsibility-related initiatives, goals, and/or commitments regarding sustainability matters, inclusion, responsible sourcing and social investments, and other matters in our annual Corporate Responsibility Report, on our website, in our filings with the SEC, and elsewhere. These initiatives, goals, or commitments could be difficult to achieve and costly to implement. We could fail to achieve, or be perceived to fail to achieve, our corporate responsibility-related initiatives, goals, or commitments.

These laws and regulations may also impact our innovation and business drivers in developing new and
