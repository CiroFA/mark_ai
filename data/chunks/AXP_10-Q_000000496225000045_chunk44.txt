Card Member loans and receivables. In addition, we hold all of the variable interests in both Trusts, with the exception of the debt securities issued to third-party investors.
Our ownership of variable interests in the Lending Trust was $
12.8
billion and $
14.6
billion as of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively, and in the Charge Trust was $
4.2
billion and $
3.9
billion as of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively.
These variable interests held by us provide us with the right to receive benefits and the obligation to absorb losses, which could be significant to both the Lending Trust and the Charge Trust. Based on these considerations, we are the primary beneficiary of the Trusts and therefore consolidate the Trusts.
Restricted cash and cash equivalents held by the Lending Trust was $
102
million and $
88
million as of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively, and by the Charge Trust was
nil
as of both March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024. These amounts relate to collections of Card Member loans and receivables to be used by the Trusts to fund future expenses and obligations, including interest on debt securities, credit losses and upcoming debt maturities.
Under the respective terms of the Lending Trust and the Charge Trust agreements, the occurrence of certain triggering events associated with the performance of the assets of each Trust could result in payment of trust expenses, establishment of reserve funds, or, in a worst-case scenario, early amortization of debt securities. During the three months ended March 31, 2025 and the year ended December 31, 2024, no such triggering events occurred.
