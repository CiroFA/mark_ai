MK-1654, clesrovimab, is an investigational prophylactic long-acting monoclonal antibody designed to protect infants from respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) disease during their first RSV season under review by the FDA. Clesrovimab is also under review in the EU.
•
Additionally,
Keytruda
is under review in the EU and Japan for a supplemental indication for the treatment of certain patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma.
During 2024, the Company initiated more than 20 Phase 3 studies spanning cardiometabolic, immunology, infectious diseases, oncology, ophthalmology and vaccines.
The Company is diversifying its oncology portfolio and executing on its strategy which is broadly based on three strategic pillars: immuno-oncology, precision molecular targeting and tissue targeting. Merck’s Phase 3 oncology programs within these pillars are as follows:
Immuno-oncology
•
MK-1308A, the coformulation of quavonlimab, Merck’s novel investigational anti-CTLA-4 antibody, in combination with pembrolizumab for RCC;
•
MK-3475,
Keytruda
, in the therapeutic areas of hepatocellular, ovarian and small-cell lung cancers;
•
MK-3475A, the subcutaneous coformulation of pembrolizumab in combination with hyaluronidase, being evaluated for comparability with intravenous pembrolizumab in metastatic NSCLC; and
•
V940 (mRNA-4157), an investigational individualized neoantigen therapy, in combination with
Keytruda
, as an adjuvant treatment in patients with certain types of melanoma and NSCLC, being developed as part of a collaboration with Moderna, Inc.
Precision molecular targeting
•
MK-1026, nemtabrutinib, an oral, reversible, non-covalent Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor, for hematological malignancies, including chronic lymphocytic leukemia and small lymphocytic lymphoma;
•
MK-1084, an investigational oral selective
KRAS
G12C inhibitor, in combination with
Keytruda
, for metastatic NSCLC;
•
MK-3543, bomedemstat, an investigational orally available lysine-specific demethylase 1 inhibitor for myeloproliferative disorders;
•
MK-5684, opevesostat, an investigational cytochrome P450 11A1 (CYP11A1) inhibitor for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer;
•
MK-7339, Lynparza, in combination with
Keytruda
, for non-small-cell lung and small-cell lung cancers; and
•
MK-7902, Lenvima, being developed as part of a collaboration with Eisai Co., Ltd. (Eisai), in combination with
Keytruda
, for esophageal cancer.
Tissue targeting
•
MK-1022, patritumab deruxtecan, being developed in collaboration wtih Daiichi Sankyo, for NSCLC as noted above;
•
MK-2140, zilovertamab vedotin, an ADC targeting receptor tyrosine kinase-like orphan receptor 1 (ROR1) for hematological malignancies, including diffuse large B cell lymphoma;
•
MK-2400, ifinatamab deruxtecan, an ADC being evaluated in patients with relapsed SCLC versus chemotherapy, being developed as part of a collaboration with Daiichi Sankyo; and
