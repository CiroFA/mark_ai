During fiscal 2024, we saw customers scrutinizing spend and needing additional time to implement elevated levels of product shipments received in prior quarters. Revenue declined in both campus switching and data center switching, primarily driven by declines in our Catalyst 9000 series and Nexus 9000 series offerings. We experienced a revenue decline in enterprise routing, although we saw revenue growth in our SD-WAN offerings. The decrease in wireless was primarily driven by our WiFi-6 products and Meraki offerings. We also saw a revenue decline in routed optical networking.
