value of mortgage loans is determined using observable prices based on transactional data or third-party pricing for comparable instruments, when available.
•
Where position-specific external prices are not observable, fair value is estimated based on benchmarking to prices and rates observed in the primary market for similar loan
or borrower types or based on the present value of expected future cash flows using the Firm’s best available estimates of the key assumptions, including forecasted credit losses, prepayment rates, forward yield curves and discount rates commensurate with the risks involved or a methodology that utilizes the capital structure and credit spreads of recent comparable securitization transactions.
•
Fair value of equity margin loans is determined by discounting future interest cash flows, net of potential losses resulting from large downward price movements of the underlying margin loan collateral. The potential losses are modeled using the margin loan rate, which is calibrated from market observable CDS spreads, implied debt yields or volatility metrics of the loan collateral.
Valuation Hierarchy Classification:
•
Level 2—if value based on observable market data supported by market liquidity for comparable instruments
•
Level 3—in instances where prices or significant spread inputs are unobservable or not supported by market liquidity or if the comparability assessment involves significant subjectivity
Corporate and Other Debt
Corporate Bonds
Valuation Techniques:
•
Fair value is determined using recently executed transactions, market price quotations, bond spreads and CDS spreads obtained from independent external parties, such as vendors and brokers, adjusted for any basis difference between cash and derivative instruments.
•
The spread data used is for the same maturity as the bond. If the spread data does not reference the issuer, then data that references comparable issuers are used. When position-specific external price data is not observable, fair value is determined based on either benchmarking to comparable instruments or cash flow models with yield curves, bond or single-name CDS spreads and recovery rates or loss given default as significant inputs.
Valuation Hierarchy Classification:
•
Level 2—if value based on observable market data for comparable instruments
•
Level 3—in instances where prices or significant spread inputs are unobservable or if the comparability assessment involves significant subjectivity
CDOs
Valuation Techniques:
•
The Firm holds cash CDOs that typically reference a tranche of an underlying synthetic portfolio of single-name CDS spreads collateralized by corporate bonds (“CLN”) or cash portfolio of ABS/loans (“asset-backed CDOs”).
•
Credit correlation, a primary input used to determine the fair value of CLNs, is usually unobservable and derived using a benchmarking technique. Other model inputs, such as credit spreads, including collateral spreads and interest rates, are typically
