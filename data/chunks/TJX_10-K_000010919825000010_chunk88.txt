Credit Facilities
The Company has
two
TJX revolving credit facilities, a $
1
billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility maturing in June 2026 (the “2026 Revolving Credit Facility”) and a $
500
million revolving credit facility that was set to mature in May 2024 (the “2024 Revolving Credit Facility”). On May 8, 2023, the Company amended the 2024 Revolving Credit Facility (as amended, the “2028 Revolving Credit Facility”) to (i) extend the maturity to May 8, 2028 and (ii) replace the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) with a term secured overnight financing rate plus a
0.10
% credit spread adjustment (“Adjusted Term SOFR”). Term SOFR borrowings under the 2028 Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at the Adjusted Term SOFR plus a margin of
45.0
-
87.5
basis points and a quarterly facility fee payment of
5.0
-
12.5
basis points on the total commitments under the 2028 Revolving Credit Facility, in each case, based on the Company’s long-term debt ratings. All other material terms and conditions of the 2028 Revolving Credit Facility were unchanged from the 2024 Revolving Credit Facility.
Additionally, on May 8, 2023, the Company amended its 2026 Revolving Credit Facility to replace the LIBOR with Adjusted Term SOFR. Term SOFR borrowings under the 2026 Revolving Credit Facility, as amended, bear interest at the Adjusted Term SOFR plus a variable margin based on the Company’s long-term debt ratings. All other material terms and conditions of the 2026 Revolving Credit Facility were unchanged.
Under these credit facilities, the Company has maintained a borrowing capacity of $
1.5
billion. As of February 1, 2025 and February 3, 2024, there were
no
amounts outstanding under these facilities. Each of these facilities require TJX to maintain a ratio of funded debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and rentals (EBITDAR) of not more than
3.50
to 1.00 on a rolling four-quarter basis. TJX was in compliance with all covenants related to its credit facilities at the end of all periods presented.
In addition, as of February 1, 2025 and February 3, 2024, TJX Canada had a credit line of C$
10
million and the Company’s European business at TJX International had a credit line of £
5
million. As of February 1, 2025 and February 3, 2024, and during the years then ended, there were
no
