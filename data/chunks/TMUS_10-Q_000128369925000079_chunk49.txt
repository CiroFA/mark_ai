Churn
Churn represents the number of customers whose service was deactivated as a percentage of the average number of customers during the specified period further divided by the number of months in the period. The number of customers whose service was deactivated is presented net of customers that subsequently had their service restored within a certain period of time and excludes customers who received service for less than a certain minimum period of time. We believe that churn provides management, investors and analysts with useful information to evaluate customer retention and loyalty.
The following table sets forth the churn:
Postpaid phone churn increased 5 basis points, primarily from the temporary impact of current year rate plan optimizations.
Prepaid churn decreased 7 basis points, primarily driven by the inclusion of prepaid customers associated with the Ka’ena Acquisition with lower churn.
