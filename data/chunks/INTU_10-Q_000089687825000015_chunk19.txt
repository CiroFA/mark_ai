For the three and six months ended January 31, 2025, we recognized excess tax benefits on share-based compensation of $
29
million and $
57
million, respectively, in our provision for income taxes. For the three and six months ended January 31, 2024, we recognized excess tax benefits on share-based compensation of $
56
million and $
83
million, respectively, in our provision for income taxes.
Our effective tax rates for the three and six months ended January 31, 2025 were approximately
17
