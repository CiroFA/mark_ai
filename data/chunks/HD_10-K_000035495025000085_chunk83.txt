DEBT AND DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS
Short-Term Debt
At the beginning of fiscal 2024, we had a commercial paper program that allowed for an aggregate of $
5.0
billion in borrowings. In connection with this program, we had back-up credit facilities with a consortium of banks for an aggregate of $
5.0
billion in borrowings, which consisted of a
five-year
$
3.5
billion credit facility scheduled to expire in July 2027 and a
364
-day $
1.5
billion credit facility scheduled to expire in July 2024. At January 28, 2024, there were
no
outstanding borrowings under our commercial paper program or back-up credit facilities.
In May 2024, we increased our commercial paper program from $
5.0
billion to $
19.5
billion in connection with the anticipated financing of the acquisition of SRS (see
Note 13
for details regarding the SRS acquisition). In May 2024, in connection with the increase in the commercial paper program, we entered into
three
additional back-up credit facilities that consisted of a
364
-day $
3.5
billion credit facility scheduled to expire in May 2025, a
three-year
$
1.0
billion credit facility scheduled to expire in May 2027, and a
364
-day $
10.0
billion credit facility scheduled to expire in May 2025. The $
10.0
billion credit facility also provided that the commitments and any borrowings under that facility would be reduced by the amount of net cash proceeds we received from any future debt issuance.
In June 2024, leading up to the acquisition of SRS on June 18, 2024, we raised commercial paper borrowings of over $
15.0
billion to fund the transaction. On June 25, 2024, we received the proceeds from the issuance of $
10.0
billion of long-term debt, as further discussed below, and immediately used the proceeds to repay approximately $
10.0
billion of these commercial paper borrowings. On June 27, 2024, we terminated the $
10.0
billion back-up credit facility, and subsequently reduced our commercial paper program from $
19.5
billion to $
9.5
billion.
In July 2024, we completed the renewal of our
364
-day $
1.5
billion credit facility, extending the maturity from July 2024 to July 2025.
In December 2024, we reduced our total credit facilities and concurrently reduced our commercial paper program, each by $
2.5
billion. This reduction included terminating the
three-year
$
1.0
billion back-up credit facility that was scheduled to expire in May 2027 and reducing the aggregate commitments under
