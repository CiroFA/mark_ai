Services.
On an average basis, deposits were relatively flat year-over-year and increased 1% sequentially, primarily driven by
Services
. In the fourth quarter of 2024, average deposits for:
•
Services
increased 4% year-over-year, as TTS increased 3% due to deepened client relationships and growth in operational deposits, and Securities Services increased 11% driven by AUC growth.
•
USPB
decreased 18% year-over-year, as the transfer of certain relationships and the associated deposits to
Wealth
more than offset underlying deposit growth.
•
Wealth
increased 3% year-over-year, largely reflecting the transfer of certain relationships and the associated deposits from
USPB
, partially offset by the shift in deposits to higher-yielding investments on Citi’s platform.
•
All Other
decreased 21% year-over-year, primarily reflecting the continued wind-downs, the impact of FX translation of deposits in Legacy Franchises and reductions of corporate certificates of deposit in Corporate/Other.

In addition, nearly 80% of TTS deposits are from clients that have a longer than 15-year relationship with Citi.
