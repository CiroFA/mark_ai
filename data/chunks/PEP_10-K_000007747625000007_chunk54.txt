decrease in the underlying commodity price, would have increased our net unrealized losses in 2024 by $140 million, which would generally be offset by a reduction in the cost of the underlying commodity purchases.
Foreign Exchange
Our operations outside of the United States generated 44% of our consolidated net revenue in 2024, with Mexico, Russia, Canada, China, the United Kingdom, South Africa and Brazil, collectively, comprising approximately 25% of our consolidated net revenue in 2024. As a result, we are exposed to foreign exchange risks in the international markets in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold. Additionally, we are exposed to foreign exchange risk from net investments in foreign subsidiaries, foreign currency purchases, foreign currency assets and liabilities created in the normal course of business. During 2024, unfavorable foreign exchange reduced net revenue performance by 1.5 percentage points,

primarily due to declines in the Egyptian pound, Russian ruble, Mexican peso and Brazilian real. Currency declines against the U.S. dollar which are not offset could adversely impact our future financial results.
Our foreign exchange derivative contracts had a total notional value of $3.1 billion as of December 28, 2024 and $3.8 billion as of December 30, 2023. At the end of 2024, we estimate that an unfavorable 10% change in the underlying exchange rates would have decreased our net unrealized gains in 2024 by $319 million, which would be significantly offset by an inverse change in the fair value of the underlying exposure.
Our cross-currency swap contracts had a total notional value of $1.2 billion as of December 28, 2024 and $1.3 billion as of December 30, 2023. At the end of 2024, we estimate that an unfavorable 10% change in the underlying exchange rates would have increased our net unrealized losses in 2024 by $107 million, which would be significantly offset by an inverse change in the fair value of the underlying exposure.
The total notional amount of our debt instruments designated as net investment hedges was $2.9 billion as of December 28, 2024 and $3.0 billion as of December 30, 2023.
Interest Rates
Our interest rate swap contracts had a total notional value of $2.0 billion as of December 28, 2024. Assuming year-end 2024 investment levels and variable rate debt, a 1-percentage-point increase in interest rates would have decreased our net interest expense in 2024 by $32 million due to higher cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments levels, as compared with our variable rate debt.

We believe volume provides additional information to facilitate the comparison of our historical
