2024 FORM 10-K
78
We use foreign currency contracts to reduce the volatility of cash flows related to forecasted revenues, expenses, assets, and liabilities.
These contracts are generally
one
to
11
months
in duration but with maximum remaining maturities of up to
15
years
as of
December 31,
2024
. The objective of the foreign currency contracts is to ultimately reduce the extent to which functional currency or U.S. dollar-equivalent
cash flows are affected by changes in the applicable foreign currency exchange rates. We evaluate the effectiveness of our foreign
currency contracts designated as cash flow hedges on a quarterly basis.
The embedded derivatives the Company recognizes primarily consist of foreign currency related features in our purchase or sales contracts
where the currency is not the functional currency of either party to the contract.
Cash Flow Hedges.
For derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, changes in the fair value of designated hedging
instruments are initially recorded as a component of AOCI and subsequently reclassified to earnings in the period in which the hedged
transaction occurs and to the same financial statement line item impacted by the hedged forecasted transaction.
The total amount in AOCI related to cash flow hedges was a net
$
33
million
gain and a net
$
26
million
gain as of
December 31, 2024
and
2023
, respectively, of which a net
$
22
million
gain and a net
$
12
million
gain, respectively, related to our share of AOCI recognized at our
non-consolidated joint ventures. We expect to reclassify
$
45
million
of pre-tax net losses associated with designated cash flow hedges to
earnings in the next 12 months, contemporaneously with the earnings effects of the related forecasted transactions. The Company
reclassified net gains (losses) from AOCI into earnings of
$(
21
) million
,
$(
24
) million
and
$(
24
) million
for the
years ended
December 31,
2024
,
2023
, and
2022
,
respectively. As of
December 31, 2024
, the maximum length of time over which we are hedging forecasted
transactions was approximately
10
years
. The cash flows associated with cash flow hedges are recorded through the operating activities
section of the Consolidated and Combined Statement of Cash Flows. The Company assesses effectiveness for foreign currency cash flow
hedges related to long-term projects based on spot-to-spot foreign currency movements and excludes forward points from the assessment
of effectiveness.
Net Investment Hedges.
We enter into foreign exchange forwards designated as the hedging instruments in net investment hedging
relationships in order to mitigate the foreign currency risk attributable to the translation of the Company’s net investment in certain non
USD-functional subsidiaries and equity method investees. The total amount
