net sales were primarily due to increases in comparable sales, including fuel, of 4.7% and 2.3% for fiscal 2025 and 2024, respectively. Comparable sales in fiscal 2025 were driven by growth in transactions and unit volumes, with strong sales in grocery and health and wellness. Comparable sales in fiscal 2024 were driven by growth in transactions and average ticket, including strong sales in grocery and health and wellness. Additionally, fiscal 2025 and 2024 growth was partially offset by lower fuel sales primarily due to lower market prices. Sam's Club U.S. eCommerce sales positively contributed approximately
2.3%
and
1.7% to comparable sales for fiscal 2025 and 2024, respectively, which was primarily driven by club-fulfilled curbside pickup and delivery.
Membership and other income increased 13.3% and 7.5% for fiscal 2025 and 2024, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. For fiscal 2025 and 2024, the increases were primarily due to growth in membership base and Plus penetration. Fiscal 2025 and 2024 were also positively impacted by the expiration of a promotional offering offsetting membership fee increases during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024.
Gross profit rate increased 37 and 55 basis points for fiscal 2025 and 2024, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. For fiscal 2025, the increase in gross profit rate was primarily due to improved operational efficiencies related to merchandise flow and increased margins in fuel, partially offset by higher eCommerce fulfillment costs. For fiscal
2024
, the increase in gross profit rate was primarily due to the lapping of elevated markdowns in the prior year. Additionally, fiscal 2025 and 2024 gross profit rates were partially offset by product mix shifts into lower margin categories.
Operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales increased 44 and 46 basis points for fiscal 2025 and 2024, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. Fiscal 2025 operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased primarily due to increased compensation related expenses, including associate wage investments and higher variable pay as a result of exceeding our planned performance, as well as elevated technology spend. Fiscal 2024 operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased primarily due to lower fuel sales and elevated technology spend.
As a result of the factors discussed above, segment operating income increased $0.2 billion for both fiscal
2025 and
2024, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year.
