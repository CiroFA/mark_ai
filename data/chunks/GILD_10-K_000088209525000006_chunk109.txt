credits, and unrealized losses on our equity investments, partially offset by utilization of foreign net operating losses.
The valuation allowance increased $
64
million for the year ended December 31, 2023, primarily due to unrealized losses on our equity investments.
As of December 31, 2024, we had U.S. federal net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards of approximately $
602
million and $
45
million, respectively, which will start to expire in 2025 if not utilized. In addition, we had state net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards of approximately $
3.0
billion and $
1.1
billion, respectively, which will start to expire in 2025 and 2027, respectively, if not utilized. Utilization of net operating losses and tax credits may be subject to an annual limitation due to ownership change limitations provided in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and similar state provisions. This annual limitation may result in the expiration of the net operating losses and credits before utilization.
We file federal, state and foreign income tax returns in the U.S. and in many foreign jurisdictions. For federal income tax purposes, the statute of limitations is open for 2019 and onwards and 2016 and onwards for California income tax purposes. For certain acquired entities, the statute of limitations is open for all years from inception due to our utilization of their net operating losses and credits carried over from prior years.
Our income tax returns are subject to audit by federal, state and foreign tax authorities. We are currently under examination by the Internal Revenue Service for our 2019 to 2021 tax years. There are differing interpretations of tax laws and regulations, and as a result, significant disputes may arise with these tax authorities involving issues of the timing and amount of deductions and allocations of income among various tax jurisdictions. We periodically evaluate our exposures associated with our tax filing positions.
Of the total unrecognized tax benefits, $

46
million, $
35
million and $
3
million on our Consolidated Statements of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits were $
133
million and $
180
million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. As of December 31, 2024, we do not believe that it is reasonably possible that our unrecognized tax benefits will significantly change in the next 12 months.
