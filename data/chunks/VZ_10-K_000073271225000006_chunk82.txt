Cash Flows Provided By Operating Activities
Our primary source of funds continues to be cash generated from operations. Net cash provided by operating activities decreased $563 million during 2024 compared to 2023 primarily due to changes in working capital, partially offset by an increase in earnings and an increase in Other, net cash flow from operating activities.
Changes in current assets and liabilities, net of effects from acquisition/disposition of businesses
The change in working capital was primarily driven by higher cash income taxes paid in the current period as well as higher interest expense and severance payments primarily related to separations under our voluntary separation program.
Other, Net
Other, net cash flow from operating activities during 2024 includes $2.0 billion of proceeds related to the transaction with Vertical Bridge REIT, LLC (Vertical Bridge).

We expect that there will be no required pension funding through the end of 2025, subject to changes in market conditions.
