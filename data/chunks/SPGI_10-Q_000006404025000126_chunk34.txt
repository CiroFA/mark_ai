Two in the future, and it is in the process of evaluating the potential impact of the enactment of Pillar Two by such jurisdictions on its consolidated financial statements.
Investing activities
Our cash outflows from investing activities are primarily for acquisitions and capital expenditures, while cash inflows are primarily proceeds from dispositions.
Cash used for investing activities increased to $79 million for the first three months of 2025 compared to $20 million in the first three months of 2024, primarily due to higher cash paid for short-term investments and capital expenditures in 2025.
Financing activities
Our cash outflows from financing activities consist primarily of share repurchases, dividends to shareholders and repayments of short-term and long-term debt, while cash inflows are primarily attributable to the borrowing of short-term and long-term debt.
Cash used for financing activities increased $446 million to $1,103 million for the first three months of 2025. The increase is primarily attributable to proceeds received from commercial paper borrowings in 2024 and an increase in cash used for share repurchases in 2025.
During the three months ended March 31, 2025, we purchased a total of 1.0 million shares for $650 million of cash. During the three months ended March 31, 2024, we purchased a total of 1.0 million shares for $500 million of cash. See Note 8

Additional Financing
We have the ability to borrow a total of $2.0 billion through our commercial paper program, which is supported by our $2.0 billion five-year credit agreement (our “credit facility”) that will terminate on December 17, 2029. As of March 31, 2025, and December 31, 2024, we had no outstanding commercial paper.
Commitment fees for the unutilized commitments under the credit facility and applicable margins for borrowings thereunder are linked to the Company achieving three environmental sustainability performance indicators related to emissions, tested annually. For the three months ended March 31, 2025, we paid a commitment fee of 7 basis points. There will be no sustainability pricing adjustment to our commitment fees or our margins under the credit facility for the approximately year-long period beginning April 7, 2025 as a result of our emissions performance for the year ended December 31, 2024. The credit facility contains customary affirmative and negative covenants and customary events of default. The occurrence of an event of default could result in an acceleration of the obligations under the credit facility.
T
he only financial covenant required is that our indebtedness to cash flow ratio, as defined in our credit facility, was not greater than 4 to 1, and this covenant level
has never been exceeded.
Dividends
On January 28, 2025, the Board of Directors approved a quarterly common stock dividend of $0.96 per share.
