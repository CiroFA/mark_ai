Credit Quality
In addition to monitoring delinquency, Schwab monitors the credit quality of First Mortgages and HELOCs by stratifying the portfolios by the following:
•
Year of origination;
•
Borrower Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) scores at origination (Origination FICO);
•
Updated borrower FICO scores (Updated FICO);
•
Loan-to-value (LTV) ratios at origination (Origination LTV); and
•
Estimated Current LTV ratios (Estimated Current LTV).
Borrowers’ FICO scores are provided by an independent third-party credit reporting service and are generally updated quarterly. The Origination LTV and Estimated Current LTV for a HELOC include any first lien mortgage outstanding on the same property at the time of the HELOC’s origination. The Estimated Current LTV for each loan is updated on a monthly basis by reference to a home price appreciation index.
