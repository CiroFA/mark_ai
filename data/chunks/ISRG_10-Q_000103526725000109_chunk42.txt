addition, system demand in China has been adversely impacted by increasing robotic-assisted surgical system competition from domestic companies and, to a lesser extent, a broader central government focus on systematic governance. Currently, the extent and impact of the competitive dynamics and this campaign in China on our business remains uncertain.
We expect that future placements of da Vinci surgical systems will be impacted by a number of factors: supply chain risks; economic and geopolitical factors; inflationary pressures; high interest rates; hospital staffing shortages; procedure growth rates; evolving system utilization and point-of-care dynamics; capital replacement trends, including a declining number of older generation systems available for trade-in transactions; additional reimbursements in various global markets, such as in Japan; the timing around governmental tenders and authorizations, as well as governmental actions impacting the tender process, such as the governance campaign in China; hospitals’ response to the evolving healthcare environment; the timing of when we receive regulatory clearance in our other OUS markets for our da Vinci 5, da Vinci X, da Vinci Xi, and da Vinci SP surgical systems and related instruments; and the market response.
Demand may also be impacted by the competition we currently face, or expect to face, from companies offering products for open or MIS surgeries, companies providing other therapeutic approaches for target clinical conditions, and companies

developing diagnostic solutions that could serve as alternatives to current or planned Intuitive offerings. Companies that have introduced products in the field of robotic-assisted medical procedures, or have made explicit statements about their efforts to enter the field, include, but are not limited to, the following: Beijing Surgerii Robotics Company Limited; CMR Surgical Ltd.; Distalmotion SA; Harbin Sizhe Rui Intelligent Medical Equipment Co., Ltd.; Johnson & Johnson; Karl Storz SE & Co. KG; Medicaroid Corporation; Medtronic plc; meerecompany Inc.; Noah Medical; Shandong Weigao Group Medical Polymer Company Ltd.; Shanghai Microport Medbot (Group) Co., Ltd.; Shenzhen Edge Medical Co., Ltd.; and SS Innovations International, Inc.
Many of the above factors will also impact future demand for our Ion endoluminal system, as we extend our commercial offering into diagnostics, along with additional factors associated with a new product introduction, including, but not limited to, our ability to optimize manufacturing and our supply chain, competition, clinical data to demonstrate value, and market acceptance.
