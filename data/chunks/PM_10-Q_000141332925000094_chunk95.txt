At March 31, 2025, there were no borrowings under the committed revolving credit facilities, and the entire committed amounts were available for borrowing.
All banks participating in our committed revolving credit facilities have an investment-grade long-term credit rating from the credit rating agencies.  We continuously monitor the credit quality of our banking group, and at this time we are not aware of any potential non-performing credit provider.
These committed revolving credit facilities do not include any credit rating triggers, material adverse change clauses or any provisions that could require us to post collateral.  We expect to continue to meet our covenants.
In addition to the committed revolving credit facilities discussed above, PMI maintains certain short-term credit arrangements, including uncommitted credit lines, to primarily meet working capital needs. These credit arrangements amounted to approximately $3.4 billion at March 31, 2025, and approximately $2.1 billion at December 31, 2024.  Borrowings under these arrangements and other bank loans amounted to $269 million at March 31, 2025, and $137 million at December 31, 2024.
