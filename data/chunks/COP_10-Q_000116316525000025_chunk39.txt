Certain of our project-related contracts, commercial contracts and derivative instruments contain provisions requiring us to post collateral. Many of these contracts and instruments permit us to post either cash or letters of credit as collateral. At March 31, 2025, and December 31, 2024, we had direct bank letters of credit of $284 million and $278 million, respectively, which secured performance obligations related to various purchase commitments incident to the ordinary conduct of business. In the event of a credit rating downgrade, we may be required to post additional letters of credit.
Shelf Registration
We have a universal shelf registration statement on file with the SEC under which we have the ability to issue and sell an indeterminate number of various types of debt and equity securities.

We believe in delivering value to our shareholders through our return of capital framework. The framework is structured to deliver a compelling, growing ordinary dividend and through-cycle share repurchases. We anticipate returning greater than 30 percent of cash from operating activities through cycles.
In the first three months of 2025, we paid ordinary dividends of $0.78 per share and in the first three months of 2024, we paid ordinary dividends of $0.58 per share and VROC payments of $0.20 per share.
In May 2025, we declared an ordinary dividend of $0.78 per share, payable June 2, 2025, to shareholders of record at the close of business on May 19, 2025.
In late 2016, we initiated our current share repurchase program. In October 2024, our Board of Directors approved an increase from our prior authorization of $45 billion by a total of the lesser of $20 billion or the number of shares issued in our acquisition of Marathon Oil, such that the Company is not to exceed $65 billion in aggregate purchases. Share repurchases are made at management’s discretion, at prevailing prices, subject to market conditions and other factors. As of March 31, 2025, share repurchases since the inception of our current program totaled 447.7 million shares and $35.8 billion. In the three months ended March 31, 2025, we repurchased 15.1 million shares for a cost of $1.5 billion.
