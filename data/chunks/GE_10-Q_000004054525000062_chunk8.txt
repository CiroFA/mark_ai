(loss). We believe that adjusting Corporate & Other costs to exclude the effects of items that are not closely associated with ongoing operations provides management and investors with a meaningful measure that increases the period-to-period comparability of our ongoing corporate costs.
For the three months ended March 31, 2025
, revenue increased by $0.1 billion compared to the three months ended March 31, 2024, due to higher run-off insurance operations revenue and lower intercompany eliminations. Corporate & Other operating profit decreased by $0.3 billion due to $0.6 billion of lower gains on retained and sold ownership interests and other equity securities, primarily related to our GE HealthCare investment, partially offset by $0.2 billion of lower separation costs and $0.1 billion of lower restructuring and other charges.
Adjusted Corporate & Other operating costs* decreased primarily due to a reduction in our functional costs and lower EHS costs, partially offset by lower bank interest.
OTHER CONSOLIDATED INFORMATION
RESTRUCTURING AND SEPARATION COSTS.
Significant, higher-cost restructuring programs, primarily related to the separations, are excluded from measurement of segment operating performance for internal and external purposes; those excluded amounts are reported in Restructuring and other charges for Corporate. In addition, we incur costs associated with separation activities, which are also excluded from measurement of segment operating performance for internal and external purposes. See Note 19 for further information on restructuring and separation costs.
INTEREST AND OTHER FINANCIAL CHARGES
were $0.2 billion and $0.3 billion for both the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively. The primary components of interest and other financial charges are interest on short- and long-term borrowings.
POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS

INCOME TAXES. For the three months ended March 31, 2025
, the effective income tax rate was 12.6% compared to 12.3% for the three months ended March 31, 2024. The provision for income taxes was $0.3 billion and $0.2 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively. The increase in the tax provision was primarily due to higher pre-tax income, lower non-taxable gains on our retained and sold ownership interests, and an increase in global minimum tax (Pillar 2), partially offset by tax benefits associated with realized foreign tax credits on the reinsurance transaction (see Note 12), and favorable audit resolutions for the three months ended March 31, 2025 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2024.
