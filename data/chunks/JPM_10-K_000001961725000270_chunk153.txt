reflecting timing and the classification of the prior-year expense, which was recognized in other expense in Corporate in the second quarter of 2023 as the individuals associated with First Republic were not employees of the Firm until July 2023.
Noncompensation expense
decreased as a result of:
•
lower FDIC-related expense recognized in Corporate, which included the impact of a $2.9 billion special assessment recognized in the fourth quarter of 2023, compared with a $725 million increase to the FDIC special assessment recognized in the first quarter of 2024, and
•
lower legal expense, reflecting the net impact of declines in CCB, CIB and Corporate, and an increase in AWM,
predominantly offset by
•
a $1.0 billion contribution of Visa shares to the JPMorgan Chase Foundation recorded in the second quarter of 2024 in Corporate,
•
higher investments in technology in the businesses, as well as marketing, predominantly in CCB,
•
higher occupancy expense, which included the impact of net additions to the Firm's properties,
•
higher distribution fees in AWM and brokerage expense in CIB, and
•
the timing impact associated with First Republic, offset by the alignment of expense to compensation expense, as noted above.

(a)
Effective January 1, 2024, as a result of adopting updates to the Accounting for Investments in Tax Credit Structures guidance, the amortization of certain of the Firm’s alternative energy tax-oriented investments is now recognized in income tax expense. Refer to Notes 1, 6, 14 and 25 for additional information.
2024 compared with 2023
The
effective tax rate
increased predominantly driven by:
•
the adoption of updates to the Accounting for Investments in Tax Credit Structures guidance on January 1, 2024, and
•
a higher level of pretax income and changes in the mix of income and expenses subject to U.S. federal, state and local taxes, including the impact of the net gain on Visa shares and the contribution of Visa shares to the JPMorgan Chase Foundation recorded in the second quarter of 2024.
The prior year included the impact to income tax expense associated with the First Republic acquisition that was reflected in the estimated bargain purchase gain, and an income tax benefit related to the finalization of certain income tax regulations, both of which resulted in a reduction in the Firm's effective tax rate.
Refer to Note 25 for additional information.
