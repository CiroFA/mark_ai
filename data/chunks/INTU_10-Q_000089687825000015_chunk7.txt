- In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09,
"Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures."
This standard requires additional disclosures related to the income tax rate reconciliation, income taxes paid by jurisdiction, and other income tax-related disclosures. The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, which means that it will be effective for us for the fiscal year ending July 31, 2026. Early adoption is permitted on either a prospective or retrospective basis. We are currently evaluating the impact of our pending adoption of ASU 2023-09 on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.

and in January 2025, the FASB issued ASU 2025-01,
"Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income - Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Clarifying the Effective Date,"
which clarified the effective date of ASU 2024-03.

Early adoption is permitted on either a prospective or retrospective basis. We are currently evaluating the impact of our pending adoption of ASU 2024-03 on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
