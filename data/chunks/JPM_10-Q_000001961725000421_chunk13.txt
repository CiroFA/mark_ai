As a result of lower average interest rates in the current period, the cost of funding for assets and the funding benefit earned for liabilities generally decreased compared with the prior year.
Foreign exchange risk
Foreign exchange risk is transferred from the LOBs and Other Corporate to Treasury and CIO for certain revenues and expenses. Treasury and CIO manages these risks centrally and reports the impact of foreign exchange rate movements related to the transferred risk in its results. Refer to Market Risk Management on pages 65-70 for additional information.
Capital allocation
The amount of capital assigned to each LOB and Corporate is referred to as equity. At least annually, the assumptions, judgments and methodologies used to allocate capital are reassessed and, as a result, the capital allocated to the LOBs and Corporate may change. Refer to Line of business and Corporate equity on page 36, and page 104 of JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K for additional information on capital allocation.
