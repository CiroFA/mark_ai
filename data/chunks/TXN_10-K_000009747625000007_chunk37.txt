Liquidity and capital resources
Our primary source of liquidity is cash flow from operations. Additional sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and access to debt markets. We also have a variable-rate, revolving credit facility. As of December 31, 2024, our credit facility was undrawn, and we had no commercial paper outstanding. Cash flows from operating activities for 2024 were $6.32 billion, a decrease of $102 million due to lower net income, partially offset by lower cash used for working capital. Cash flows from operating activities for 2024 include a cash benefit of $588 million from the U.S. CHIPS and Science Act (CHIPS Act) investment tax credit (ITC) used to reduce income taxes payable.
Investing activities for 2024 used $3.20 billion compared with $4.36 billion in 2023. Capital expenditures were $4.82 billion compared with $5.07 billion in 2023 and were primarily for semiconductor manufacturing equipment and facilities in both periods. Short-term investments provided cash proceeds of $1.47 billion in 2024 compared with $682 million in 2023.

As we continue to invest to strengthen our competitive advantages in manufacturing and technology, as part of our long-term capacity planning, our capital expenditures are expected to remain at elevated levels. We expect to receive between $7.5 billion to $9.5 billion through 2034 from the CHIPS Act. This includes the ITC for qualified U.S. manufacturing investments and direct funding of up to $1.6 billion for our three large-scale 300mm wafer fabs currently under construction in Sherman, Texas, and Lehi, Utah. We received $588 million
in associated cash benefit from qualifying capital expenditures in 2024.
Financing activities for 2024 used $2.88 billion compared with $2.14 billion in 2023. In 2024, we received net proceeds of $2.98 billion from the issuance of fixed-rate, long-term debt and retired maturing debt of $600 million. In 2023, we received net proceeds of $3.00 billion from the issuance of fixed-rate, long-term debt and retired maturing debt of $500 million. Dividends paid in 2024 were $4.80 billion compared with $4.56 billion in 2023, reflecting an increased dividend rate.
