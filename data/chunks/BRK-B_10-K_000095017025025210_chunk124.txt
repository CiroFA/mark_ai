revenues declined 5.2% in 2023 versus 2022. Customer orders slowed throughout 2023 in several regions, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region, attributable to elevated customer inventory levels and increasing price competition.
Pre-tax earnings of the service group decreased $52 million (1.7%) in 2023 to $3.0 billion. Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues declined 1.5 percentage points in 2023 compared to 2022. The earnings decline reflected lower earnings from TTI and certain of our other service businesses, partially offset by increased earnings from aviation services and the impact of the IPS acquisition. Earnings from TTI declined 17.3% in 2023, attributable to reduced sales and gross margin rates and higher operating expenses, partly offset by the impact of foreign currency exchange gains in 2023. The increase in earnings from aviation services was primarily attributable to a 14.4% increase in average aircraft within NetJets’ programs and higher rates.
Retailing
Our largest retailing business is Berkshire Hathaway Automotive, Inc. (“BHA”), which represented 69% of our retailing group revenue in 2024. BHA consists of over 80 auto dealerships that sell new and pre-owned automobiles and offer repair services and related products. BHA also offers and insures vehicle service contracts and related insurance products. Our retailing businesses also include four home furnishings businesses (Nebraska Furniture Mart, R.C. Willey, Star Furniture and Jordan’s), which sell furniture, appliances, flooring and electronics. The home furnishings group represented 17% of the retailing group revenues in 2024.
Other retailing businesses include three jewelry businesses (Borsheims, Helzberg and Ben Bridge), See’s Candies (confectionery products), Pampered Chef (high quality kitchen tools), Oriental Trading Company (party supplies, school supplies and toys and novelties) and Detlev Louis Motorrad (“Louis”), a retailer of motorcycle accessories based in Germany. Pilot, which is primarily a retail business, is addressed separately since it is deemed a segment for financial reporting purposes.
2024 versus 2023
Retailing group revenues declined 1.2% to $19.2 billion in 2024 compared to 2023. Except for BHA and Louis, each of our other retailing businesses experienced revenue declines in 2024 compared to 2023. BHA vehicle sales revenues increased 0.5% in 2024 versus 2023. New vehicle unit sales increased 7.9% and pre-owned unit sales declined 2.0% in 2024 versus 2023. Further, average vehicle selling prices were lower in 2024 versus 2023, attributable to increased inventory availability and product mix changes. Revenues of the home furnishings businesses declined 6.4% in 2024 versus 2023, primarily attributable to lower sales volumes and price competition. Also, combined revenues of our other retail businesses declined 5.8% in 2024 compared to 2023, attributable to increased competition and sluggish consumer demand.
