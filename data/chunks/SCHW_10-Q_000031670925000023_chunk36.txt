decrease in average BDA balances in the first quarter of 2025 compared to the same period in 2024 was primarily due to client cash allocation decisions in 2024 in response to elevated short-term market interest rates through most of 2024.
Average net yield increased in the first quarter of 2025 compared to the same period in 2024 due to an increase in the average amount of floating-rate BDA balances, which was partially offset by a decrease in the average net yields on fixed-rate and floating-rate BDA balances. The percentages of BDA balances designated as fixed-rate and floating-rate obligation amounts as of March 31, 2025 were 77% and 23%, respectively.
Other Revenue
Other revenue includes industry fees, certain service fees, other gains and losses from the sale of assets, and the provision for credit losses on bank loans.
Other revenue increased $51 million, or 32%, in the first quarter of 2025 compared to the same period in 2024, primarily due to higher industry fees. Industry fees increased primarily due to higher SEC fee rates in effect during the first quarter of 2025 compared to the same period in 2024 and an increase in trading volumes.
Subsequent to March 31, 2025, the SEC announced that effective May 14, 2025, it would decrease the fee rate applicable to most securities transactions to zero from the rate in effect since May 22, 2024. This change will result in lower industry fees in other revenue and a corresponding decrease in other expense after the effective date, resulting in no impact to net income.
