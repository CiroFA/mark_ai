This decrease was partially offset by (i) the impact of closing CLOs that were consolidated subsequent to March 31, 2024 and (ii) an increase in the amount of borrowings outstanding at certain consolidated funds and other investment vehicles.

Expenses - Asset Management
Compensation and Benefits Expense
The increase in compensation and benefits expense during the three months ended March 31, 2025, compared to the three months ended March 31, 2024, was primarily due to an increase in accrued discretionary cash compensation resulting from a higher level of asset management segment revenues in the current period.
Occupancy and Related Charges
The increase in occupancy and related charges during the three months ended March 31, 2025, compared to the three months ended March 31, 2024, was primarily due to the commencement of new office leases.
General, Administrative and Other
The increase in general, administrative and other expenses during the three months ended March 31, 2025, compared to the three months ended March 31, 2024, was primarily due to a higher level of expenses reimbursable by our investment funds and broken-deal expenses, partially offset by a prior year legal accrual that did not recur in the current period.
The level of broken-deal expenses can vary significantly period-to-period based upon a number of factors, the most significant of which are the number of potential investments being pursued for our investment funds, the size and complexity of investments being pursued, and the number of investment funds currently in their investment period.
In periods of increased fundraising and to the extent that we use third parties to assist in our capital raising efforts, our General, Administrative and Other expenses are expected to increase accordingly.

Net Premiums
Net premiums decreased for the three months ended March 31, 2025, as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2024, primarily due to a decrease in initial premiums assumed from fewer reinsurance transactions with life contingencies or morbidity risk during the three months ended March 31, 2025, as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2024. The initial premiums on assumed reinsurance were offset by a comparable decrease in policy reserves reported within net policy benefits and claims (as discussed below under “Expenses—Net policy benefits and claims”).
Net Investment Income
Net investment income increased for the three months ended March 31, 2025, as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2024, primarily due to (i) increased average assets under management due to growth in assets as a result of the cumulative impact of Global Atlantic's
