activities and working capital growth, after adjusting for an increase in Corporate & Other restructuring cash expenditures, which are excluded from FCF*.

CASH FLOWS FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
Cash used for operating activities of discontinued operations
was $1.1 billion in 2024, an increase of $1.7 billion compared to 2023, primarily driven by down payments received on equipment orders at our former GE Vernova business and disbursements for purchases of materials incurred by our former GE HealthCare business in 2023.
Cash from operating activities of discontinued operations
was $0.6 billion in 2023, a decrease of $1.3 billion compared to 2022, primarily driven by higher disbursements related to purchases of materials in prior periods and higher separation costs related to our former GE HealthCare business, partially offset by down payments received on equipment orders at our former GE Vernova business and tax receipts from our trailing operations.
Cash used for investing activities of discontinued operations
was $1.1 billion in 2024, a decrease of $2.6 billion compared to 2023, primarily driven by higher cash received of $4.6 billion from net settlements between our discontinued operations and businesses in continuing operations, due to cash received of $3.0 billion in 2024 related to the separation of our former GE Vernova business and cash paid of $1.1 billion in 2023 related to the separation of our former GE HealthCare business. In addition, there was a decrease in cash used due to the prior year separation of GE HealthCare cash and cash equivalents of $1.8 billion. These decreases in cash used were partially offset by a reduction of cash and cash equivalents of $4.2 billion due to the separation of GE Vernova in 2024.
Cash used for investing activities of discontinued operations
was $3.7 billion in 2023, a decrease of $4.4 billion compared to 2022, primarily driven by higher cash received of $6.3 billion from net settlements between our discontinued operations and businesses in continuing operations, due to cash received of $7.6 billion related to the separation of our former GE HealthCare business and cash paid of $0.8 billion related to the separation of our former GE Vernova business; partially offset by a reduction in cash due to the separation of GE HealthCare cash and cash equivalents of $1.8 billion in 2023.
Cash used for financing activities of discontinued operations
was $0.1 billion in 2024, a decrease of $2.0 billion compared to 2023, driven by GE HealthCare's long-term debt issuance of $2.0 billion in connection with the spin-off in 2023.
