Using these constant rates for full year 2024, our total revenue and advertising revenue would have been $165.37 billion and $161.51 billion, which were $874 million and $880 million higher than actual total revenue and advertising revenue, respectively.
Cost of revenue
Cost of revenue in 2024 increased $4.20 billion, or 16%, compared to 2023. The increase was primarily due to higher operational expenses related to our data centers and technical infrastructure, mostly from higher depreciation expense.
See Note 7 — Property and Equipment in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding depreciation expense.
Research and development
Research and development expenses in 2024 increased $5.39 billion, or 14%, compared to 2023. The increase was mostly due to higher employee compensation as well as infrastructure costs for research and development, partially offset by lower restructuring charges.
The higher employee compensation was mainly from a 13% growth in employee headcount from 2023 to 2024 in engineering and other technical functions supporting our continued investment in our family of products and Reality Labs.

Marketing and sales expenses in 2024 decreased $954 million, or 8%, compared to 2023. The decrease was primarily due to lower restructuring charges and, to a lesser extent, a decrease in employee compensation.
