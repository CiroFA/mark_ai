ACQUISITIONS, GOODWILL, AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS
Acquisitions
.
In the second quarter of 2023, our Gas Power business acquired Nexus Controls, a business specializing in aftermarket
control system upgrades and controls field services.
(a) Includes Gas Power's acquisition of Nexus Controls.
In the
fourth
quarter of 2024, we performed our annual impairment test. Based on the results of this test, the fair values of each of our
reporting units significantly exceeded their carrying values. Determining the fair values of reporting units requires the use of estimates and
significant judgments that are based on a number of factors including actual operating results. It is reasonably possible that estimates and
significant judgements could change in future periods.
All intangible assets are subject to amortization. Intangible assets decreased
$
230
million
in 2024,
primarily as a result of amortization.
Amortization expense was
$
277
million
,
$
240
million
,
and
$
1,018
million
for th
e years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022,
respectively.
In the first quarter of 2022, we signed a non-binding memorandum of understanding
to sell part of the nuclear activities in our Steam Power
business
to EDF, which resulted in a reclassification of that business to held for sale. As a result, we recognized a non-cash pre-tax
impairment charge of
$
765
million
related to intangible assets at our remaining Steam Powe
r business
, which is included in amortization.
We determined the fair value of these intangible assets using an income approach when testing for impairment. This charge was recorded
in
Selling, general, and administrative expenses
in our Consolidated and Combined Statement of Income (Loss). See Note
3
for further
information.
Estimated annual pre-tax amortization for intangible assets over the next five calendar years are as follows:
