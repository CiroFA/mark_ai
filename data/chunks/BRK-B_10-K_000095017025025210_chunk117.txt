PCC’s revenues were $10.4 billion in 2024, an increase of 12.0% compared to 2023. The revenue increase was primarily attributable to higher demand for aerospace products, and to a lesser degree, power generation products. Long-term industry forecasts continue to show growth and considerable demand for air travel and aerospace products. PCC’s pre-tax earnings increased 24.4% in 2024 compared to 2023, primarily attributable to sales increases and improved manufacturing and operating efficiencies. Continued growth in revenues and earnings will be predicated on PCC’s ability to successfully increase production levels to match the expected growth in aerospace products, as well as from improvements in industry supply chains and labor relations, which have been constraining commercial aircraft production at original equipment manufacturers.

Lubrizol’s pre-tax earnings increased 30.7% in 2024, primarily attributable to lower raw material costs, higher sales volumes and lower manufacturing costs, partially offset by the impact of lower selling prices and higher selling, general and administrative expenses.
