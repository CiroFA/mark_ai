financing receivable and equipment on operating lease portfolios.
Fair Value Measurement
– Quarterly, we use a combination of cash flow models to assess the sensitivity of our financial instruments with interest rate exposure to changes in market interest rates. The models calculate the effect of adjusting interest rates as follows:
The net impact in these financial instruments’ fair values which would be caused by decreasing or increasing the interest rates by 10 percent from the market rates at October 27, 2024, and October 29, 2023, would have been approximately $75 and $10, respectively.
Reference Rate Reform
– We transitioned our financing, funding, and hedging portfolios from the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) to alternative reference rates in 2023, and in 2024, we transitioned certain portfolios from the Canadian Dollar Offered Rate (CDOR) to an alternative reference rate. These transition activities did not have a material impact on our financial statements.
Foreign Currency Risk
We hedge significant currency exposures for our equipment operations. Worldwide foreign currency exposures are reviewed quarterly. Based on the anticipated and committed foreign currency cash inflows, outflows, and hedging policy for the next twelve months, we estimate that a hypothetical 10 percent strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies through 2025 would increase the 2025 expected net cash inflows by approximately $25. At October 29, 2023, a hypothetical 10 percent strengthening of the U.S. dollar under similar assumptions and calculations indicated a potential $25 increase on the 2024 net cash inflows. The estimated impacts on net cash inflows by currency follow:
​
​
In the financial services operations, our policy is to manage foreign currency risk through hedging strategies if the currency of the borrowings does not match the currency of the receivable portfolio. As a result, a hypothetical 10 percent adverse change in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to all other foreign currencies would not have a material effect on the financial services cash flows.
