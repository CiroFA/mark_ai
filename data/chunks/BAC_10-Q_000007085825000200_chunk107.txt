contractual payments. Excluding fully-insured loans, loans accruing past due 30 days or more of $1.0 billion also remained relatively unchanged.
Of the $225.6 billion in total residential mortgage loans outstanding at March 31, 2025, $64.0 billion, or 28 percent, of loans were originated as interest-only. The outstanding balance of interest-only residential mortgage loans that had entered the amortization period was $3.5 billion, or six percent, at March 31, 2025. Residential mortgage loans that have entered the amortization period generally experience a higher rate of early stage delinquencies and nonperforming status compared to the residential mortgage portfolio as a whole. At March 31, 2025, $68 million, or two percent, of outstanding interest-only residential mortgages that had entered the amortization period were accruing past due 30 days or more compared to $1.0 billion, or less than one percent, for the entire residential mortgage portfolio. In addition, at March 31, 2025, $191
million, or five percent, of outstanding interest-only residential mortgage loans that had entered the amortization period were nonperforming, of which $60 million were contractually current. Loans that have yet to enter the amortization period in our interest-only residential mortgage portfolio are primarily well-collateralized loans to our wealth management clients and have an interest-only period of three years to 10 years. Substantially all of these loans that have yet to enter the amortization period will not be required to make a fully-amortizing payment until 2026 or later.
Table 19 presents outstandings, nonperforming loans and net charge-offs by certain state concentrations for the residential mortgage portfolio. In the New York area, the New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) made up 15 percent
of outstandings at both March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024. The Los Angeles-Long Beach-Santa Ana MSA within California represented 14 percent
of outstandings at both March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024.

Outstandings and nonperforming loans exclude loans accounted for under the fair value option.
Home Equity
At March 31, 2025, the home equity portfolio made up five percent of the consumer portfolio and was comprised of home equity lines of credit (HELOCs), home equity loans and reverse mortgages. HELOCs generally have an initial draw period of 10 years, and after the initial draw period ends, the loans generally convert to 15- or 20-year amortizing loans. We no longer originate home equity loans or reverse mortgages.
At March 31, 2025, 85 percent of the home equity portfolio was in
Consumer Banking
, 10 percent was in
GWIM
and the remainder of the portfolio was in
All Other.
Outstanding balances in the home equity portfolio decreased $71 million during the three months ended March 31, 2025 primarily due to paydowns outpacing draws on existing lines and new originations. Of the
