and higher yields paid to clients, as well as breakage fees incurred as a result of ending certain third-party bank arrangements. Trading revenue decreased for both segments, primarily as a result of lower order flow revenue and commissions, due to lower client trading activity and pricing, partially offset by higher fixed income trading activity. Other revenue decreased for both segments primarily due to lower industry fees, net losses on sales of AFS securities, and gains on the sale of certain investments in 2022, partially offset by lower provision for credit losses on bank loans. These decreases were partially offset by higher asset management and administration fees in both segments, primarily as a result of higher money market fund balances and the elimination of money market fund fee waivers during 2022 and growth in Schwab proprietary fund products, partially offset by lower balances in certain third-party funds.

Occupancy and equipment expense decreased in both segments, primarily due to lower technology equipment and software costs, lower property tax expense, and facility closures in 2023 related to restructuring and the Ameritrade integration.

Regulatory fees and assessments decreased in both segments in 2024, primarily due to an FDIC special assessment recorded during the fourth quarter of 2023, partially offset by additional FDIC special assessments in 2024, as described above.
