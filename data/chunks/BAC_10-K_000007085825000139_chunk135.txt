party information security and open-source or proprietary software defects and vulnerabilities. We must rely on our third parties to adequately detect and promptly report cybersecurity incidents. Their failure could adversely affect our ability to report or respond to cybersecurity incidents effectively or timely.
Due to increasing consolidation, interdependence and complexity of financial entities and technology and information  systems, a cybersecurity threat or incident, information or security breach or technology failure that significantly exposes, degrades, destroys, renders unavailable or compromises the information systems or information of one or more financial entities or third parties could adversely impact us and increase the risk of operational failure and loss, as disparate information systems need to be integrated, often on an accelerated basis. Similarly, any cybersecurity threat or incident, information or security breach or technology failure that significantly exposes, degrades, destroys, renders unavailable or compromises our information systems or information could adversely impact third parties and the critical infrastructure of the financial services industry, thereby creating additional risk for us.
Cybersecurity incidents or information or security breaches could persist for an extended period of time prior to detection, and it often takes additional time to determine the scope, extent, amount and type of impact, including the information altered, destroyed, accessed or otherwise compromised, following which the measures to recover and restore to a business-as-usual state may be difficult to assess and require notification to our clients, government officials and regulators. We have spent and expect to continue to spend significant resources to modify and enhance our protective measures and our capabilities to respond and recover, investigate and remediate software and network defects and vulnerabilities, and defend against, detect and respond to cybersecurity threats and incidents, whether to us, third parties, the industry or businesses generally.
While we and our third parties have experienced cybersecurity incidents, information and security breaches and technology failures, as well as adverse impacts from such events, including as described in this risk factor, we have not experienced material losses or other material consequences relating to cybersecurity incidents, information or security breaches or technology failures, whether directed at us or our third parties. However, we expect to continue to experience such events and impacts ourself and at our third parties with increased frequency and severity due to the evolving threat environment, and there can be no assurance that future cybersecurity incidents, information and security breaches and technology failures, including as a result of cybersecurity incidents, information and security breaches and technology failures experienced by our third parties, will not
