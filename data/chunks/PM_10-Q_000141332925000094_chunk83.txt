claim. In February 2025, the FDA formally accepted our MRTPAs. As these applications proceed through the review process, the FDA may request additional information or conduct subsequent inspections to verify the submitted information.
On July 17, 2023, Swedish Match USA, Inc. submitted a renewal application to the FDA requesting re-authorization to continue to market its eight snus smokeless tobacco products (sold under the
General
snus brand name) with a modified risk claim.
General
snus products received modified risk orders on October 22, 2019. Swedish Match USA, Inc. was authorized to market these products with the claim, “Using
General
snus instead of cigarettes puts you at a lower risk of mouth cancer, heart disease, lung cancer, stroke, emphysema, and chronic bronchitis.” On November 7, 2024, the FDA renewed the
General
snus modified risk orders, with a stated expiration date in November 2032.
Other Commercialization and Risk Statement Authorization Frameworks
: On March 22, 2023, a bill amending the Tobacco Hazards Prevention and Control Act in Taiwan went into effect. It regulates heated tobacco products and bans e-cigarettes. The amendment particularly specifies that designated tobacco products (including heated tobacco products) that are not cigarettes, cut tobacco, cigars, snuff nor chewing tobacco, must undergo a health risk assessment as part of an authorization system. We have filed an authorization request to commercialize
IQOS
in Taiwan pursuant to this Act, but this request is currently still pending authorization by the Ministry of Health of Taiwan.
On March 23, 2023, the Greek Ministry of Health authorized a claim for
IQOS
with
HEETS AMBER
to inform Greek
IQOS
users about reduction in emissions of toxicants when using such product compared to cigarette smoking. The decision authorized the following claim: “The concentration of chemical substances with recognized toxicity produced when using
IQOS
with
HEETS
AMBER
tobacco sticks is lower compared to conventional smoking. A reduction in the concentration of chemical substances with recognized toxicity does not mean a corresponding reduction in risk for health. The aerosol of this tobacco

product contains nicotine and other hazardous chemicals. This tobacco product harms your health and is addictive. The best choice is to quit tobacco and nicotine use altogether.” With this authorization, Greece is the second country officially recognizing the reduction in level of toxicants in the
IQOS
aerosol compared to cigarette smoke. In February of 2025, the Greek Ministry of Health authorized a substantially similar claim and disclaimer for
IQOS ILUMA
devices with seven
TEREA
variants (Amber, Bronze, Russet, Sienna, Silver, Teak and Yellow).
