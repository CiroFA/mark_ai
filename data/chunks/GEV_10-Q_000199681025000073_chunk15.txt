incurred and its fair value can be reasonably estimated. These obligations primarily represent nuclear decommissioning, legal
obligations to return leased premises to their initial state, or dismantle and repair specific alterations for certain leased sites. The liability is
measured at the present value of the obligation when incurred and is adjusted in subsequent periods. Corresponding asset retirement costs
are capitalized as part of the carrying value of the related long-lived assets and depreciated over the assetâ€™s useful life. Our asset
retirement obligations were
$
525
million
and
$
622
million
as of
March 31, 2025
a
nd December 31, 2024
, respectively, and are recorded in
All other current liabilities and All other liabilities in our Consolidated and Combined Statement of Financial Position. Of these amounts,
$
440
million
and
$
546
million
were related to nuclear decommissioning obligations. The
decrease
in the liability balance was primarily due
to a settlement of a nuclear decommissioning obligation during the
three months ended
March 31, 2025

RESTRUCTURING CHARGES AND SEPARATION COSTS
Restructuring and Other Charges.
The Company has undertaken or committed to various restructuring initiatives, including workforce
reductions and the consolidation of manufacturing and service facilities. Restructuring and other charges primarily include employee-related
termination benefits associated with workforce reductions, facility exit costs, asset write-downs, and cease-use costs. We expect the
majority of costs to be incurred within
two years
of the commitment of a restructuring initiative.
This table is inclusive of all restructuring charges and the charges are shown below for the business where they originated. Separately, in
our reported segment results, major restructuring programs are excluded from measurement of segment operating performance for internal
and external purposes; those excluded amounts are reported in Restructuring and other charges. See Note
