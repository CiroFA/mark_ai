of our products are used with drug delivery or companion diagnostic devices that have their own regulatory, manufacturing and other risks.
If regulatory agencies determine that we or other parties (including our clinical trial investigators, those operating our patient support programs or licensees of our products) have not complied with the applicable reporting, other pharmacovigilance or other safety or quality assessment requirements, we may become subject to additional inspections, warning letters or other enforcement actions, including fines, marketing authorization withdrawal and other penalties. Our product candidates and marketed products can also be affected by safety problems or signals occurring with respect to products that are similar to ours or that implicate an entire class of products. Further, as a result of clinical trials, including sub-analyses or meta-analyses of earlier clinical trials (a meta-analysis involves the use of various statistical methods to combine results from previous separate but related studies) performed by us or others, concerns may arise about the sufficiency of the data or studies underlying a product’s approved label. Such actual or perceived safety problems or concerns can lead to:
•
revised or restrictive labeling for our products, or the potential for restrictive labeling that has resulted, and may in the future result, in our decision not to commercialize a product candidate;
•
requirement of risk management or minimization activities or other regulatory agency compliance actions related to the promotion and sale of our products;
•
post-marketing commitments, mandated post-marketing requirements or pharmacovigilance programs for our approved products;
•
product recalls of our approved products;

•
required changes to the processes used in the manufacture of our products, which could increase our manufacturing costs and affect the availability of contract manufacturers we may utilize to assist in such manufacturing;
•
revocation of approval for our products from the market completely, or within particular therapeutic areas or patient types;
•
increased timelines or delays in being approved by the FDA or other regulatory bodies; and/or
•
treatments or product candidates not being approved by regulatory bodies.
For example, after an imbalance in positively adjudicated cardiovascular serious adverse events was observed in one of the phase 3 clinical trials for EVENITY but not in another, larger phase 3 study, in April 2019 the FDA approved EVENITY for the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women at high risk for fracture, along with a post-marketing requirement. The requirement includes a five-year observational feasibility study that could be followed by a comparative safety study or trial.
Regulatory authorities also require that our products are tested and controlled for impurities. Impurities exceeding established limits may lead to delayed product approvals or disrupt the manufacture and
