MedSurg and Neurotechnology operating income as a

in the

2025
from
27.3%
in
2024
. Orthopaedics operating income as a
percentage of net sales
increased
to
27.2%
in the
three months
2025
from
26.2%
in
2024
. The key components of the change
were:
The
increase
in MedSurg and Neurotechnology operating income
as a percentage of net sales for the
three months
was primarily
driven by
lower
manufacturing and supply chain costs and
higher
unit volumes and prices offset by
higher
selling, general and
administrative expenses primarily due to the acquisition of Inari
and continued investments to support our growth.
The
increase
in Orthopaedics operating income as a percentage
of net sales for the
three months
was primarily driven by
higher
unit volumes and
lower
manufacturing and supply chain costs
partially offset by
higher
selling, general and administrative
expenses.
Oth
er Income (Expense), Net
Other income (expense), net was
($73)
and
($49)
in the
three
months
2025
and
2024
. The
increase
in net expense in the
three
months
2025
from
2024
was primarily due to higher interest
expense in
2025
partially offset by higher interest income.
Income Taxes
Our effective tax rates were
14.4%
and
14.6%
in the
three
months
2025
and
2024
. The effective tax rates for the
three
months
2025
and
2024
reflect the continued lower effective
income tax rates as a result of our European operations and
certain discrete tax items.
The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development
(OECD), which represents a coalition of member countries, has
put forth two proposed base erosion and profit shifting
frameworks that revise the existing profit allocation and nexus
rules (Pillar One) and ensure a minimal level of taxation (Pillar
Two). On December 12, 2022 the European Union member
states agreed to implement the Inclusive Frameworkâ€™s global
corporate minimum tax rate of 15%, and various countries within
and outside the European Union have either enacted or proposed
new tax laws implementing Pillar Two in 2024. The OECD
continues to release additional guidance and we anticipate more
countries will enact similar tax laws. Some of the new tax laws
became effective in 2024 while others will be effective
in 2025
and future years
. These tax law changes and any additional
contemplated tax law changes could increase tax expense in
future periods
.
Net Earnings
Net earnings
decreased
to
$654
or
$1.69
per diluted share in the
three months
2025
from
$788
or
$2.05
per diluted share in
2024
.
