COMPETITION.
We believe GE Vernova's businesses' ability to supply the electric power industry with a broad array of advanced
technologies for an intelligent, sustainable power system that help customers accelerate the energy transition is a key differentiator among
various of our competitors. Due to increasing demand exceeding available capacity for products and services that supply the electrical
power industry, we face growing competition from emerging threats. The continuing ability to reduce cycle times and ensure available
capacity is expected to
allow us
to remain competitive as demand for our products and services grows significantly. In addition, continued
investment in our products and services and emerging technologies is necessary for us to successfully compete and deliver economic
value and performance to our customers through efficiency, reliability, and affordability.
Our businesses operate in highly competitive markets. We compete based on product performance, quality, branding, service and/or price
across the industries and geographies served. Various companies compete with us across single or multiple products and services.

Key Wind segment competitors include Vestas, Siemens-Gamesa, and Nordex.
Key Electrification segment competitors include Hitachi Energy, Siemens Energy, Siemens, Schneider Electric, Mitsubishi Electric, and
ABB.
