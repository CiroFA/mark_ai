Book-to-bill: Average of the ratio of firm customer orders to Net sales for the last four quarters
Electrical Americas
The increase in organic sales in the first quarter of 2025 was due to strength in data center and utility end-markets, partially offset by weakness in industrial and residential end-markets.
The operating margin increased from 29.2% in the first quarter of 2024 to 30.0% in the first quarter of 2025. Material factors affecting this increase were a 370 basis point increase from higher sales and a 100 basis point increase from operating efficiencies, partially offset by a 190 basis point decline from higher commodity and wage inflation, a 140 basis point decline from unfavorable product mix, and a 110 basis point decline from higher costs to support growth initiatives.
