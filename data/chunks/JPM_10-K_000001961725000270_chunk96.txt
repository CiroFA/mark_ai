could in the future be, required to:
•
limit the products and services that it offers
•
reduce the liquidity that it can provide through its market-making activities
•
refrain from engaging in business opportunities that it might otherwise pursue
•
pay higher taxes (including as part of any minimum global tax regime), assessments, levies or other governmental charges, including in connection with the resolution of tax examinations
•
incur losses, including with respect to fraudulent transactions perpetrated against its customers
•
dispose of certain assets, and do so at times or prices that are disadvantageous
•
impose restrictions on certain business activities, or
•
increase the prices that it charges for products and services, which could reduce the demand for them.
Any failure by JPMorganChase to comply with the laws, rules and regulations to which it is subject could result in:
•
increased regulatory and supervisory scrutiny
•
regulatory and governmental enforcement actions
•
the imposition of fines, penalties or other sanctions
•
increased exposure to litigation, or
•
harm to its reputation.
Part I
Differences and inconsistencies in financial services regulation and supervision can negatively impact JPMorganChase’s businesses, operations and financial results.
The content and application of laws, rules and regulations affecting financial services firms can vary according to factors such as the size of the firm, the jurisdiction in which it is organized or operates, and other criteria. For example:
•
larger firms such as JPMorganChase are often subject to more stringent supervision, regulation and regulatory scrutiny
•
financial technology companies and other non-traditional competitors may not be subject to banking regulation, or may be supervised by a national or state regulatory agency that does not have the same resources or regulatory priorities as the regulatory agencies that supervise more diversified financial services firms, or
•
the financial services regulatory and supervisory framework in a particular jurisdiction may favor financial institutions that are based in that jurisdiction.
These types of differences in the regulatory and supervisory framework can result in JPMorganChase losing market share to competitors that are less regulated or not subject to regulation, especially with respect to unregulated financial products.
There can also be significant differences in the ways that similar regulatory initiatives affecting the financial services industry are implemented in the U.S. and in other countries and regions in which JPMorganChase does business. For example, when adopting rules that are intended to implement a global regulatory or supervisory standard, a national regulator may introduce additional or more restrictive requirements, which can create competitive disadvantages for financial services firms, such as JPMorganChase, that may be subject to those enhanced regulations.
In addition, certain national and multi-
