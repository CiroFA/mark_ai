to higher net unfavorable cumulative contract catch-up adjustments on major fixed-price development programs. BGS revenues increased by $827 million primarily due to higher commercial services revenue.
Revenues increased by $11,186 million in 2023 compared with 2022 driven by higher revenues at all three operating segments. BCA revenues increased by $7,875 million primarily driven by higher 787 deliveries. BDS revenues increased by $1,771 million primarily due to higher revenues on fixed-price development programs. BGS revenues increased by $1,516 million primarily due to higher commercial services revenue driven by market recovery across the commercial portfolio.
We expect that revenues will continue to be significantly impacted until deliveries ramp up, the global supply chain stabilizes, and labor instability diminishes.

The FAS/CAS service cost adjustment represents the difference between the FAS pension and postretirement service costs calculated under GAAP and costs allocated to the business segments.

Core operating loss is a non-GAAP measure that excludes the FAS/CAS service cost adjustment. See pages 46 - 48.
Loss from operations increased by $9,934 million in 2024 compared with 2023. BCA loss from operations increased by $6,334 million primarily due to reach-forward losses on the 777X and 767 programs, 737-9 customer considerations related to the January 2024 grounding, lower deliveries, and lower margins driven by production disruption including the IAM 751 work stoppage and new agreement, and higher research and development expense, partially offset by lower abnormal production costs. BDS loss from operations increased by $3,649 million compared to the same period in 2023 primarily due to higher net unfavorable cumulative contract catch-up adjustments in 2024 on major fixed-price development programs. BGS earnings from operations increased by $289 million in 2024 compared with 2023 primarily due to higher commercial services revenue. Loss from operations on Unallocated items, eliminations and other increased by $288 million in 2024 primarily due to an increase in eliminations and other unallocated items expense, partially offset by an increase in share-based plans income.
Loss from operations decreased by $2,746 million in 2023 compared with 2022. BDS loss from operations decreased by $1,780 million compared to the same period in 2022, primarily due to a reduction in net unfavorable cumulative contract catch-up adjustments, which were $2,328 million better than the net unfavorable impact in the prior year. BCA loss from operations decreased by $706 million reflecting higher deliveries and lower period expenses including lower abnormal production costs, partially offset by higher spending on research and development. BGS earnings from operations increased by $602 million in 2023 compared with 2022 primarily due to higher commercial
