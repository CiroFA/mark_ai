Operating lease obligations of $29.1 billion and Finance lease obligations of $2.5 billion, of which $5.0 billion and $954 million, respectively, are expected to be due within the next twelve months. In addition, Verizon has an obligation of $3.7 billion representing future minimum payments under the leaseback and sublease arrangements for our cell towers, of which $447 million is expected to be due within the next twelve months. See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
•
Unconditional purchase obligations, with terms in excess of one year, amount to $16.7 billion, of which $6.2 billion is expected to be due within the next twelve months. Items included in unconditional purchase obligations are primarily commitments to purchase content, network equipment, software and services, marketing services and other items which will be used or sold in the ordinary course of business. These amounts do not represent our entire anticipated purchases in the future, but represent only those items that are the subject of contractual obligations. We also purchase products and services as needed with no firm commitment. See Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
•
Other long-term liabilities, including current maturities, of $3.9 billion, of which approximately $726 million is expected to be due within the next twelve months. Other long-term liabilities represent estimated postretirement benefit and qualified pension plan contributions. Qualified pension plan contributions include estimated minimum funding contributions. We expect that there will be no required pension funding through the end of 2025, subject to changes in market conditions. Postretirement benefit payments include future postretirement benefit payments. These estimated amounts: (1) are subject to change based on changes to assumptions and future plan performance, which could impact the timing and/or amounts of these payments; and (2) exclude expectations beyond 5 years due to uncertainty of the timing and amounts.
