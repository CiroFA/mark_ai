discontinuing
the active conduct of our trade or business, the issuance or sale of stock or other securities (including securities convertible into our stock
but excluding certain compensatory arrangements), and sales of assets outside the ordinary course of business. These covenants and
indemnification obligations may limit our ability to pursue strategic transactions or engage in new businesses or other transactions that may
maximize the value of our business, and might discourage or delay a strategic transaction that our stockholders may consider favorable.

Statement.
We may be unable to achieve some or all of the benefits that we expect to achieve from the Spin-Off.
We may be unable to achieve
the full strategic and financial benefits expected to result from the separation and distribution, or such benefits may be delayed or not occur
at all. We believe that, as an independent, publicly traded company, we are able to, among other things, more effectively focus on our own
distinct operating priorities and strategies, better address specific market dynamics and target innovation, create incentives for our
management and employees that align more closely with our business performance and the interests of our stockholders, achieve
operational simplification and cost savings, and articulate a clear investment proposition and tailored capital allocation policy to attract a
long-term investor base best suited to our business needs. We may be unable to achieve some or all of the benefits that we expect to
achieve as an independent company in the time we expect, if at all, for a variety of reasons, including: (i) compliance with the requirements
of being an independent, publicly traded company require significant amounts of our management’s time and effort, which may divert
management’s attention from operating and growing our business; (ii) we may be more susceptible to market fluctuations, actions by
activist stockholders, and other adverse events than if we were still a part of GE; (iii) our businesses are less diversified than GE’s
businesses prior to the separation; (iv) the actions required to separate GE’s and our respective businesses could disrupt our operations;
and (v) under the terms of the Tax Matters Agreement, we are restricted from taking certain actions that could cause the Spin-Off to fail to
qualify as a tax-free transaction and these restrictions may limit us for a period of time from pursuing strategic transactions and equity
issuances or engaging in other transactions that may increase the value of our business. If we fail to achieve some or all of the benefits that
we expect to achieve as an independent company, or do not achieve them in the time we expect, our business, financial condition, cash
flows, and results of operations could be adversely affected.
We could incur substantial additional costs and
