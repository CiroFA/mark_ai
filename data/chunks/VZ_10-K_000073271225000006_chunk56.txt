of these allegations, which cannot be reasonably estimated at this time but could be material.
In addition, negative assertions about the health or environmental impact of our lead sheathed cables may harm our reputation, which could adversely affect our business and our relationship with various stakeholders, even if such allegations ultimately prove to be inaccurate.
Verizon has significant debt, which could increase further if we incur additional debt in the future and do not retire existing debt.
As of December 31, 2024, Verizon had approximately $117.9 billion of outstanding unsecured indebtedness, $12.0 billion of unused borrowing capacity under our existing revolving credit facility and $26.1 billion of outstanding secured indebtedness. Our debt level and related debt service obligations could have negative consequences, including:
•
requiring us to dedicate significant cash flow from operations to the payment of principal, interest and other amounts payable on our debt, which would reduce the funds we have available for other purposes, such as working capital, capital expenditures, dividend payments and acquisitions;
•
making it more difficult or expensive for us to obtain any necessary future financing for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, debt refinancing, acquisitions or other purposes and limiting our ability to repurchase common stock;
•
reducing our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our industries and market conditions;
•
making us more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in our business; and
•
exposing us to increased interest rate risk to the extent that (i) our debt obligations are subject to variable interest rates or (ii) we need to refinance existing debt that bears interest at a rate lower than current market rates.
Our initiatives aimed at reducing our indebtedness and achieving any target leverage ratio may be unsuccessful due to macroeconomic, business and other factors.
Adverse changes in the financial markets and other factors could increase our borrowing costs and reduce the availability of financing.
We require a significant amount of capital to operate and grow our business. We fund our capital needs in part through borrowings in the public and private credit markets. Adverse changes in the financial markets, including increases in interest rates or changes in exchange rates, could increase our cost of borrowing, require us to post a significant amount of collateral, and/or make it more difficult for us to obtain financing for our operations or refinance existing indebtedness. In addition, our ability to obtain funding under asset-backed debt transactions is subject to our ability to continue to originate a sufficient amount of assets eligible to be securitized. Our borrowing costs also can be affected by short- and long-term debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies, which are based, in significant part, on our performance as measured by customary
