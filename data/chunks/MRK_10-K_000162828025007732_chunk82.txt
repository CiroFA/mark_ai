MK-3475,
Keytruda
, is an anti-PD-1 therapy approved for the treatment of many cancers that is in clinical development for expanded indications. These studies encompass more than 30 cancer types including: biliary, estrogen receptor positive breast, triple-negative breast, cervical, colorectal, endometrial, esophageal, gastric, glioblastoma, head and neck, hepatocellular, Hodgkin lymphoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, non-small-cell lung, small-cell lung, melanoma, malignant pleural mesothelioma, ovarian, prostate, renal, and urothelial, several of which are currently in Phase 3 clinical development. Further trials are being planned for other cancers.
Keytruda
is under review in the EU and Japan for the first-line treatment of adult patients with unresectable advanced or metastatic malignant pleural mesothelioma, based on the Phase 2/3 IND.227/KEYNOTE-483 trial. In November 2024, the EMA’s CHMP adopted a positive opinion recommending approval of
Keytruda
in combination with pemetrexed and platinum chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of adult patients with unresectable non-epithelioid malignant pleural mesothelioma. In December 2024, the Company requested a re-examination from the EMA’s CHMP for an extension of the indication to include approval in combination with pemetrexed and platinum chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of adults and adolescents aged 12 years and older with unresectable advanced or metastatic malignant pleural mesothelioma, based on final results from the KEYNOTE-483 trial.
The Company is diversifying its oncology portfolio and executing on its strategy which is broadly based on three strategic pillars: immuno-oncology, precision molecular targeting and tissue targeting. Merck has numerous Phase 3 oncology programs within these pillars.
