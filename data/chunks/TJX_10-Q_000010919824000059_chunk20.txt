The Company has
two
TJX revolving credit facilities, a $
1
billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility maturing in June 2026 (the “2026 Revolving Credit Facility”) and a $
500
million revolving credit facility that was set to mature in May 2024 (the “2024 Revolving Credit Facility”). On May 8, 2023, the Company amended the 2024 Revolving Credit Facility (as amended, the “2028 Revolving Credit Facility”) to (i) extend the maturity to May 8, 2028 and (ii) replace the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) with a term secured overnight financing rate plus a
0.10
