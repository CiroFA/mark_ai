contractual arrangements with us;
•
changes in key decision makers within these organizations that may negatively impact our ability to negotiate in the future;
•
customer IT departments may perceive that our platforms and services pose a threat to their internal control and advocate for legacy or internally developed solutions over our platforms;
•
resources may be spent on a potential customer that ultimately elects not to purchase our platforms and services;
•
challenges in successfully identifying, evaluating, and collaborating or teaming with one or more third-party partners or suppliers in order to jointly pursue, secure, and perform under large or complex customer contracts, including certain government procurement programs;
•
more stringent requirements in our service contracts, including stricter service response times, and increased penalties for any failure to meet service requirements;
•
increased competition from larger competitors, such as defense contractors, system integrators, or large software and service companies that traditionally target large enterprises and government entities and that may already have purchase commitments from those customers; and
•
less predictability in completing some of our sales than we do with smaller customers.
Large enterprises and government entities often undertake a significant evaluation process that results in a lengthy sales cycle, in some cases over twelve months, requiring approvals of multiple management personnel and more technical personnel than would be typical of a smaller organization. Due to the length, size, scope, and stringent requirements of these evaluations, we typically provide short-term pilot deployments of our platforms, or one or more bootcamps, to prospective customers at no or low cost initially. We sometimes spend substantial time, effort, and money in our sales efforts without producing any sales. The success of the investments that we make in the earlier stages of our sales cycle depends on factors such as our ability to identify potential customers for which our platforms have an opportunity to add significant value to the customer’s organization, our ability to identify and agree with the potential customer on an appropriate pilot deployment to demonstrate the value of our platforms, and whether we successfully execute on such pilot deployment. Even if the pilot deployment is successful, we or the customer could choose not to enter into a larger contract for a variety of reasons. For example, product purchases by large enterprises and government entities are frequently subject to budget constraints, leadership changes, multiple approvals, and unplanned administrative, processing, and other delays, any of which could significantly delay or entirely prevent our realization of sales. Finally, large enterprises and government entities typically (i) have longer implementation cycles, (ii) require greater product functionality and scalability and a broader range of
