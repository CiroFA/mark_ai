Management’s report on internal control over financial reporting
The management of Mastercard Incorporated (“Mastercard”) is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting.  Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  As required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, management has assessed the effectiveness of Mastercard’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024.  In making its assessment, management has utilized the criteria set forth in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).  Management has concluded that, based on its assessment, Mastercard’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2024.  The effectiveness of Mastercard’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears on the next page.  Management’s assessment of, and conclusion on, the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting did not include the internal controls of RF Ultimate Parent, Inc. (“Recorded Future”), which was acquired in December 2024.  Recorded Future is a wholly-owned subsidiary whose total assets and total revenues excluded from management’s assessment of internal controls represented approximately 1% and less than 1%, respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2024.
