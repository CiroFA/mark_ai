primarily of the interest associated with our outstanding debt obligations, including the amortization of debt issuance costs. See Note 6

Interest expense primarily consists of interest on our Notes of $718 million for the year ended December 31, 2024.  The increase in interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023 was due to the increase in debt.
Interest and Other Income (Expense)
Interest and other income (expense) consists primarily of foreign exchange gains and losses on foreign currency denominated balances, gains and losses on certain derivative instruments, and interest earned on cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments.
Interest and other income (expense) increased for the year ended December 31, 2024 primarily due to foreign exchange losses of $18 million, net of the impacts of derivatives and hedging, compared to the losses of $293 million for the corresponding period in 2023.  In the year ended December 31, 2024, the foreign exchange losses were primarily driven by the remeasurement of cash and content liability positions in currencies other than the functional currencies, partially offset by a non-cash gain of $122 million, net of hedging impacts, from the remeasurement of our €5,170 million Senior Notes.  The foreign exchange loss in the year ended December 31, 2023 was primarily driven by a non-cash loss of $176 million from the remeasurement of our Senior Notes denominated in euros, coupled with the remeasurement of cash and content liability positions in currencies other than the functional currencies.
Provision for Income Taxes
The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2024 remained relatively flat as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023.  See Note 10

Liquidity and Capital Resources
Cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term investments increased $2,447 million in the year ended December 31, 2024 primarily due to cash provided by operations, issuance of debt, and proceeds from issuance of common stock, partially offset by the repurchase of stock and repayment of debt.
Debt, net of debt issuance costs and discounts, increased $1,040 million primarily due to the issuance of $1,800 million in additional Senior Notes, partially offset by the repayment upon maturity of the $400 million aggregate principal amount of our 5.750% Senior Notes and the remeasurement of our euro-denominated notes in the year ended December 31, 2024.  The amount of principal and interest due in the next twelve months is $2,487 million.  As of December 31, 2024, no amounts had been borrowed under our $3 billion Revolving Credit Agreement.
