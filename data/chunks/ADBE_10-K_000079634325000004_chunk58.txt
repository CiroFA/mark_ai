rate changes. Our reported ARR results in the current fiscal year are based on currency rates set at the beginning of the year and held constant throughout the year for measurement purposes. We calculate ARR as follows:
Creative ARR exiting fiscal 2024 was $13.85 billion, up from $12.49 billion at the end of fiscal 2023. Document Cloud ARR exiting fiscal 2024 was $3.48 billion, up from $2.84 billion at the end of fiscal 2023. Total Digital Media ARR grew to $17.33 billion at the end of fiscal 2024, up from $15.33 billion at the end of fiscal 2023. Revaluing our ending ARR for fiscal 2024 using currency rates determined at the beginning of fiscal 2025, our Digital Media ARR at the end of fiscal 2024 would be $17.22 billion or approximately $117 million lower than the ARR reported above.
Our success in driving growth in ARR has positively affected our revenue growth. Creative revenue in fiscal 2024 was $12.68 billion, up from $11.52 billion in fiscal 2023, representing 10% year-over-year growth. Document Cloud revenue in fiscal 2024 was $3.18 billion, up from $2.70 billion in fiscal 2023, representing 18% year-over-year growth.
