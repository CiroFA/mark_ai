The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the impairment of the equity investment in RBH is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when developing the fair value estimate of the Company’s investment in RBH; (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management’s significant assumptions related to the discount rate, sales volumes and operating margins related to the fair value of the combustible tobacco product business in Canada and the estimate of the allocation amount of the aggregate global settlement amount as well as the deductibility of the settlement amount payment for income tax purposes in Canada; and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.
Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management’s equity investment impairment assessment, including controls over the valuation of the Company’s investment in RBH. These procedures also included, among others (i) testing management’s process for developing the fair value estimate of the investment in RBH; (ii) evaluating the appropriateness of the discounted cash flow analysis; (iii) testing completeness and accuracy of underlying data used in the discounted cash flow analysis; (iv) evaluating the reasonableness of significant assumptions used by management related to the discount rate, sales volumes and operating margins related to the valuation of the combustible cigarette business and the estimate of the allocation amount of the aggregate global settlement amount; and (v) evaluating the deductibility of the settlement amount payment for income tax purposes in Canada. Evaluating management’s assumptions related to sales volumes and operating margins related to the valuation of the combustible tobacco product business in Canada and the estimate of the allocation amount of the aggregate global settlement amount involved evaluating whether the assumptions used by management were reasonable considering (i) the current economic conditions and recent operating results of RBH; (ii) the consistency with external market and industry data; and (iii) whether the assumptions were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in evaluating (i) the appropriateness of the discounted cash flow analysis; (ii) the reasonableness of the discount rate assumption related to the valuation of the combustible tobacco product business in Canada; and (iii) the deductibility of the settlement amount payment for income tax purposes in Canada.
