expense in 2024 compared to 2023 —
Primarily due to higher mark-to-market gains in 2024 compared to 2023, lower interest cost in 2024 as a result of lower discount rates at year-end 2023 and a higher expected return on plan assets due to a higher asset base at year-end 2023 compared to year-end 2022.

Increase in expense in 2023 compared to 2022 —
Primarily due to lower mark-to-market gains in 2023 compared to 2022 and higher interest cost in 2023 as a result of higher discount rates at year-end 2022.
The primary factors that resulted in mark-to-market losses (gains) for 2024, 2023 and 2022 are described below.  We include the net mark-to-market losses (gains) in Other income (expense) in the Results of Operations.
•
2024 net mark-to-market gain of $154 million
— Primarily due to higher discount rates at the end of 2024 compared to the end of 2023.  This was partially offset by a lower actual return on plan assets compared to the expected return on plan assets (U.S. pension plans had an actual rate of return of 0.7 percent compared to an expected rate of return of 5.7 percent).
•
2023 net mark-to-market gain of $97 million
— Primarily due to higher actual return on plan assets compared to the expected return on plan assets (U.S. pension plans had an actual rate of return of 10.4 percent compared to an expected rate of return of 5.8 percent) and favorable claims experience related to our other postretirement benefit plans.  This was partially offset by lower discount rates at the end of 2023 compared to the end of 2022.
•
2022 net mark-to-market gain of $606 million
— Primarily due to higher discount rates at the end of 2022 compared to the end of 2021.  This was partially offset by a lower actual return on plan assets compared to the expected return on plan assets (U.S. pension plans had an actual loss rate of (22.6) percent compared to an expected rate of return of 4.0 percent).

SENSITIVITY
Foreign Exchange Rate Sensitivity
ME&T operations use foreign currency forward and option contracts to manage unmatched foreign currency cash inflow and outflow.  Our objective is to minimize the risk of exchange rate movements that would reduce the U.S. dollar value of our foreign currency cash flow.  Our policy allows for managing anticipated foreign currency cash flow for up to approximately five years.  Based on the anticipated and firmly committed cash inflow and outflow for our ME&T operations for the next 12 months and the foreign currency derivative instruments in place at year-end, a hypothetical 10 percent weakening of the U.S. dollar relative to all other currencies would adversely affect our expected 2025 cash flow for our ME&T operations by approximately $77 million.  Last year, similar assumptions and calculations yielded a potential $200 million adverse impact on 2024 cash flow.  We determine our net exposures by calculating the difference in cash inflow and outflow by currency and adding or subtracting outstanding foreign
