The average exchange rate for the three-month periods ended March 31, 2025 and 2024 was 1,057.00 and 834.46, respectively, resulting in an increase of 26.7%.
Considering a hypothetical increase of 10% of the Argentine Peso exchange rate against the U.S. dollar on March 31, 2025, the effect on non-functional currency net asset position in our Argentine subsidiaries would have been a foreign exchange loss amounting to approximately $97 million in our Argentine subsidiaries.

Interest
Our earnings and cash flows are also affected by changes in interest rates. These changes could have an impact on the interest rates that financial institutions charge us prior to the time we sell our credit card receivables and on the financial debt that we use to fund Mercado Pago and lending’s operations. As of March 31, 2025, Credit card receivables and other means of payments, net totaled $5,646 million (includes $114 million presented within non-current other assets in the interim condensed consolidated balance sheets). Interest rate fluctuations could also impact interest earned through our lending solution. As of March 31, 2025, loans receivable net of the allowance for doubtful accounts from our lending solution totaled $5,726 million. Interest rate fluctuations could also negatively affect certain of our fixed rate and floating rate investments comprised primarily of time deposits, money market funds and sovereign debt securities. Investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning products carry a degree of interest rate risk. Fixed rate securities may have their fair value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than predicted if interest rates fall.
As of March 31, 2025, our short-term investments amounted to $5,082 million and our long-term investments amounted to $1,321 million. Our short-term investments can be readily converted at any time into cash or into securities with a shorter remaining time to maturity. We determine the appropriate classification of our investments at the time of purchase and re-evaluate such designations as of each balance sheet date.
