Citi’s consumer ACLL is primarily driven by U.S. cards (Branded Cards and Retail Services) in
USPB
. Citi’s total consumer ACLL net release was ($0.1) billion in the first quarter of 2025, primarily driven by lower cards balances, offset by changes in portfolio composition in

Wealth
and
All Other
. This resulted in a March 31, 2025 ACLL balance of $16.0 billion, or 4.14% of total funded consumer loans.
For U.S. cards, the level of reserves relative to total funded loans increased to 8.23% at March 31, 2025, driven by changes in portfolio composition and uncertainty and deterioration in the macroeconomic outlook, compared to 7.93% at December 31, 2024.

Goodwill
Citi tests for goodwill impairment annually as of October 1 (the annual test) and conducts interim assessments between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more-likely-than-not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. These events or circumstances include, among other things, a significant adverse change in the business climate, a decision to sell or dispose of all or a significant portion of a reporting unit or a sustained decrease in Citi’s stock price.
