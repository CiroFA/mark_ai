Significant Unobservable Inputs.
The table below presents the amount of level 3 investments, and ranges and weighted averages of significant unobservable inputs used to value such investments.
In the table above:
•
Ranges represent the significant unobservable inputs that were used in the valuation of each type of investment.
•
Weighted averages are calculated by weighting each input by the relative fair value of the investment.
•
The ranges and weighted averages of these inputs are not representative of the appropriate inputs to use when calculating the fair value of any one investment. For example, the highest multiple for private equity securities is appropriate for valuing a specific private equity security but may not be appropriate for valuing any other private equity security. Accordingly, the ranges of inputs do not represent uncertainty in, or possible ranges of, fair value measurements of level 3 investments.
•
Increases in yield, discount rate, capitalization rate or duration used in the valuation of level 3 investments would have resulted in a lower fair value measurement, while increases in recovery rate or multiples would have resulted in a higher fair value measurement as of both March 2025 and December 2024. Due to the distinctive nature of each level 3 investment, the interrelationship of inputs is not necessarily uniform within each product type.
•
Corporate debt securities, securities backed by real estate and other debt obligations are valued using discounted cash flows, and equity securities are valued using market comparables and discounted cash flows.
•
The fair value of any one instrument may be determined using multiple valuation techniques. For example, market comparables and discounted cash flows may be used together to determine fair value. Therefore, the level 3 balance encompasses both of these techniques.
Level 3 Rollforward.
The table below presents a summary of the changes in fair value for level 3 investments.
In the table above:
•
Changes in fair value are presented for all investments that are classified in level 3 as of the end of the period.
•
Net unrealized gains/(losses) relates to investments that were still held at period-end.
•
Transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy are reported at the beginning of the reporting period in which they occur. If an investment was transferred to level 3 during a reporting period, its entire gain or loss for the period is classified in level 3.
