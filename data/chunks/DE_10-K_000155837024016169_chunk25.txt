For plans in which all or almost all of the plan’s participants are inactive, the amortization period is the remaining life expectancy of the inactive participants.
Contributions
We make any required contributions to the plan assets under applicable regulations and voluntary contributions after evaluating our liquidity position and ability to make tax-deductible contributions. Total contributions to the plans were $
241
in 2024 and $
228
in 2023, which included both required and voluntary contributions and direct benefit payments.
We expect to contribute approximately
$
100
to our pension plans and approximately
$
660
to our OPEB plans in 2025. In November 2024, a committee of our Board of Directors approved a voluntary contribution to a U.S. OPEB plan for up to
$
520
to be made during the first quarter of 2025. This contribution will increase plan assets. The contributions include required and voluntary contributions and direct benefit payments from company funds. We have no significant required contributions to U.S. pension plan assets in 2025 under applicable funding regulations.
