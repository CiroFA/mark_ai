evaluate compliance with information security mandates, adopt and apply our security control framework, and prevent, detect and respond to security incidents. The Cybersecurity Program is periodically reviewed and modified to respond to changing threats and conditions. A dedicated Operational Risk team, which reports to the chief risk officer, provides oversight and challenge of the Cybersecurity Program, independent of Technology Risk, and assesses the operating effectiveness of the program against industry standard frameworks and Board risk appetite-approved operational risk limits and thresholds.
Our process for managing cybersecurity risk includes the critical components of our risk management framework described in the “Overview and Structure of Risk Management,” as well as the following:
•
Training and education, to enable our people to recognize information and cybersecurity threats and respond accordingly;
•
Identity and access management, including entitlement management and production access;
•
Application and software security, including software change management, open source software, and backup and restoration;
•
Infrastructure security, including monitoring our network for known vulnerabilities and signs of unauthorized attempts to access our data and systems;
•
Mobile security, including mobile applications;
•
Data security, including cryptography and encryption, database security, data erasure and media disposal;
•
Cloud computing, including governance and security of cloud applications, and software-as-a-service data onboarding;
•
Technology operations, including change management, incident management, capacity and resilience; and
•
Third-party risk management, including vendor management and governance, and cybersecurity and business resiliency on vendor assessments.
In conjunction with third-party vendors and consultants, we perform risk assessments to gauge the performance of the Cybersecurity Program, to estimate our risk profile and to assess compliance with relevant regulatory requirements. We perform periodic assessments of control efficacy through our internal risk and control self-assessment process, as well as a variety of external technical assessments, including external penetration tests and “red team” engagements where third parties test our defenses. The results of these risk assessments, together with control performance findings, are used to establish priorities, allocate resources, and identify and improve controls. We use third parties, such as outside forensics firms, to augment our cyber incident response capabilities. We have a vendor management program that documents a risk-based framework for managing third-party vendor relationships. Information security risk management is built into our vendor management process, which covers vendor selection, onboarding, performance monitoring and risk management. See “Third-Party Risk” for further information about vendor risk.
