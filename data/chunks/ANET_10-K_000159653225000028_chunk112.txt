Stock Repurchase Programs
From time to time, we repurchase shares of our common stock pursuant to the Repurchase Programs that are funded from working capital. In April 2024, we completed repurchases under our previous $1.0 billion stock repurchase program (“Prior Repurchase Program”).  In May 2024, our board of directors authorized a new $1.2 billion stock repurchase program (“New Repurchase Program” and together with the Prior Repurchase Program, the "Repurchase Programs"), which expires in May 2027. The Repurchase Programs do not obligate us to acquire any of our common stock, and may be suspended or discontinued by the company at any time without prior notice. During the year ended December 31, 2024, we repurchased a total of $279.0 million of our common stock under our New Repurchase Program and $144.6 million of our common stock under our Prior Repurchase Program. As of December 31, 2024, the remaining authorized amount for stock repurchases under the New Repurchase Program was approximately $921.0 million. Refer to Note 6.
