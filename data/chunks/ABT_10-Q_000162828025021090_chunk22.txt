Financial Review — Results of Operations
Abbott’s revenues are derived primarily from the sale of a broad line of healthcare products under short-term receivable arrangements. Patent protection and licenses, technological and performance features, and inclusion of Abbott’s products under a contract most impact which products are sold; price controls, competition and rebates most impact the net selling prices of products; and foreign currency translation impacts the measurement of net sales and costs.
