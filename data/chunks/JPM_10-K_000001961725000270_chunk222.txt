factors, including:
•
Differences in timing among the maturity or repricing of assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet instruments
•
Differences in the amounts of assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet instruments that are maturing or repricing at the same time
•
Differences in the amounts by which short-term and long-term market interest rates change (for example, changes in the slope of the yield curve)
•
The impact of changes in the maturity of various assets, liabilities or off-balance sheet instruments as interest rates change
The Firm manages interest rate exposure related to its assets and liabilities on a consolidated, Firmwide basis. Business units transfer their interest rate risk to Treasury and CIO through funds transfer pricing, which takes into account the elements of interest rate exposure that can be risk-managed in financial markets. These elements include asset and liability balances and contractual rates of interest, contractual principal payment schedules, expected prepayment
experience, interest rate reset dates and maturities, rate indices used for repricing, and any interest rate ceilings or floors for adjustable rate products.
Earnings-at-Risk
One way that the Firm evaluates its structural interest rate risk is through earnings-at-risk. Earnings-at-risk estimates the Firm’s interest rate exposure for a given interest rate scenario. It is presented as a sensitivity to a baseline, which includes net interest income and certain interest rate sensitive fees. The baseline uses market interest rates and, in the case of deposits, pricing assumptions. The Firm conducts simulations of changes to this baseline for interest rate-sensitive assets and liabilities denominated in U.S. dollars and other currencies (“non-U.S. dollar” currencies). These simulations primarily include retained and held-for-sale loans, deposits, deposits with banks and financing activities, investment securities, long-term debt,  related interest rate hedges, and funds transfer pricing of other positions in risk management VaR and other sensitivity-based measures as described on page 142. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2024, these simulations also include hedges of non-U.S. dollar foreign exchange exposures arising from capital investments. Refer to non-U.S. dollar foreign exchange risk on page 149 for more informa
tion.
Earnings-at-risk scenarios estimate the potential change to a baseline over the following 12 months utilizing multiple assumptions. These scenarios include a parallel shift involving changes to both short-term and long-term rates by an equal amount; a steeper yield curve involving holding short-term rates constant and increasing long-term rates; and a flatter yield curve involving increasing short-term rates and holding long-term rates constant or holding short-term rates constant and decreasing long-term rates. These scenarios consider many different factors, including:
•
The impact on exposures as a result of instantaneous changes
