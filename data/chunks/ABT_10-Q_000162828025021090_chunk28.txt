noted below). While it is not feasible to predict the outcome of such pending claims, proceedings, and investigations with certainty, management is of the opinion that their ultimate resolution should not have a material adverse effect on Abbott's financial position, cash flows, or results of operations.
In the 2024 10-K, Abbott reported that it is a defendant in numerous lawsuits alleging that preterm infants developed necrotizing enterocolitis as a result of being administered Abbott’s preterm infant formula products. Abbott further reported in the 2024 10-K that in a trial held in October 2024 involving Abbott and another infant formula manufacturer and the treating hospital as co-defendants, a jury in a Missouri state court returned a unanimous verdict for Abbott and its co-defendants and that in December 2024, the plaintiff filed a motion for a new trial. In March 2025, the Missouri state court granted the plaintiff’s motion for a new trial, and Abbott appealed the ruling to the Missouri Court of Appeals.
