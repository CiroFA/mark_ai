earnings per share because their effect was antidilutive.
Our unvested restricted stock unit awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents are considered participating securities and historically have been included in the calculation pursuant to the two-class method. For the three months ended March 31, 2025, such participating securities had an insignificant effect. Effective the second quarter of 2024, the Company calculates earnings per share using the treasury stock method. For the three months ended March 31, 2024, application of two-class method had an insignificant effect.

RESTRUCTURING CHARGES AND SEPARATION COSTS
RESTRUCTURING AND OTHER CHARGES.
This table is inclusive of all restructuring charges in our segments and at Corporate & Other. Separately, in our reported segment results, significant, higher-cost restructuring programs, primarily related to the separations, are excluded from measurement of segment operating performance for internal and external purposes; those excluded amounts are reported in Restructuring and other charges for Corporate & Other.
(a) Primarily related to employee severance payments.
The restructuring liability as of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024 was $
218
million and $
242
million, respectively.
For the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, restructuring and other charges for ongoing programs primarily included exit activities announced in the fourth quarter of 2022, reflecting lower Corporate & Other shared-service and footprint needs as a result of the GE HealthCare and GE Vernova spin-offs.
SEPARATION COSTS.
In November 2021, the Company announced its plan to form three industry-leading, global public companies focused on the growth sectors of aerospace, healthcare and energy. As discussed in Note 2, we completed this plan with the spin of GE Vernova in the second quarter of 2024. Post-separation, we expect to continue to incur operational and transition costs related to ongoing separation activities, including employee costs, professional fees, costs to establish certain stand-alone functions and information technology systems, and other transformation to transition to a stand-alone public company. These costs are presented as separation costs in our Statement of Operations.
For the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, we incurred pre-tax separation expense of $
51
million and $
259
million, recognized $
10
million and $
34
million of net tax benefits and paid $
76
million and $
165
million in cash, respectively.
The pre-tax separation costs specifically identifiable to GE HealthCare and GE Vernova are reflected in discontinued operations. We incurred insignificant costs for both GE Healthcare and GE Vernova for the three months ended March 31, 2025, as well as for GE Healthcare for the three months ended March 31, 2024.  Additionally, we incurred $
97
million pre-tax separation costs,
