adequately and timely manufacture and supply our products (and product candidates to support our clinical trials) is dependent on the uninterrupted and efficient operation of our facilities and those of our third-party contract manufacturers, which may be affected by:
•
capacity of manufacturing facilities;
•
contamination by microorganisms or viruses, or foreign particles from the manufacturing process;
•
natural or other disasters, including hurricanes, earthquakes, volcanoes or fires;
•
labor disputes or shortages, including the effects of health emergencies (such as novel viruses or pandemics) or natural disasters;
•
compliance with regulatory requirements;
•
changes in forecasts of future demand;
•
timing and actual number of production runs and production success rates and yields;
•
updates of manufacturing specifications;
•
contractual disputes with our suppliers and contract manufacturers;
•
timing and outcome of product quality testing;
•
power failures and/or other utility failures;
•
cyberattacks on supplier systems;
•
breakdown, failure, substandard performance or improper installation or operation of equipment (including our information technology systems and network-connected control systems or those of our contract manufacturers or third-party service providers);
•
delays in the ability of the FDA or foreign regulatory agencies to provide us necessary reviews, inspections and approvals, including as a result of a subsequent extended U.S. federal or other government shutdowns; and/or
•
geopolitical conflicts (such as the ongoing conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East).
If any of these or other problems affect production in one or more of our facilities or those of our third-party contract manufacturers, or if we do not accurately forecast demand for our products or the amount of our product candidates required in clinical trials, we may be unable to start or increase production in our unaffected facilities to meet demand. If the efficient manufacture and supply of our products or product candidates is interrupted, we may experience delayed shipments, delays in our clinical trials, supply constraints, stock-outs, adverse event trends, contract disputes and/or recalls of our products. From time to time, we have initiated recalls of certain lots of our products. For example, in July 2014 we initiated a voluntary recall of an Aranesp lot distributed in the EU after particles were detected in a quality control sample following distribution of that lot, and in April 2018 we initiated a precautionary recall of two batches of Vectibix distributed in Switzerland after potential crimping defects were discovered in the metal seals on some product vials. If we are at any time unable to provide an uninterrupted supply of our products to patients, we may lose patients and physicians may elect to prescribe competing

therapeutics instead of our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of
