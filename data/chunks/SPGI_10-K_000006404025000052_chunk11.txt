negligence or malfeasance, the use of malicious codes or worms, payment fraud, and other unauthorized occurrences on, or conducted through, our or our third-party service providers’ (including our vendors’) information systems and networks, originating from a wide variety of sources, including criminals, terrorists, nation states, financially motivated actors, internal actors, and external service providers. The cyber risks the Company faces range from cyber attacks common to most industries, to more sophisticated and targeted attacks, including attacks carried out by state-sponsored actors, intended to obtain unauthorized access to certain information or information systems or networks due in part to our prominence in the global marketplace, such as our ratings on debt issued by sovereigns and corporate issuers, our impending methodology changes in our benchmarks businesses, or the composition of our indices. Our third-party service providers, including our vendors, are also the subject of a variety of cyber attacks, including attacks carried out by state-sponsored actors.
•
We and our third-party service providers, including our vendors, experience cyber attacks, data breaches and other cyber threats of varying degrees on a regular basis. The volume of such attacks, breaches and threats has increased over the years and we expect that volume to continue to increase. Breaches of our or our third-party service providers’ (including our vendors’) information systems and networks may cause material interruptions or malfunctions in our or such third-party’s websites, applications or data processing, or may compromise the confidentiality and integrity of material information regarding us, our business or our customers. Although we have not experienced a cyber attack or data breach that has had a material adverse effect on us, we may experience such an event in the future.
•
In the ordinary course of business, we are exposed to vulnerabilities in widely deployed third-party software. While such vulnerabilities have not resulted in a material adverse effect on the Company, they require us to devote time and resources to remediation on a regular basis. Notwithstanding our efforts, we may suffer a material adverse effect resulting from such vulnerabilities in the future.
•
Misappropriation, improper modification, destruction, corruption or unavailability of our data and information, including personal data, due to cyber incidents, attacks or other security breaches, or the perception of such an occurrence, could damage our brand and reputation, result in litigation, regulatory actions, sanctions or other statutory penalties, or lead to loss of customer confidence in our security measures and reliability.  While such incidents have not had a material impact on the Company to date, future incidents could materially harm our ability to retain customers and gain new ones, result in financial losses that are either not insured against or not fully covered
