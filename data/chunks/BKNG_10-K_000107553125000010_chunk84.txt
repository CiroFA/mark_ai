Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Item 9B. Other Information
Disclosure pursuant to Section 219 of the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012 and 13(r) of the Exchange Act
As previously reported in the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on August 1, 2024, the following activities are disclosed as required by Section 219 of the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012 and Section 13(r) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The Company has determined that a limited number of bookings were made through Agoda at accommodations in Iran that were ultimately owned or controlled by the Government of Iran and covered by the travel exemption in applicable U.S. sanctions regulations, as well as one booking at a property that may be owned by a party blocked pursuant to Executive Order No. 13224, for which the travel exemption is not available (the Company has notified, and intends to cooperate with, relevant authorities regarding this booking). The bookings resulted in gross revenues of approximately $1,000 and no net profit. Agoda does not intend to continue these activities or transactions.
