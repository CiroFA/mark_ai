comprehensive loss within common shareholders’ equity. If this net accumulated gain or loss exceeds
10
% of the greater of the market-related value of plan assets or plan obligations, a portion of the net gain or loss is included in other pension and retiree medical benefits (expense)/income for the following year based upon the average remaining service life for participants in PepsiCo Employees Retirement Hourly Plan (Plan H) (approximately
11
years) and retiree medical (approximately
11
years), and the remaining life expectancy for participants in Plan I (approximately
26
years).
The cost or benefit of plan changes that increase or decrease benefits for prior employee service (prior service cost/(credit)) is included in other pension and retiree medical benefits (expense)/income on a straight-line basis over the average remaining service life for participants in Plan H, and the remaining life expectancy for participants in Plan I, except that prior service cost/(credit) for salaried participants subject to the benefit accruals freeze effective December 31, 2025 is amortized on a straight-line basis over the period up to the effective date of the freeze.

The amount we report in operating profit as pension and retiree medical cost is service cost, which is the value of benefits earned by employees for working during the year.
The amounts we report below operating profit as pension and retiree medical cost consist of the following components:
•
Interest cost is the accrued interest on the projected benefit obligation due to the passage of time.
•
Expected return on plan assets is the long-term return we expect to earn on plan investments for our funded plans that will be used to settle future benefit obligations.
•
Amortization of prior service cost/(credit) represents the recognition in the income statement of benefit changes resulting from plan amendments.
•
Amortization of net loss/(gain) represents the recognition in the income statement of changes in the amount of plan assets and the projected benefit obligation based on changes in assumptions and actual experience.
•
Settlement/curtailment loss/(gain) represents the result of actions that effectively eliminate all or a portion of related projected benefit obligations. Settlements are triggered when payouts to settle the projected benefit obligation of a plan due to lump sums or other events exceed the total of annual service and interest cost. Settlements are recognized when actions are irrevocable and we are relieved of the primary responsibility and risk for projected benefit
