Warrants were, and the 2025 Warrants are, exercisable over
60
scheduled trading days beginning October 2023 and September 2025, respectively.
The following table presents details of our Warrants (in millions, except per share data):
(1)
The 2023 Warrants were net settled during the
60
scheduled trading days from October to December 2023.
The shares issuable under the Warrants are included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share when the average market value per share of our common stock for the reporting period exceeds the applicable strike price for such series of Warrants. The Warrants are separate transactions and are not part of either series of Notes or Note Hedges and are not remeasured through earnings each reporting period. Holders of the Notes of either series will not have any rights with respect to the Warrants. The aggregate proceeds received from the sale of the Warrants are included in additional paid-in capital on our condensed consolidated balance sheets.
During the nine months ended April 30, 2024, we net settled all of the 2023 Warrants with
18.0
million shares of our common stock with a fair value of $
2.4
billion. The number of net shares issued was determined based on the number of 2023 Warrants exercised multiplied by the difference between the strike price of the 2023 Warrants and their daily volume-weighted-average stock price.
