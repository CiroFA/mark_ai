Forward-looking statements are based on currently available information and our current assumptions, expectations and projections about future events. You should not rely on our forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to future events, risks and uncertainties — many of which are beyond our control, dependent on the actions of third parties, or currently unknown to us — as well as potentially inaccurate assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially from our historical experience and our expectations and projections. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those described in

and elsewhere in this report, Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors of the 2023 Form 10-K and elsewhere in the 2023 Form 10-K, and also as described from time to time in reports subsequently filed with the SEC. You should read such information in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes and
Part I, Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
in this report. There also may be other factors that we cannot anticipate or that are not described herein, generally because we do not currently perceive them to be material. Such factors could cause results to differ materially from our expectations. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and we do not undertake to update these statements other than as required by law. You are advised, however, to review any further disclosures we make on related subjects in our filings with the SEC and in our other public statements.
