following proportions: 80 percent—90 percent U.S. equity, and 10 percent—20 percent international equity.
•
Our current hedge portfolio is sensitive only to U.S. equity markets.
•
We would suggest using the S&P 500 index as a proxy for U.S. equity, and the MSCI EAFE index as a proxy for international equity.
•
Interest rate shocks assume a parallel shift in the U.S. yield curve
•
Our liabilities are also sensitive to global interest rates at various points on the yield curve, mainly the U.S. Treasury curve in the following proportions: up to 15 percent short-term rates (maturing in less than 5 years), 15 percent—30 percent medium-term rates (maturing between 5 years and 10 years, inclusive), and 65 percent—80 percent long-term rates (maturing beyond 10 years).
•
A change in AA-rated credit spreads impacts the rate used to discount cash flows in the fair value model. AA-rated credit spreads are a proxy for both our own credit spreads and the credit spreads of the ceding insurers.
•
The hedge sensitivity is from December 31, 2024, market levels and only applicable to the equity and interest rate sensitivities table below.
•
The sensitivities do not scale linearly and may be proportionally greater for larger movements in the market factors. Actual sensitivity of our net income may differ from those disclosed in the tables below due to fluctuations in short-term market movements.

Market Risk Benefits Net Amount at Risk
All our MRB reinsurance treaties include annual or aggregate claim limits and many include an aggregate deductible which limit the net amount at risk under these programs. The tables below present the net amount at risk at December 31, 2024, following an immediate change in equity market levels, assuming all global equity markets are impacted equally.
a) Reinsurance covering the GMDB risk only
The treaty limits function as a ceiling as equity markets fall. As the shocks in the table above become incrementally more negative, the impacts begin to drop due to the specific nature of these claim limits, many of which are annual claim limits calculated as a percentage of the reinsured account value. There is also an impact due to a portion of the reinsurance under which claims are positively correlated to equity markets (claims decrease as equity markets fall).
b) Reinsurance covering the GLB risk only
The treaty limits cause the net amount at risk to increase at a declining rate as equity markets fall.

c) Reinsurance covering both the GMDB and GLB risks on the same underlying policyholders
The treaty limits cause the GMDB and GLB net amount at risk to increase at a declining rate as equity markets fall.
