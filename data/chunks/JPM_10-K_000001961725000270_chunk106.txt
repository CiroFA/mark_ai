by those clients. Sustained adverse economic conditions or hybrid work models could result in reductions in the rental cash flows that owners or developers receive from their tenants which, in turn, could depress the values of the properties, impair the ability of borrowers to service or refinance their commercial real estate loans and lead to an increase in foreclosures. These consequences could result in JPMorganChase experiencing increases in the allowance for credit losses, higher delinquencies, defaults and charge-offs within its commercial real estate loan portfolio and incurring higher costs for servicing a larger volume of delinquent loans in that portfolio. An increase in foreclosures could result in higher operational risk associated with JPMorganChase owning and managing real property,

and any inadequacy in governance or control over the foreclosed properties could result in regulatory scrutiny and reputational harm.
Changes in interest rates and credit spreads can adversely affect JPMorganChase’s earnings, its liquidity or its capital levels.
When interest rates are high or increasing, JPMorganChase can generally be expected to earn higher net interest income. However, higher interest rates can also lead to:
•
fewer originations of commercial and residential real estate loans
•
losses on underwriting exposures or incremental client-specific downgrades, or increases in the allowance for credit losses and net charge-offs due to higher financing costs for clients
•
the loss of deposits, particularly if customers withdraw deposits because they believe that interest rates offered by JPMorganChase are lower than those of competitors or if JPMorganChase makes incorrect assumptions about depositor behavior
•
losses on available-for-sale (“AFS”) securities held in the investment securities portfolio
•
lower net interest income if central banks introduce interest rate increases more quickly than anticipated and this results in a misalignment in the pricing of short-term and long-term borrowings
•
less liquidity in the financial markets, and
•
higher funding costs.
All of these outcomes could adversely affect JPMorganChase’s earnings or its liquidity and capital levels, and any negative outcomes could be more severe in a prolonged period of high interest rates. Higher interest rates can also negatively affect the payment performance on loans within JPMorganChase’s consumer and wholesale loan portfolios that are linked to variable interest rates. If borrowers of variable rate loans are unable to afford higher interest payments, those borrowers may reduce or stop making payments, thereby causing JPMorganChase to incur losses and increased operational costs related to servicing a higher volume of delinquent loans.
On the other hand, a low or negative interest rate environment may cause:
•
net interest margins to be compressed, which could reduce the amounts that JPMorganChase earns on its investment securities portfolio to the extent that it
