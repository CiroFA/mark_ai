CONSOLIDATED SALES AND REVENUES
The chart above graphically illustrates reasons for the change in consolidated sales and revenues between the first quarter of 2024 (at left) and the first quarter of 2025 (at right). Caterpillar management utilizes these charts internally to visually communicate with the company’s board of directors and employees.
Total sales and revenues for the first quarter of 2025 were $14.249 billion, a decrease of $1.550 billion, or 10 percent, compared with $15.799 billion in the first quarter of 2024. The decrease was primarily due to lower sales volume of $1.1 billion and unfavorable price realization of $250 million. Lower sales volume was mainly driven by the impact from changes in dealer inventories. Dealer inventory increased by $100 million during the first quarter of 2025, compared with an increase of $1.4 billion during the first quarter of 2024.

Machine dealer inventory was about flat during the first quarter of 2025, compared with an increase of $1.1 billion during the first quarter of 2024. Dealers are independent, and the reasons for changes in their inventory levels vary, including their expectations of future demand and product delivery times. Dealers’ demand expectations take into account seasonal changes, macroeconomic conditions, machine rentals and other factors. Delivery times can vary based on availability of product from Caterpillar factories and product distribution centers.
