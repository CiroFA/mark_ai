excess of the aggregate principal amount of the notes being exchanged. At December 31, 2024, the exchange rate, which is subject to certain adjustments as set forth in the indenture, is 14.6927 shares of NEE common stock per $1,000 in principal amount of notes, which is equivalent to an exchange price of approximately $
68.06
per share of NEE common stock.
NEECH used $
52
million of the net proceeds from the sale of the notes to enter into capped call transactions. Under the capped call transactions, NEECH purchased capped call options with an initial strike price of $
68.06
and an initial cap price of $
83.34
in each case per share of NEE common stock and subject to adjustment in certain circumstances. The capped call transactions may be settled with cash or, at NEE's election, with shares of NEE common stock. Any capped call settlement value is expected to offset the value to be delivered upon exchange of the notes as a result of share price improvement up to the cap price.
In September 2022, NEE sold $
2.0
billion of equity units (initially consisting of Corporate Units). Each equity unit has a stated amount of $
50
and consists of a contract to purchase NEE common stock (stock purchase contract) and, initially, a
5
% undivided beneficial ownership interest in a Series M Debenture due September 1, 2027, issued in the principal amount of $
1,000
by NEECH. Each stock purchase contract requires the holder to purchase by no later than September 1, 2025 (the final settlement date) for a price of $
50
in cash, a number of shares of NEE common stock (subject to antidilution adjustments) based on a price per share range described in the following sentence. If purchased on the final settlement date, as of December 31, 2024, the number of shares issued per equity unit would (subject to antidilution adjustments) range from
0.5670
shares if the applicable market value of a share of NEE common stock is less than or equal to $
88.88
(the reference price) to
0.4534
shares if the applicable market value of a share is equal to or greater than $
111.10
(the threshold appreciation price), with the applicable market value to be determined using the average closing prices of NEE common stock over a
20
-day trading period ending August 27, 2025. Total annual distributions on the equity units are at the rate of
6.926
%, consisting of interest on the debentures (
4.60
% per year) and payments under the stock purchase contracts (
2.326
% per year). The interest rate on the debentures is expected to be reset on or after March 1, 2025. A holder of an equity unit may satisfy its purchase obligation with proceeds raised from remarketing the NEECH debentures that are part of its equity unit. The undivided beneficial ownership interest in the NEECH debenture that is a component of each Corporate Unit is pledged to NEE to secure the holder's obligation to purchase NEE common stock under the related stock purchase contract. If a successful remarketing does not occur on or
