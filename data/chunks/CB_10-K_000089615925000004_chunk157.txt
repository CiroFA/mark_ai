Reinsurance
a) Consolidated Reinsurance
Chubb purchases reinsurance to manage various exposures including catastrophe risks. Although reinsurance agreements contractually obligate Chubb's reinsurers to reimburse it for the agreed-upon portion of its gross paid losses, they do not discharge Chubb's primary liability. The amounts for net premiums written and net premiums earned in the Consolidated statements of operations are net of reinsurance.
The following table presents direct, assumed, and ceded premiums:
Ceded losses and loss expenses incurred were $
