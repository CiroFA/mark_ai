respectively, in non-marketable equity securities and partnerships.
Though the relative significance of particular categories of capital investment can change from period to period, capital expenditures are typically made for increasing manufacturing capacity, the manufacture of instruments that are used in OTL arrangements that certain of the Company’s businesses enter into with customers, replacing equipment, purchasing facilities, supporting new product development and improving IT systems.  Capital expenditures decreased $46 million on a year-over-year basis for the three-month period ended March 28, 2025 compared to the comparable period in 2024.
Financing Activities and Indebtedness
Cash flows relating to financing activities can consist of cash flows associated with the issuance and repayments of commercial paper, issuance and repayment of long-term debt, borrowings under committed credit facilities, issuance and repurchases of common stock, issuance of preferred stock and payments of cash dividends to shareholders.  Financing activities used cash of approximately $1.3 billion during the three-month period ended March 28, 2025 compared to $133 million of cash used in the comparable period of 2024.  The year-over-year increase in cash used in financing activities was primarily due to the repurchase of approximately $1.1 billion of the Company’s common stock and to a lesser extent, due to net repayments of the Company’s commercial paper in 2025 compared to net borrowings in the comparable period of 2024 and higher dividend payments year-over-year.

As of March 28, 2025, the Company was in compliance with all of its respective debt covenants.

Dividends
Aggregate cash payments for dividends on Company common stock during the three-month period ended March 28, 2025 were $194 million compared to $177 million for the three-month period ended March 29, 2024.  The increase in dividend payments on the Company’s common stock compared to the comparable period of 2024 is due to the increase in the quarterly dividend rate for common stock beginning with respect to the dividend paid in the second quarter of 2024, partially offset by lower average common stock outstanding.
In the first quarter of 2025, the Company declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.32 per share of Company common stock payable on April 25, 2025 to holders of record as of March 28, 2025.
