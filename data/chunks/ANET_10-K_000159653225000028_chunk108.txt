increased by $3.6 million, or 3.0%, for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to 2023.
Other Income, Net (in thousands, except percentages)
Other income (expense), net consists primarily of interest income from our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, and gains and losses on our strategic investments.  We expect other income (expense), net may fluctuate in the future as a result of changes in interest rates, changes in our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances, and the re-measurement of our equity investments upon the occurrence of either observable price changes or impairments.
The favorable movement in other income (expense), net, during the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to 2023 was driven by an increase in interest income of $158.6 million due to an increase in our cash and marketable securities balances, coupled with higher investment yields.
Provision for Income Taxes (in thousands, except percentages)
We operate in a number of tax jurisdictions and are subject to taxes in each country or jurisdiction in which we conduct business. Earnings from our non-U.S. activities are subject to local country income tax and may also be subject to U.S. income tax. Generally, our U.S. tax obligations are reduced by a credit for foreign income taxes paid on these foreign earnings, which avoids double taxation. Our tax expense to date consists of federal, state and foreign current and deferred income taxes.
Our provision for income taxes increased for the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to 2023, while our effective tax rate decreased for the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to 2023. The increase in our income taxes was largely due to an increase in pre-tax income, partly offset by a decrease in our effective tax rate due to favorable changes in state taxes and tax benefits attributable to stock-based compensation. For further information regarding income taxes and the impact on our results of operations and financial position, refer to Note 8. Income Taxes of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
