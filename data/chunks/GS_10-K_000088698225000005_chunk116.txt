.
Provision for credit losses in the consolidated statements of earnings was $1.35 billion for 2024, compared with $1.03 billion for 2023. Provisions for 2024 reflected net provisions related to the credit card portfolio (primarily driven by net charge-offs). Provisions for 2023 reflected net provisions related to both the credit card portfolio (primarily driven by net charge-offs) and wholesale loans (primarily driven by impairments), partially offset by reserve reductions of $637 million related to the transfer of the GreenSky loan portfolio to held for sale and $442 million related to the sale of substantially all of the Marcus loan portfolio.
Operating Expenses
Our operating expenses are primarily influenced by compensation, headcount and levels of business activity. Compensation and benefits includes salaries, year-end discretionary compensation, amortization of equity awards and other items such as benefits. Discretionary compensation is significantly impacted by, among other factors, the level of net revenues, net of provision for credit losses, overall financial performance, prevailing labor markets, business mix, the structure of our share-based awards and the external environment.
The table below presents our operating expenses by line item and headcount.
2024 versus
2023.
Operating expenses in the consolidated statements of earnings were $33.77 billion for 2024, 2% lower than 2023. Our efficiency ratio was 63.1% for 2024, compared with 74.6% for 2023.
Operating expenses, compared with 2023, reflected decreases driven by significantly lower expenses, including impairments ($1.46 billion recognized in 2023), related to commercial real estate in CIEs (largely in depreciation and amortization) and other significant expenses recognized in the prior year, including the write-down of identifiable intangible assets related to GreenSky of $506 million and an impairment of goodwill related to Consumer platforms of $504 million (both in depreciation and amortization), and the FDIC special assessment fee of $529 million (in other expenses). These decreases were partially offset by higher compensation and benefits expenses (reflecting improved operating performance) and higher transaction based expenses. An incremental expense for the FDIC special assessment fee of $71 million was recognized in 2024, as the FDIC notified banks subject to the special assessment fee of the updated estimated cost to the Deposit Insurance Fund resulting from the closures in 2023 of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. Net provisions for litigation and regulatory proceedings were $166 million for 2024 compared with $115 million for 2023.
As of December 2024, headcount increased 3%
