Matters.
In November 2015, we acquired the power and grid businesses of Alstom, which prior to the acquisition
was the subject of significant cases involving anti-competitive activities and improper payments. The estimated liability balance was
$
235
million
and
$
236
million
at
March 31, 2025
and
December 31, 2024
, respectively,
for legal and compliance matters related to the legacy
business practices that were the subject of cases in various jurisdictions. Allegations in these cases relate to claimed anti-competitive
conduct or improper payments in the pre-acquisition period as the source of legal violations or damages. Given the significant litigation and
compliance activity related to these matters and our ongoing efforts to resolve them, it is difficult to assess whether the disbursements will
ultimately be consistent with the estimated liability established. The estimation of this liability may not reflect the full range of uncertainties
and unpredictable outcomes inherent in litigation and investigations of this nature, and at this time we are unable to develop a meaningful
estimate of the range of reasonably possible additional losses beyond the amount of this estimated liability. Factors that can affect the
ultimate amount of losses associated with these and related matters include formulas for determining disgorgement, fines and/or penalties,
the duration and amount of legal and investigative resources applied, political and social influences within each jurisdiction, and tax
consequences of any settlements or previous deductions, among other considerations. Actual losses arising from claims in these and
related matters could exceed the amount
provided.
Environmental and Asset Retirement Obligations.
Our operations involve the use, disposal, and cleanup of substances regulated under
environmental protection laws and nuclear decommissioning regulations. We have obligations for ongoing and future environmental
remediation activities and may incur additional liabilities in connection with previously remediated sites. Additionally, like many other
industrial companies, we and our subsidiaries are defendants in various lawsuits related to alleged worker exposure to asbestos or other
hazardous materials. Liabilities for environmental remediation, nuclear decommissioning, and worker exposure claims exclude possible
insurance recoveries.
It is reasonably possible that our exposure will exceed amounts accrued. However, due to uncertainties about the status of laws,
regulations, technology, and information related to individual sites and lawsuits, such amounts are not reasonably estimable. Our reserves
related to environmental remediation and worker exposure claims recorded in All other liabilities were
$
139
million
and
$
138
million
as of
March 31, 2025
and
December 31, 2024
, respectively.
We record asset retirement obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets as a liability in the period in which the
obligation is
