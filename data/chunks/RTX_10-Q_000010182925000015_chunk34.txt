Net products cost of sales increased $0.1 billion in the quarter ended March 31, 2025 compared to the quarter ended March 31, 2024, primarily driven by increases in external products cost of sales at Collins and Pratt & Whitney, partially offset by a decrease in external products cost of sales at Raytheon, each driven by the products sales changes noted above. The increase was also partially offset by the absence of charges recorded during the first quarter of 2024 at Collins as a result of initiating alternative titanium sources.
Net services cost of sales increased $0.4 billion in the quarter ended March 31, 2025 compared to the quarter ended March 31, 2024, primarily due to an increase in external services cost of sales at Pratt & Whitney, driven by the services sales change noted above, partially offset by a decrease in external services cost of sales at Raytheon, primarily driven by the sale of the CIS business completed in the first quarter of 2024.
