VIEs that primarily relate to certain subsidiaries which have sold differential membership interests in entities which own and operate wind generation, solar generation and battery storage facilities with generating/storage capacity of approximately
10,446
MW,
3,485
MW and
1,719
MW, respectively, and own wind generation and battery storage facilities that, upon completion of construction, which is anticipated in 2025, are expected to have generating/storage capacity of approximately
412
MW and
200
MW, respectively. These entities sell, or will sell, their electric output either under power sales contracts to third parties with expiration dates ranging from 2025 through 2054 or in the spot market. These entities are considered VIEs because the holders of differential membership interests do not have substantive rights over the significant activities of these entities. NextEra Energy Resources has financing obligations with respect to these entities, including third-party debt which is secured by liens against the generation facilities and the other assets of these entities or by pledges of NextEra Energy Resources' ownership interest in these entities. The debt holders have no recourse to the general credit of NextEra Energy Resources for the repayment of debt. The assets and liabilities of these VIEs totaled approximately $
23,902
million and $
1,546
million, respectively, at December 31, 2024. There were
33
of these consolidated VIEs at December 31, 2023 and the assets and liabilities of those VIEs at such date totaled approximately $
