Provision for Income Taxes for the Three Months Ended February 28, 2025 and March 1, 2024
Our effective tax rate decreased by approximately 19 percentage points for the three months ended February 28, 2025, as compared to the three months ended March 1, 2024. The decrease was primarily due to the impact of the Figma acquisition termination fee incurred in the prior year, which was not deductible for financial statement purposes, and an increase in the anticipated benefit from a foreign tax asset in the current year. The decrease was partially offset by a net tax expense related to stock-based compensation recorded during the three months ended February 28, 2025 as compared to a net tax benefit related to stock-based compensation recorded during the year-ago period.
Our effective tax rate for the three months ended February 28, 2025 was lower than the U.S.
