hedging strategies, make correct assumptions, manage and aggregate data correctly and efficiently, identify changes in markets or client behaviors not historically reflected and develop risk management models and forecasts to assess and control risk.
Our risk management depends on our ability to consistently execute all elements of our risk management program, develop and maintain a culture of managing risk well throughout the Corporation and manage third-party risks, including providers of products and services, to allow for effective risk management and help confirm that risks are appropriately considered, evaluated and responded to timely. Uncertain economic and geopolitical conditions, widespread health emergencies and pandemics, heightened legislative and regulatory scrutiny of and change within the financial services industry, the pace of technological changes, including AI (such as machine learning and generative AI) and quantum computing, accounting, tax and market developments, the failure of employees, representatives and third parties to comply with our policies and Risk Framework and the overall complexity of our operations, among other developments, have in the past and may in the future, result in a heightened level of risk, including operational, reputational and compliance risk. Failure to manage evolving risks or properly anticipate, escalate, manage, control or mitigate risks could result in additional legal, regulatory and reputational risk, losses and adversely affect our results of operations.
Regulatory, Compliance and Legal
We are highly regulated and subject to evolving government legislation and regulations and certain settlements, orders and agreements with government authorities from time to time.
We are highly regulated and subject to evolving and comprehensive regulation under federal and state laws in the U.S. and the laws of the various foreign jurisdictions in which we
operate. These laws and regulations significantly affect and have the potential to increase our compliance costs, restrict the scope of our existing businesses, require changes to our employment practices, business strategies and controls and procedures, limit our ability to pursue certain business opportunities, including the products and services we offer, reduce certain fees and rates and/or make our products and services more expensive for our clients. We are also required to file various financial and nonfinancial regulatory reports to comply with LRRs in the jurisdictions in which we operate, which results in additional compliance and operational risk.
We continue to adjust our business and operations, legal entity structure, systems, disclosure, policies, procedures, processes, controls and governance, including with regard to capital and liquidity management, risk management and data management, in an effort to comply with LRRs, and evolving expectations, guidance and interpretation by regulatory authorities, including the Department of
