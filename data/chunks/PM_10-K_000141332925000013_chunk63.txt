Description of Our Company
We are a leading international tobacco company, actively delivering a smoke-free future. We are evolving our portfolio for the long term to include products outside of the tobacco and nicotine sector. Our current product portfolio primarily consists of cigarettes and smoke-free products. Since 2008, we have invested over $14 billion to develop, scientifically substantiate and commercialize innovative smoke-free products for adults who would otherwise continue to smoke, with the goal of completely ending the sale of cigarettes. This investment includes the building of world-class scientific assessment capabilities, notably in the areas of pre-clinical systems toxicology, clinical and behavioral research, as well as post-market studies. In November 2022, we acquired Swedish Match AB ("Swedish Match") – a leader in oral nicotine delivery – creating a global smoke-free combination led by the companies’
IQOS
and
ZYN
brands. Following a robust science-based review, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the "FDA") has authorized the marketing of Swedish Match’s
General
snus and
ZYN
nicotine pouches and versions of PMI’s
IQOS
devices and consumables - the first-ever such authorizations in their respective categories. Versions of
IQOS
devices and consumables
and
General
snus also obtained the first-ever Modified Risk Tobacco Product ("MRTP") authorizations from the FDA. We describe the MRTP orders in more detail in the "Business Environment" section of this Item 7.
Following the combination and the progress in 2023 toward the integration of the Swedish Match business into PMI's existing regional structure, PMI updated in January 2024 its segment reporting by including the former Swedish Match segment results into the four existing geographical segments. Our four geographical segments are as follows:
•
Europe Region;
•
South and Southeast Asia, Commonwealth of Independent States, Middle East and Africa Region ("SSEA, CIS & MEA");
•
East Asia, Australia, and PMI Duty Free Region ("EA, AU & PMI DF"); and
•
Americas Region.
Our Wellness and Healthcare segment ("W&H") remained unchanged in 2024.
Following the sale of Vectura Group Ltd. on December 31, 2024, we will update our segment reporting by including the remaining Wellness & Healthcare results in the Europe segment.  In addition, we will be renaming our “PMI Duty Free” business to “PMI Global Travel Retail” effective in the first quarter of 2025.  As a result of
