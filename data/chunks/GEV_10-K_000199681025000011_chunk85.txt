RPO, a measure of backlog, includes unfilled firm and unconditional customer orders for equipment and services, excluding any purchase
order that provides the customer with the ability to cancel or terminate without incurring a substantive penalty. Services RPO includes the
estimated life of contract sales related to long-term service agreements which remain unsatisfied at the end of the reporting period,
excluding contracts that are not yet active. Services RPO also includes the estimated amount of unsatisfied performance obligations for
time and material agreements, material services agreements, spare parts under purchase order, multi-year maintenance programs, and
other services agreements, excluding any order that provides the customer with the ability to cancel or terminate without incurring a
substantive penalty. See Note

outpacing revenues across all businesses; at Power, due to orders outpacing revenues for Gas Power equipment and services, partially
offset by a reduction of approximately $3.9 billion related to the sale of a portion of Steam Power nuclear activities to EDF; partially offset at
Wind, due to decreases at Offshore Wind as we continue to execute on our contracts and finalized the settlement of a previously canceled
project in the third quarter, and decreases at Onshore Wind due to revenues outpacing orders.
