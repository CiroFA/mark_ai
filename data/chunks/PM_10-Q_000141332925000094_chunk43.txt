ZYN
products in the United States while under the age of 18, (iii) all residents of Florida who used
ZYN

ZYN
products to minors, and misrepresented or failed to disclose to consumers information about
ZYN
products, including information about health risks associated with these products.

On September 24, PMI and Swedish Match North America LLC filed motions to dismiss the complaint with prejudice, and a motion to stay discovery. On October 2, 2024, Plaintiff filed a notice of voluntary dismissal without prejudice as to Swedish Match North America LLC, which the Court ordered on October 3, 2024. On April 11, 2025, PMI filed a motion to stay the proceedings until the court in the
Kelly
case, described above, issues a ruling on any motion for class certification that the plaintiff in that case might bring. At this time, no estimated loss has been accrued in the consolidated financial statements for this proceeding and we cannot determine the likelihood of loss, or reasonably estimate a range of loss, if any, from this proceeding.
