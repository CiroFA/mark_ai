Extended Producer Responsibility ("EPR") schemes, came into force on July 2, 2019. As of December 31, 2024, the majority of EU Member States transposed the directive into national legislation and brought into force mandatory EPR schemes and related EPR costs for tobacco manufacturers and importers. We currently expect further adoption of similar laws in other jurisdictions, and we are monitoring developments in this area. We do not estimate a material impact to our business in the EU as a result of compliance with these mandatory EPR schemes.

SFP Commercialization and Risk Statement Authorizations
Certain markets have instituted regulatory authorization processes that govern the commercialization of SFPs or the use of statements addressing SFP harm-reduction.
FDA Authorization Process and Status of PMI SFPs
: In the United States, an established regulatory framework for assessing “New Tobacco Products” and “Modified Risk Tobacco Products” ("MRTP") exists under the jurisdiction of the FDA. FDA actions may influence the regulatory approach of other governments and international regulatory agencies.
FDA Review of IQOS
: We submitted to the FDA a Modified Risk Tobacco Product Application (“MRTPA”) for
IQOS
in December 2016, and a Premarket Tobacco Product Application (“PMTA”) for
IQOS
in March 2017.
On April 30, 2019, the FDA determined that a version of
IQOS
, namely,
IQOS
2.4 and three related consumables, is appropriate for the protection of public health and authorized it for sale in the United States. The FDA’s decision followed its comprehensive assessment of our PMTA. On December 7, 2020, the FDA reached the same determination for the
IQOS
3 device and authorized that version of
IQOS
for sale in the United States.
On July 7, 2020, the FDA determined that the available scientific evidence demonstrates that the issuance of an exposure modification order would be appropriate for the promotion of public health and authorized the marketing of a version of
IQOS
, namely
IQOS
2.4 and three related consumables, as an MRTP with reduced exposure claims. On March 11, 2022, the FDA reached the same determination for the
IQOS
3 device. The FDA authorized the marketing of this product in the U.S. with the following information:
"AVAILABLE EVIDENCE TO DATE:
•
the
IQOS
system heats tobacco but does not burn it.
•
this significantly reduces the production of harmful and potentially harmful chemicals.
•
scientific studies have shown that switching completely from conventional cigarettes to the
IQOS
system significantly reduces your body’s exposure to harmful or potentially harmful chemicals."
The FDA may issue two types of MRTP orders: a risk modification order or an exposure modification order. We had requested both types of orders for
IQOS
2.4 and an initial selection of three related consumables' variants. After review, the FDA determined that the evidence did not support issuing a risk modification order at that time, but that it did
