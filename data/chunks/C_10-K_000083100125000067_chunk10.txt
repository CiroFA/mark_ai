reflecting the continued maturation of multiple cards loan vintages originated in recent years, as well as macroeconomic pressures related to the elevated inflationary and interest rate environment impacting both cards portfolios, with lower FICO band customers primarily driving the increase.

(managed basis) net loss was $2.4 billion, compared to a net loss of $2.1 billion in the prior year, driven by lower revenues and lower income tax benefits, partially offset by lower expenses and lower cost of credit.
All Other
(managed basis) revenues decreased 20%, driven by lower revenues in Corporate/Other and Legacy Franchises. The decline in Corporate/Other was largely driven by net investment securities losses due to the repositioning of the investment securities portfolio and higher funding costs. Legacy Franchises (managed basis) revenues declined 6%, due to lower revenues in Asia Consumer (managed basis) and Legacy Holdings Assets, partially offset by higher revenues in Mexico Consumer/SBMM (managed basis).
All Other
(managed basis) expenses decreased 19%, primarily driven by the lower FDIC special assessment ($203 million in 2024 versus approximately $1.7 billion in the prior year) and a reduction from the closed exits and wind-downs, as well as the lower restructuring charges ($259 million in 2024 versus $781 million in 2023), partially offset by the civil money penalties imposed by the FRB and OCC in July 2024. Cost of credit was $1.1 billion, compared to $1.3 billion in the prior year, largely driven by a smaller ACL build for transfer risk associated with exposures outside the U.S., driven by safety and soundness considerations under U.S. banking law.

Macroeconomic and Other Risks and Uncertainties
Various macroeconomic, geopolitical and regulatory uncertainties and challenges pose risks to economic conditions in the U.S. and globally, including, among others, any resurgence in inflation; changes to trade, immigration, energy and other policies resulting from the new U.S. administration; changes in interest rate policies; the Russia–Ukraine war; conflicts in the Middle East; and economic conditions and tensions involving China.
For example, on February 1, 2025 the new U.S. administration announced the imposition of new tariffs on imports from China, Mexico and Canada, although the tariffs for Mexico and Canada were delayed for 30 days. China responded with tariffs against certain imports from the U.S. Additionally, on February 10, 2025, the U.S. administration announced global 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum imports.
