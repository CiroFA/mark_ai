final determination of our Board of Directors.
In June 2020, we issued $2 billion of senior unsecured notes, of which $1.5 billion is outstanding as of January 31, 2025, and is comprised of the following:
•
$500 million of 0.950% notes due July 2025;
•
$500 million of 1.350% notes due July 2027; and
•
$500 million of 1.650% notes due July 2030 (together, the 2020 Notes).
Interest is payable semiannually on January 15 and July 15 of each year. At January 31, 2025, our maximum commitment for interest payments was $65 million for the remaining duration of the outstanding 2020 Notes.
The 2020 Notes are senior unsecured obligations of Intuit and rank equally with all existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness of Intuit and are redeemable by us at any time, subject to a make-whole premium. Upon the occurrence of change of control transactions that are accompanied by certain downgrades in the credit ratings of the 2020 Notes, we will be required to repurchase the 2020 Notes at a repurchase price equal to 101% of the aggregate outstanding principal plus any accrued and unpaid interest to but not including the date of repurchase. The indenture governing the 2020 Notes requires us to comply with certain covenants. For example, the 2020 Notes limit our ability to create certain liens and enter into sale and leaseback transactions. As of January 31, 2025, we were compliant with all covenants governing the 2020 Notes. See Note 6 to the condensed consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report for more information.
