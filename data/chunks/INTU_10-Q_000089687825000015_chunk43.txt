On November 1, 2024, another subsidiary of Intuit entered into a secured revolving credit facility with a lender to fund the lending products and services we offer to qualified small businesses (the 2024 Secured Facility). The 2024 Secured Facility is secured by cash and receivables of the subsidiary and is non-recourse to Intuit Inc. Under the 2024 Secured Facility, the facility limit is $300 million, of which $150 million is committed and $150 million is uncommitted. Advances accrue interest at SOFR plus 1.15%. Unused portions of the committed credit facility accrue a fee at a rate ranging from 0.2% to 0.4%, depending on the total unused committed balance. The commitment term is through November 1, 2027, and the final maturity date is November 1, 2028. The agreement includes certain affirmative and negative covenants, including financial covenants that require the subsidiary to maintain specified financial ratios. As of January 31, 2025, we were compliant with all covenants governing the 2024 Secured Facility. At January 31, 2025, $109 million was outstanding under the 2024 Secured Facility and the weighted-average interest rate was 5.61%, which includes the fee on the unused committed portion. The outstanding balance is secured by cash and receivables of the subsidiary totaling $244 million as of January 31, 2025.
Subsequent to January 31, 2025, the committed limit of the 2024 Secured Facility was increased to $300 million and the uncommitted limit was reduced to zero.
We monitor counterparty risk associated with the institutional lenders that are providing the 2019 Secured Facility, the 2022 Secured Facility, and the 2024 Secured Facility.
