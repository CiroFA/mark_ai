EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
We reported net sales of $159.5 billion in fiscal 2024. Net earnings were $14.8 billion, or $14.91 per diluted share. Fiscal 2024 consisted of 53 weeks compared to 52 weeks in fiscal 2023. The 53
rd
week in fiscal 2024 added approximately $2.5 billion of net sales and increased diluted earnings per share by approximately $0.30.
During fiscal 2024, we opened ten new stores in the U.S. and two new stores in Mexico, resulting in a total store count of 2,347 at FebruaryÂ 2, 2025. A total of 322 of our stores, or 13.7%, were located in Canada and Mexico. Total sales per retail square foot were $599.92 in fiscal 2024. Our inventory turnover ratio was 4.7 times at the end of fiscal 2024, compared to 4.3 times at the end of fiscal 2023. The increase in our inventory turnover ratio was primarily driven by lower average inventory levels within our Primary segment during fiscal 2024.
During fiscal 2024, we generated $19.8 billion of cash flow from operations, received approximately $10.0 billion of proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt, net of discounts, and received $316 million of proceeds from commercial paper borrowings, net of repayments. We utilized a combination of commercial paper borrowings and the issuance of long-term debt, together with cash on hand, to fund the acquisition of SRS, with cash purchase consideration totaling $17.7 billion. Specifically, in June 2024, leading up to the SRS acquisition on June 18, 2024, we raised commercial paper borrowings of over $15.0 billion to fund the transaction, of which approximately $10.0 billion was then immediately repaid with the proceeds from our issuance of long-term debt. We have subsequently repaid all of the commercial borrowings used to fund the acquisition and ended fiscal 2024 with $316 million of commercial paper borrowings outstanding.
During fiscal 2024, we also paid $8.9 billion in cash dividends, funded $3.5 billion in capital expenditures, repaid $1.5 billion of long-term debt, and funded $649 million of share repurchases, prior to pausing share repurchases in March 2024.
In February 2025, we announced a 2.2% increase in our quarterly cash dividend to $2.30 per share.
Our ROIC was 31.3% for fiscal 2024 and 36.7% for fiscal 2023. The decrease in ROIC was primarily driven by higher average long-term debt and higher average equity due to the financing of the SRS acquisition. See the
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
section below for our definition and calculation of ROIC.
SRS Acquisition
On March 27, 2024, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire SRS, a leading residential specialty trade distribution company across several verticals serving the professional roofer, landscaper and pool contractor. On June 18, 2024, following the satisfaction or waiver of the applicable closing conditions, including receipt of the requisite regulatory approvals, the acquisition was completed and all
