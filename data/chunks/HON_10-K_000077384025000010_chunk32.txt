penalties, and compliance with any new regulations or policies may be burdensome and/or require significant expenditures.
Increased focus and evolving views of lawmakers on climate change and other ESG issues could have a long-term impact on our business and result of operations.
Increased public awareness and concern regarding global climate change and other ESG matters may result in more international, regional, and/or federal regulatory or other stakeholder requirements or expectations that could mandate more restrictive or expansive standards, such as stricter limits on GHG emissions or more prescriptive reporting of ESG metrics, practices, and targets, than the voluntary commitments that the Company has adopted or require such changes on a more accelerated time frame. There continues to be a lack of consistent climate and other ESG legislation, which creates economic and regulatory uncertainty; however, there has been an increasing amount of legislative and regulatory activity, particularly in the European Union, United Kingdom, and U.S., although we are unable to predict at this time how the trajectory of legislative and regulatory activity in the U.S. will be impacted by the new administration. In addition, there is also an increasing number of state-level anti-ESG initiatives in the U.S. that may conflict with other regulatory requirements, resulting in regulatory uncertainty. New or revised legal and regulatory requirements could impose significant operational restrictions and compliance requirements upon the Company or its products, and could negatively impact the Companyâ€™s business, capital expenditures, results of operations, financial condition, and competitive position.
