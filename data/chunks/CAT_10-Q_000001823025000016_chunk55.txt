LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
Sources of funds
We generate significant capital resources from operating activities, which are the primary source of funding for our ME&T operations. Funding for these businesses is also available from commercial paper and long-term debt issuances. Financial Products’ operations are funded primarily from commercial paper, term debt issuances and collections from its existing portfolio. On a consolidated basis, we had positive operating cash flow in the first three months of 2025 and ended the first quarter with $3.562 billion of cash, a decrease of $3.327 billion from year-end 2024. In addition, ME&T invests in available-for-sale debt securities and bank time deposits that are considered highly liquid and are available for current operations. These ME&T securities were $1.215 billion as of March 31, 2025 and are included in Prepaid expenses and other current assets and Other assets in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position.  We intend to maintain a strong cash and liquidity position.
Consolidated operating cash flow for the first three months of 2025 was $1.289 billion, down $763 million compared to the same period a year ago. The decrease was primarily due to lower profit before taxes adjusted for non-cash items.
Total debt as of March 31, 2025 was $38.588 billion, an increase of $179 million from year-end 2024. Debt related to ME&T increased $63 million in the first three months of 2025, while debt related to Financial Products increased $142 million.
As of March 31, 2025, we had three global credit facilities with a syndicate of banks totaling $10.500 billion (Credit Facility) available in the aggregate to both Caterpillar and Cat Financial for general liquidity purposes. Based on management’s allocation decision, which can be revised from time to time, the portion of the Credit Facility available to ME&T as of March 31, 2025 was $2.750 billion. Information on our Credit Facility is as follows:
•
The 364-day facility of $3.150 billion (of which $825 million is available to ME&T) expires in August 2025.
•
The three-year facility, as amended in August 2024, of $2.730 billion (of which $715 million is available to ME&T) expires in August 2027.
