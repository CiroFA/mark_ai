NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
During 2022, the company settled an IRS audit relating to the 2017 and 2018 tax years. The company recorded a $
208
million net tax benefit primarily from this settlement and related impacts, which resulted in a decrease in the company’s unrecognized tax benefits of $
658
million. The company recorded $
49
million of charges for expired tax credits and other related components of the settlement. The company recorded a charge of $
395
million to establish a valuation allowance against certain U.S. foreign tax credits which the company believes will more likely than not expire unutilized. The company also recorded $
101
million of additional net unrecognized tax benefit liabilities related to other tax audits.
The company generally receives a tax deduction upon the exercise of non-qualified stock options by employees, or the vesting of restricted stock units held by employees, for the difference between the exercise price and the market price of the underlying common stock on the date of exercise. The company uses the incremental tax benefit approach for utilization of tax attributes. These excess tax benefits reduce the tax provision. In 2024, 2023 and 2022, the company's tax provision was reduced by $
67
million, $
69
million and $
80
million, respectively, of such benefits.

The company estimates the degree to which tax assets, losses and credit carryforwards will result in a benefit based on expected profitability by tax jurisdiction and provides a valuation allowance for tax assets and loss and credit carryforwards that it believes will more likely than not expire unutilized. At December 31, 2024, all of the company’s valuation allowance relates to deferred tax assets, primarily net operating losses and disallowed interest expense carryforward, for which any subsequently recognized tax benefits will reduce income tax expense.
The changes in the valuation allowance are as follows:
At December 31, 2024, the company had net federal, state and non-U.S. net operating loss carryforwards of $
109
million, $
63
million and $
1.54
billion, respectively. Use of the carryforwards is limited based on the future income of certain subsidiaries. Of the federal net operating loss carryforwards, $
43
million expire in the years 2025 through 2037, and the remainder do not expire. Of the state net operating loss carryforwards, $
54
million expire in the years 2025 through 2043, and the remainder do not expire. Of the net non-U.S. net operating loss carryforwards, $
574
million expire in the years 2027 through 2044, and the remainder do not expire.
At December 31, 2024, the company had foreign tax credit carryforwards of $
