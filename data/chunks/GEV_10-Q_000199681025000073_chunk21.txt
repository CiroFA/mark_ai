assess the performance of each business in a given period. In connection with that assessment, the CEO may exclude certain non-cash
charges, such as depreciation and amortization, impairments and other matters, major restructuring programs, and certain gains and
losses from purchases and sales of business interests. Certain corporate costs, including those related to shared services, employee
benefits and information technology (
