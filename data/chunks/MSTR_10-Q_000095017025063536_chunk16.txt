As of March 31, 2025
, the Company had a valuation allowance of $
0.5
million primarily related to the Company’s deferred tax assets related to foreign tax credits in certain jurisdictions that, in the Company’s present estimation, more likely than not will not be realized. As of
March 31, 2025
, the Company had deferred tax liabilities with respect to the unrealized gain on its bitcoin holdings of approximately $
2.28
billion.
The Company’s
deferred tax liabilities are partially offset by deferred tax assets, such as net operating losses and capitalized research and development costs. If the market value of bitcoin declines in future periods, the Company’s
deferred tax liability with respect to the unrealized gain on its bitcoin holdings will decrease, and the Company
may be required to establish additional valuation allowances against its deferred tax assets
. The Company will continue to regularly assess the realizability of deferred tax assets.
