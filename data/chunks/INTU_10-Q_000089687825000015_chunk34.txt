updates to our Desktop subscription billing model.
Desktop Ecosystem revenue decreased $49 million, or 4%, in the first six months of fiscal 2025 compared with the same period of fiscal 2024. The decrease reflects changes we made to our QuickBooks desktop offering beginning in early fiscal 2024 to complete the transition to a recurring subscription model, which more closely aligns our Desktop license and related product updates to our Desktop subscription billing model, partially offset by higher effective prices.
Global Business Solutions segment operating income increased $376 million, or 22%, in the second quarter of fiscal 2025 compared with the same period of fiscal 2024, due to the increase in revenue described above, partially offset by increases in staffing expenses of $10 million and sales-related expenses of $3 million.
Global Business Solutions segment operating income increased $551 million, or 16%, in the first six months of fiscal 2025 compared with the same period of fiscal 2024, due to the increase in revenue described above, partially offset by increases in staffing expenses of $19 million and marketing expenses of $16 million.
In August 2024, we reorganized certain technology and customer success functions that support and benefit our overall platform and are managed at that level rather than at the segment level. As a result, these costs are no longer included in segment operating income and are now included in other corporate expenses. For the three and six months ended January 31, 2024, we reclassified $350 million and $682 million, respectively, from
Global Business Solutions
to other corporate expenses to conform to the current presentation.
