assumptions to be reasonable under the circumstances, and although our current estimates contemplate current and expected future
conditions, as applicable, it is reasonably possible that actual conditions could differ from our expectations, which could materially affect our
results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.
Estimates are used for, but are not limited to, determining revenues from contracts with customers, recoverability of inventory, long-lived
assets and investments, valuation of goodwill and intangible assets, useful lives used in depreciation and amortization, income taxes and
related valuation allowances, accruals for contingencies including legal, indemnifications, product warranties, and environmental, actuarial
assumptions used to determine costs of pension and postretirement benefits, valuation and recoverability of receivables, valuation of
derivatives, and valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as a result of acquisitions.
