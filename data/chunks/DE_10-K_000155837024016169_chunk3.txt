Financial Services Operations
​
​
Average wholesale receivables increased 26 percent driven by higher dealer used inventory levels. While new retail note volumes moderated due to reduced retail demand, average retail portfolio levels grew due to higher volumes in recent years resulting in a 9 percent increase. Revenue also increased due to higher average financing rates. Excluding the impact of a one-time correction of the accounting treatment for financing incentives offered to John Deere dealers in 2023 (see Note 4), net income declined as a result of a higher provision for credit losses and less-favorable financing spreads driven primarily by the receivable portfolio mix. These factors were partially offset by income earned on higher average portfolio balances.

We have access to global markets at a reasonable cost. Sources of liquidity include:
We closely monitor our cash requirements. Based on the available sources of liquidity, we expect to meet our funding needs in the short term (next 12 months) and long term (beyond 12 months). We are forecasting lower operating cash flows from equipment operations in 2025 compared with 2024 driven by a decrease in net income adjusted for non-cash provisions, partially offset by higher cash flows generated from inventory reductions.
We operate in multiple industries, which have unique funding requirements. The equipment operations are capital intensive. Historically, these operations have been subject to seasonal variations in financing requirements for inventories and receivables from dealers. The financial services operations rely on their ability to raise substantial amounts of funds to finance their receivable and lease portfolios.
The assets and liabilities of Banco John Deere S.A. (BJD) were reclassified to held for sale in the third quarter of 2024 and are therefore not included within the 2024 balances reflected below (see Note 4).
