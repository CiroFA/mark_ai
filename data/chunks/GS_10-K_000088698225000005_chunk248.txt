THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
Other Secured Financings
In addition to repurchase agreements and securities loaned transactions, the firm funds certain assets through the use of other secured financings and pledges financial instruments and other assets as collateral in these transactions. These other secured financings include:
•
Liabilities of CIEs and consolidated VIEs;
•
Transfers of assets accounted for as financings rather than sales (e.g., pledged commodities, bank loans and mortgage whole loans); and
•
Other structured financing arrangements.
Other secured financings included nonrecourse arrangements. Nonrecourse other secured financings were $
3.74
billion as of December 2024 and $
5.57
billion as of December 2023.
The firm has elected to apply the fair value option to substantially all other secured financings because the use of fair value eliminates non-economic volatility in earnings that would arise from using different measurement attributes. See Note 5 for further information about other secured financings that are accounted for at fair value.
Other secured financings that are not recorded at fair value are recorded based on the amount of cash received plus accrued interest, which generally approximates fair value. As these financings are not accounted for at fair value, they are not included in the firm’s fair value hierarchy in Notes 4 and 5. Had these financings been included in the firm’s fair value hierarchy, substantially all would have been classified in level 3 as of both December 2024 and December 2023.
