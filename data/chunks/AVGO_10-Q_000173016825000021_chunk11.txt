Net Income Per Share
Basic net income per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock and potentially dilutive shares of common stock outstanding during the period.

Potentially dilutive shares outstanding include the dilutive effect of unvested restricted stock units (“RSUs”) and employee stock purchase plan (“ESPP”) rights (collectively referred to as “equity awards”). Potentially dilutive shares whose effect would have been antidilutive are excluded from the computation of diluted net income per share.
The dilutive effect of equity awards is calculated based on the average stock price for each fiscal period, using the treasury stock method. Under the treasury stock method, the amount the employee must pay for purchasing shares under the ESPP and the amount of stock-based compensation expense for future service that we have not yet recognized are collectively assumed to be used to repurchase shares.
The following is a reconciliation of the numerators and denominators of the basic and diluted net income per share computations for the periods presented:

Senior Notes
In January 2025, we issued senior unsecured notes for an aggregate principal amount of $
3,000
million. Using the net proceeds from the senior notes and commercial paper issued in January 2025, as well as cash on hand, we repaid the remaining $
5,595
million of our unsecured term A-3 facility and $
2,000
million of our unsecured term A-5 facility. As a result of these repayments, we wrote off unamortized discount and issuance costs of $
65
million, which were included in interest expense in the condensed consolidated statement of operations.
We may redeem or purchase, in whole or in part, any of our senior notes prior to their respective maturities, subject to a specified make-whole premium determined in accordance with the indentures governing the respective notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest. In the event of a change in
