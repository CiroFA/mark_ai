INCOME TAXES.
Our effective income tax rate was
12.6
% and
12.3
% for the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively. The tax rate for 2025 was reduced compared to the U.S. statutory rate of 21% primarily due to U.S. business tax credit benefits, realized foreign tax credits benefits on the reinsurance transaction (see Note 12), tax benefits on equity compensation, and tax effects of favorable audit resolutions. The tax rate for 2024 was reduced compared to the U.S. statutory rate of 21% primarily due to gains associated with our retained and sold ownership interests, which we expect to recover without tax, and U.S. business credits.
The OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) has proposed a global minimum tax of 15% of reported profits (Pillar 2) that has been agreed upon in principle by over 140 countries. Since the proposal, many countries incorporated Pillar 2 model rule concepts into their domestic laws. Although the model rules provide a framework for applying the minimum tax, countries may enact Pillar 2 slightly differently than the model rules and on different timelines and may adjust domestic tax incentives in response to Pillar 2. In addition, in January 2025, the United States issued an executive order announcing opposition to aspects of these rules. As countries continue to enact and refine the Pillar 2 rules, we will evaluate the impact on our financial position. In 2025, we expect to incur $
0.1
billion in connection with the incorporation of the Pillar 2 model rules.
The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is currently auditing our consolidated U.S. income tax returns for 2016-2020.
