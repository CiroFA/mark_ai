is rendered obsolete by the rapid pace of technological change, or if customers reduce, delay or cancel orders, we may incur excess or obsolete inventory charges.
We are exposed to various factors that impact the industries in which we operate.
The global semiconductor, display and related industries are characterized by factors that impact demand for and the profitability of our products and services and our operating results, including:
•
the nature, timing and degree of visibility of changes in demand for semiconductor chips and electronic devices, including those related to fluctuations in consumer buying patterns tied to general economic or geopolitical conditions, seasonality or the introduction of new products, and the effects of these changes on customers’ businesses and on demand for our products;

•
increasing capital requirements for building and operating new fabrication plants and customers’ ability to raise the necessary capital;
•
trade, regulatory, tax or government incentives impacting the timing of customers’ investment in new or expanded fabrication plants;
•
differences in growth rates among the semiconductor, display and related industries in which we operate;
•
the importance of establishing, improving and maintaining strong relationships with customers;
•
the cost and complexity for customers to move from product design to volume manufacturing, which may slow the adoption rate of new manufacturing technology;
•
the importance of reducing the total cost of manufacturing system ownership;
•
the importance to customers of system reliability and productivity and the effect on demand for fabrication systems as a result of their increasing productivity, device yield and reliability;
•
manufacturers’ ability to reconfigure and re-use fabrication systems which can reduce demand for new equipment;
•
the importance of developing products with sufficient differentiation to influence customers’ purchasing decisions;
•
requirements for shorter cycle times for the development, manufacture and installation of our equipment;
•
price and performance trends for semiconductor devices and displays, and the impact on demand for such products;
•
the importance of the availability of spare parts to maximize the time that customers’ systems are available for production;
•
government incentives for local suppliers and domestic semiconductor research and development, and increased investment in manufacturing capabilities;
•
the increasing role for and complexity of software in our products; and
•
the focus on reducing energy usage and improving the environmental impact and sustainability associated with manufacturing operations, and the availability of adequate and reliable sources of energy.
If we do not effectively address these factors, our business and results of operations may be materially and adversely impacted.
We are exposed to factors specific to the semiconductor industry.
