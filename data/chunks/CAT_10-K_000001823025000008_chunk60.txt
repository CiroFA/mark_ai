purchased and sold in the U.S. and internationally, including in countries with political and economic instability or uncertainty. Some countries have greater political and economic volatility and greater vulnerability to infrastructure and labor disruptions than others.  Our business could be negatively impacted by adverse fluctuations in freight costs, fuel costs (e.g., diesel, bunker, jet), limitations on shipping and receiving capacity, and other disruptions in the transportation and shipping infrastructure at important geographic points of exit and entry for our products. Operating in different regions and countries exposes us to numerous risks, including:
•
multiple and potentially conflicting laws, regulations and policies that are subject to change;
•
imposition of currency restrictions, restrictions on repatriation of earnings or other restraints;
•
imposition of new or additional tariffs or quotas;
•
withdrawal from or modification of trade agreements or the negotiation of new trade agreements;
•
imposition of new or additional trade and economic sanctions laws imposed by the U.S. or foreign governments;
•
war or acts of terrorism; and
•
political and economic instability or civil unrest that may severely disrupt economic activity in affected countries.
