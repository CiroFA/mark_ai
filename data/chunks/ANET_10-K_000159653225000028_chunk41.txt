for any period as indicators of future performance. Our results of operations in any given period have been and could continue to be influenced by a number of factors, many of which are outside of our control and may be difficult to predict, including:
19
•
general economic conditions, both domestically and in foreign markets, and disruptions in our business and the markets due to, among other things, recessionary risks and a global economic downturn, higher interest rates, monetary policy shifts, inflationary pressures, supply chain and labor shortages, the new U.S. presidential administration, the recent banking crisis, and geopolitical pressures;
•
our inability to fulfill our customers’ orders, the deferral, reduction or cancellation of orders or the delay in shipment of our products;
•
the reduction in future demand for our products by our customers or increased difficulty in adding new customers
due to the unavailability or unpredictable supply of inventory, supply chain delays, access to key commodities or technologies, manufacturing disruptions or other events that impact our manufacturers or their suppliers;
•
a reduction, or uncertainty in the timing, of orders from our large customers;
•
announcements by us or other competitors of new products or product enhancements, warranty returns, general economic conditions or other factors;
•
our ability to increase sales to existing customers and attract new customers, including large customers;
•
the budgeting, sales, implementation and refresh cycles, purcha
sing practices, technology roadmaps and priorities and buying patterns of customers, including large customers who generally receive lower pricing terms due to volume discounts and who may or may not make large bulk purchases in certain quarters or who may elect to re-assign allocations to multiple vendors based upon specific network roles or projects or who may be placing orders
based on longer planning horizons
to ensure supply;
•
changes in the growth rate of existing or new customers or the deterioration of the financial performance, condition or prospects of existing or new customers, including large customers and service providers, changes in end-customer, distributor or reseller requirements or market needs, and changes in growth rates of the networking market;
•
the inclusion of any acceptance provisions in our customer contracts and increased customer trials, and any delays in acceptance, or rejection, or any return, of those products;
•
the cost and potential outcomes of existing and future litigation;
•
increased expenses resulting from increases in component, production and logistics costs resulting from factors such as global inflationary pressures, shortages in supply for semiconductors, and China's controls on the use of certain products and on the export of metals used in semiconductor manufacturing, or the tariffs imposed by the U.S. on goods from other countries and tariffs imposed by other countries on U.S. goods,
