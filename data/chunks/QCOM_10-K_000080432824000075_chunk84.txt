These trends may or may not continue in the future. Further, the trends for QTL have been, and may in the future be, impacted by disputes and/or resolutions with licensees and/or governmental investigations or proceedings.

We recorded other expenses of $179 million in fiscal 2024 compared to $862 million in fiscal 2023, both of which primarily consisted of restructuring and restructuring-related charges.
•
Investment and other income, net increased by $613 million in fiscal 2024 compared to the prior year, primarily due to higher interest rates earned on higher balances of interest-bearing securities.

$104 million decrease driven by lower costs related to the development of wireless and integrated circuit technologies (including 5G and application processor technologies).
