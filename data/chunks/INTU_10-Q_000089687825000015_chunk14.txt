2020 Notes.
In June 2020, we issued four series of senior unsecured notes (together, the 2020 Notes) pursuant to a public debt offering. The proceeds from the issuance were $
1.98
billion, net of debt discount of $
2
million and debt issuance costs of $
15
million. As of January 31, 2025, $
1.5
billion of the 2020 Notes remained outstanding.
Interest is payable semiannually on January 15 and July 15 of each year. The discount and debt issuance costs are amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the term of the 2020 Notes. We paid $
10
million
in
interest on the 2020 Notes during each of the six months ended January 31, 2025 and 2024.
The 2020 Notes are senior unsecured obligations of Intuit and rank equally with all existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness of Intuit and are redeemable by us at any time, subject to a make-whole premium. Upon the occurrence of change of control transactions that are accompanied by certain downgrades in the credit ratings of the 2020 Notes, we will be required to repurchase the 2020 Notes at a repurchase price equal to
101
% of the aggregate outstanding principal plus any accrued and unpaid interest to but not including the date of repurchase. The indenture governing the 2020 Notes requires us to comply with certain covenants. For example, the 2020 Notes limit our ability to create certain liens and enter into sale and leaseback transactions. As of January 31, 2025, we were compliant with all covenants governing the 2020 Notes.
