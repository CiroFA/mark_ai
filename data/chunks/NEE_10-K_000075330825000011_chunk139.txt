Plan by permitting a third-party administrative recordkeeper to charge allegedly excessive fees for the services provided and allegedly by allowing a large volume of plan assets to be invested in NEE common stock. The plaintiff seeks declaratory, equitable and monetary relief on behalf of the Plan and Plan participants. NEE and the plaintiff have agreed to a specified stay of the action to permit the plaintiff to exhaust the administrative remedies available under the Plan.
In November 2024, NEE was named as defendant in an antitrust lawsuit (Avangrid, Inc. et al. v. NextEra Energy, Inc.) filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts. This lawsuit seeks damages of $
350
million, which are tripled in the event of a finding of monopolization under the Sherman Act, from the defendants for alleged violations of federal and state antitrust laws, as well as Massachusetts state laws. In January 2025, NEE filed a motion to dismiss and a motion to transfer venue. NEE does not believe that it should have any liability with respect to the claims in this matter.

Segment Information
Effective January 1, 2024, NEE and FPL adopted an accounting standards update that provides guidance on segment reporting and requires additional disclosures related to significant segment expenses and increases the frequency of segment reporting to interim periods (updated segment standard).
