machine learning for a period of time and has more recently begun using Generative AI, a type of artificial intelligence that uses generative models to create text and other content. Generative AI tools are available to employees within parts of the Company, and in the future Citi may more broadly use, develop and incorporate Generative AI within its technology platform and services, systems and its businesses and functions. While Citi has policies which govern the use of emerging technologies, ineffective, inadequate or faulty Generative AI development or deployment practices by Citi or third parties could result in unintended consequences, such as AI algorithms that produce inaccurate or incomplete output or output based on biased, incomplete and/or inaccurate datasets, or cause other issues, concerns or deficiencies. Moreover, the use of increasingly sophisticated AI technologies by malicious actors and others has increased the risk of fraud, including identity theft and bypassing of verification controls, and failure to effectively manage such risks could result in misappropriation of funds, unauthorized transactions, exposure of sensitive client or Company information, reputational harm and increased litigation and regulatory risk. In addition, compliance with new or changing laws, regulations or industry standards relating to AI may impose additional operational risks and costs.
Although Citi has continued to upgrade its technology, including systems to automate processes and gain efficiencies, operational incidents are unpredictable and can arise from numerous sources, not all of which are fully within Citi’s control. These include, among others, operational or execution failures or deficiencies by third parties and third parties that provide products or services to Citi (e.g., cloud service

providers), including such third parties’ downstream service providers, other market participants or those that otherwise have an ongoing partnership or business relationship with Citi; deficiencies in processes or controls; inadequate management of data governance practices, data controls and monitoring mechanisms that may adversely impact internal or external reporting and decision-making; cyber or information security incidents (see the cybersecurity risk factor below); human error, such as manual transaction processing errors (e.g., erroneous payments to lenders or manual errors by traders that cause system and market disruptions or losses), which can be exacerbated by staffing challenges and processing backlogs; fraud or malice on the part of employees or third parties; insufficient (or limited) straight-through processing between legacy or bespoke systems and any failure to design and effectively operate controls that mitigate operational risks associated with those legacy or bespoke systems, leading to potential risk of errors and operating losses; accidental system or technological failure; electrical or telecommunication outages; failures
