In addition, potential quality issues may be identified in the course of a clinical trial that cannot be remediated to the satisfaction of a regulatory authority that may take actions within the scope of its enforcement authority, including excluding data and placing restrictions on future clinical trials.
Additionally, our product candidates can fail at any stage of the R&D process, and may not receive regulatory approval even after many years of R&D. We may fail to correctly identify compounds or indications for which our science is promising or allocate R&D investment resources efficiently, and failure to invest in the right technology platforms, therapeutic areas, product classes, geographic markets and/or licensing opportunities could adversely impact the productivity of our pipeline.
