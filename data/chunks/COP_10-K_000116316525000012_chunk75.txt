Canada
*Average sales prices include unutilized transportation costs.
The Canada segment operations include the Surmont oil sands development in Alberta, the Montney unconventional play in British Columbia and commercial operations. In 2024, Canada contributed ten percent of our consolidated liquids production and five percent of our consolidated natural gas production.
Net Income (Loss)
Canada reported earnings of $712 million in 2024 compared with earnings of $402 million in 2023.
Earnings included higher revenues resulting from higher volumes of $676 million; driven by our increased working interest in Surmont of $584 million and new wells online in the Montney of $180 million, partially offset by planned turnaround activity at Surmont impacting revenues by $157 million. Additionally, revenues increased from higher overall commodity prices of $153 million, driven primarily by higher bitumen prices.

Decreases to earnings included higher production and operating expenses of $215 million; driven by an impact of $175 million related to higher overall production, including our increased working interest in Surmont; as well as expenses of $55 million related to turnaround activity at Surmont. Additional decreases to earnings included higher DD&A expenses of $166 million resulting from higher volumes and the absence of a $92 million tax benefit recognized upon the closing of a Canada Revenue Agency audit in 2023.
Production
Total average production increased 60 MBOED in 2024 compared with 2023. Increases to production resulted from our increased working interest in Surmont as well as new wells online in the Montney and Surmont.

These production increases were partly offset by higher downtime resulting from a planned turnaround activity at a Surmont central processing facility and normal field decline.

Net Income (Loss)
The Europe, Middle East and North Africa segment reported earnings of $1,189 million in 2024 compared with earnings of $1,189 million in 2023.
Earnings in 2024 included lower revenues resulting from lower overall commodity prices of $118 million and the timing of sales as compared with 2023, partly offset by higher volumes of $144
