Share repurchases, net of issuances, are subject to a nondeductible 1% excise tax which was recognized as a direct and incremental cost associated with these transactions. For repurchases of common stock, the tax is recorded as part of the cost basis of the treasury stock repurchased, resulting in no impact to the consolidated statement of income. For repurchases of preferred stock, the tax impact is included within preferred stock dividends and other on the consolidated statement of income.
