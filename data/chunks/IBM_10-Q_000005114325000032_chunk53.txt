Noncurrent liabilities (excluding debt) increased $481 million (decreased $34 million adjusted for currency) primarily driven by currency and an increase in deferred income, partially offset by a decrease in retirement and nonpension postretirement benefit obligations.

Non-Financing debt of $53,262 million increased $10,405 million ($9,868 million adjusted for currency) from December 31, 2024, primarily due to the first-quarter debt issuances to increase our financial liquidity and plan for our future debt maturities; partially offset by maturities within the quarter.
Financing segment debt of $10,022 million decreased $2,094 million ($2,197 million adjusted for currency) from December 31, 2024, primarily due to lower funding requirements associated with financing receivables.
Financing provides financing solutions predominantly for IBM’s external client assets, and the debt used to fund Financing assets is primarily comprised of intercompany loans. Total debt changes generally correspond with the level of client and commercial financing receivables, the level of cash and cash equivalents, the change in intercompany and external payables, and the change in intercompany investment from IBM. The terms of the intercompany loans are set by the company to substantially match the term, currency and interest rate variability underlying the financing receivable. The Financing debt-to-equity ratio remained at 9.0 to 1 at March 31, 2025.
