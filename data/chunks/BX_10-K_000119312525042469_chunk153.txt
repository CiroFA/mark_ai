Table of Contents
Year Ended December 31, 2024 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2023
Segment Distributable Earnings were $2.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2024, a decrease of $127.5 million, compared to $2.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023. The decrease in Segment Distributable Earnings was attributable to decreases of $113.3 million in Fee Related Earnings and $14.2 million in Net Realizations.
The performance of funds in our Real Estate segment in 2024 was negatively impacted by volatility in the
10-year
Treasury yield, including a sharp increase in the fourth quarter, and a strong U.S. dollar. However, we believe a commercial real estate recovery is underway. Although the pace of such recovery is uncertain, the underpinnings are firmly in place, including a healthy economic backdrop that supports cash flow growth, meaningful improvements in the cost and availability of capital and a material decrease in construction starts. Subject to inflation subsiding, this should set the stage for a multi-year recovery. The constraints on future new supply, including in certain sectors in which our global opportunistic and Core+ real estate portfolios are concentrated, such as logistics and rental housing, should also support real estate values over time.
We additionally continue to believe that, despite recent speculation about data center demand, there will continue to be significant demand for digital infrastructure as artificial intelligence and other technological innovation is increasingly adopted and developed. Our Real Estate segment is well positioned to benefit from this trend. In certain markets and sectors with elevated near-term supply, including U.S. logistics and multifamily, however, growth has slowed and may moderate further.
