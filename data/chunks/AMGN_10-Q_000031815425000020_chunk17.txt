pursued resolution with the IRS appeals office, but were unable to reach a resolution. In July 2022, we filed a petition in the U.S. Tax Court to contest a Notice for the years 2013–2015 that we previously reported receiving in April 2022 that seeks to increase our U.S. taxable income for the years 2013–2015 by an amount that would result in additional federal tax of approximately $
5.1
billion, plus interest. In addition, the Notice asserts penalties of approximately $
2.0
billion. Any additional tax that could be imposed for the years 2013–2015 would be reduced by up to approximately $
2.2
billion of repatriation tax previously accrued on our foreign earnings.
We firmly believe that the IRS positions set forth in the 2010–2012 and 2013–2015 Notices are without merit. We are contesting the 2010–2012 and 2013–2015 Notices through the judicial process. The
two
cases were consolidated in the U.S. Tax Court on December 19, 2022. The trial began on November 4, 2024 and concluded on January 17, 2025. With the conclusion of the trial, the parties will file post-trial briefs and make closing arguments in 2025. The Company expects a decision from the U.S. Tax Court no earlier than the second half of 2026.
We are currently under examination by the IRS for the years 2016–2018 with respect to issues similar to those for the 2010 through 2015 period. We believe that the IRS may also seek to continue to audit similar issues related to the allocation of income between the United States and the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico for years beyond 2018. In addition, we are under examination by a number of state and foreign tax jurisdictions.
Final resolution of these complex matters is not likely within the next 12 months. We continue to believe our accrual for income tax liabilities is appropriate based on past experience, interpretations of tax law, application of the tax law to our facts and judgments about potential actions by tax authorities; however, due to the complexity of the provision for income taxes and uncertain resolution of these matters, the ultimate outcome of any tax matters may result in payments substantially greater than amounts accrued and could have a material adverse impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements.

During the three months ended March 31, 2025, the gross amounts of our UTBs increased by $
40
million as a result of tax positions taken during the current year. Substantially all of the UTBs as of March 31, 2025, if recognized, would affect our effective tax rate.

Earnings per share
The computation of basic EPS is based on the weighted-average number of our common shares outstanding. The computation of diluted EPS is based on the weighted-average number of our common shares outstanding and dilutive potential common shares, which primarily include shares that may be issued under our stock option, restricted stock and performance unit award programs (collectively, dilutive securities), as determined by using the
