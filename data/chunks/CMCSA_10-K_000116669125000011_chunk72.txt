summarizes the capital expenditures we incurred in our segments in the Connectivity & Platforms business in 2024 and 2023.
Table of Contents
We expect our capital expenditures in 2025 will continue to be focused on investments in the Connectivity & Platforms business in scalable infrastructure as we increase capacity and continue to execute our plans to upgrade our network to deliver multigigabit symmetrical speeds, in line extensions for the expansion of homes and businesses passed, and in the continued deployment of wireless gateways. In addition, we expect to continue investment in existing and new attractions at our Universal theme parks, including Epic Universe. Capital expenditures for subsequent years will depend on numerous factors, including competition, changes in technology, regulatory changes, the timing and rate of deployment of new services, the capacity required for existing services, the timing of new attractions at our theme parks and potential acquisitions.
Financing Activities
Net cash used in financing activities decreased in 2024 primarily due to repayment of a collateralized obligation in the prior year (see Note 7), a decrease in repurchases of common stock under our share repurchase program and employee plans, lower repurchases and repayments of debt in the current year, repayments of short-term borrowings, net in the prior year and higher proceeds from borrowings in the current year.
In September 2024, we issued €1.8 billion aggregate principal amount of fixed-rate euro senior notes maturing in 2032 and 2036 and entered into a corresponding cross-currency swap, effectively converting the debt to an aggregate U.S. dollar principal amount of $2.0 billion with a weighted-average interest rate of 4.72%. We also issued £750 million ($1.0 billion using exchange rates on the date of issuance) principal amount of fixed rate sterling senior notes maturing in 2040 with an interest rate of 5.25%. The net proceeds from this issuance were intended for working capital and general corporate purposes, including the early redemption of $725 million of our outstanding 5.25% Notes due 2025, which was completed in October 2024, and the repayment of certain of our other outstanding debt with near-term maturities. In May 2024, we issued $3.3 billion aggregate principal amount of fixed-rate senior notes, which have maturities ranging between 2029 and 2054 and a weighted-average interest rate of 5.38%. The net proceeds from this issuance were used for the repayment of our outstanding commercial paper, and for working capital and general corporate purposes.
In 2024, we made debt repayments of $3.6 billion, including $1.9 billion principal amount of notes due at maturity and $750 million of 5.250% Notes due 2025, $391 million of 3.950% Notes due 2025, $256 million of 3.375% Notes due 2025, and $104 million of 3.150% Notes due 2026.
We have made, and may from time to time in the future make, optional repayments on our debt obligations, which may
