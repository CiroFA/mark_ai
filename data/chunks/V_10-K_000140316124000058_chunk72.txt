out of the previous MDL class settlement. To assess the estimated monetary exposure in the Company’s analysis, we compared such amounts to the complete population of amounts attributable to the remaining opt-out merchants. We performed a sensitivity analysis over the Company’s monetary exposure calculations, and we recalculated the amount of the ending litigation accrual. We read letters received directly from the Company’s external legal counsel and internal legal counsel that discussed the Company’s legal matters, including the
MDL – Individual Merchant Actions
. We also considered relevant publicly available information.
