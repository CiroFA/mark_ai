program. These stock options have an exercise price equal to
120.0
% of the fair market value of our stock on the date of grant. The stock options are scheduled to vest and become exercisable
three years
after the grant date and expire
ten years
after the grant date. If an executive terminates employment because of retirement, layoff, disability, or death, the executive (or beneficiary) may receive some or all of their stock options depending on certain age and service conditions. The fair value of the stock options granted was $
79.53
per unit and was estimated using a Monte-Carlo simulation model using the following assumptions: expected life
7.0
years, expected volatility
39.0
%, risk free interest rate
4.5
% and
no
expected dividend yield.
Restricted Stock Units
On February 19, 2025, we granted
2,244,444
restricted stock units (RSU) to our executives as part of our long-term incentive program. The RSUs granted under this program have a grant date fair value of $
184.53
per unit and will generally vest in three approximately equal installments on the first, second, and third anniversaries of the grant date. These RSUs will settle in common stock (on a one-for-one basis). If an executive terminates employment because of retirement, layoff, disability, or death, the executive (or beneficiary) may receive some or all of their stock units depending on certain age and service conditions. In all other cases, the RSUs will not vest and all rights to the stock units will terminate.
