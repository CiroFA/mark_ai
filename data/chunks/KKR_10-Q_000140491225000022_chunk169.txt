factors that may impact our business, financial performance, operating results and valuations.
Uncalled Commitments
Private Equity
As of March 31, 2025, our Private Equity business line had $60.2 billion of remaining uncalled commitments that could be called for investments in new transactions as compared to $54.9 billion as of December 31, 2024. The increase was primarily attributable to new capital commitments from fund investors, which was partially offset by capital called from fund investors to make investments during the period.
Real Assets
As of March 31, 2025, our Real Assets business line had $31.4 billion of remaining uncalled commitments that could be called for investments in new transactions as compared to $33.3 billion as of December 31, 2024. The decrease was primarily attributable to capital called from fund investors to make investments during the period, which was partially offset by new capital commitments from fund investors.
Credit and Liquid Strategies
As of March 31, 2025, our Credit and Liquid Strategies business line had $24.0 billion of remaining uncalled commitments that could be called for investments in new transactions as compared to $21.4 billion as of December 31, 2024. The increase was primarily attributed to new capital commitments from fund investors, which was partially offset by capital called from fund investors to make investments during the period.
Capital Invested
Private Equity
For the three months ended March 31, 2025, our Private Equity business line had $4.3 billion of capital invested as compared to $1.2 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2024. The increase was driven primarily by a $1.6 billion increase in capital invested in our traditional private equity strategy and a $1.3 billion increase in capital invested in our core private equity strategy. During the three months ended March 31, 2025, 69% of capital deployed in private equity (including core and growth equity investments which includes impact investments) was in transactions in North America, 17% was in the Asia-Pacific region, and 14% was in Europe. The number of large private equity investments made in any quarterly or year-to-date period is volatile and, consequently, a significant amount of capital invested in one period or a few periods may not be indicative of a similar level of capital deployment in future periods.
Real Assets
For the three months ended March 31, 2025, our Real Assets business line had $5.6 billion of capital invested as compared to $5.5 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2024. The increase was driven primarily by a $0.9 billion increase in capital invested in our energy strategy and a $0.4 billion increase in our infrastructure strategy, which was largely offset by a $1.2 billion decrease in capital invested in our real estate strategy. During the three months ended March 31, 2025, 39% of capital deployed in real assets was in transactions in Europe, 37% was in North America, and 24% was in the
