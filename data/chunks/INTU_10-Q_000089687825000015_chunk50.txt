relating to the use of new and evolving technologies such as AI in our offerings, may result in reputational harm and liability, and may cause us to incur additional research and development costs to resolve such issues. Our brand value also depends on our ability to provide secure and trustworthy products and services, as well as our ability to protect and use our customers’ data in a manner that meets their expectations. In addition, a security incident that results in unauthorized disclosure of our customers’ sensitive data could cause material reputational harm. Damage to our reputation and loss of brand equity may reduce demand for our products or services and thus have an adverse effect on our future financial results, as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation and restore the value of the brands and could also reduce our stock price.
Our efforts related to environment, social, and governance matters expose us to risks that could adversely affect our reputation and performance.
Our environmental, social and governance efforts are subject to numerous risks that may be outside of our control, including our ability to recruit, develop and retain the talent we need, evolving regulatory requirements, and the ability of our suppliers to meet our requirements and standards. In addition, standards for tracking and reporting these matters continue to evolve and we may not be able to implement new and changing standards in ways that meet the expectations of all of our stakeholders. Our failure or perceived failure to meet evolving stakeholder expectations could harm our reputation, adversely impact our ability to attract and retain employees or customers, and expose us to increased scrutiny from the investment community and enforcement authorities. Our reputation also may be harmed by negative perceptions that our customers, employees and other stakeholders may have about our action or inaction on social, ethical, or political issues.
Our acquisition and divestiture activities may disrupt our ongoing business, may involve increased expenses and may present risks not contemplated at the time of the transactions.
We have acquired and may continue to acquire companies, products, technologies and talent that complement our strategic direction, both in and outside the United States. Acquisitions involve significant risks and uncertainties, including:
•
inability to successfully integrate the acquired technology, data assets and operations into our business and maintain uniform standards, controls, policies, and procedures;
•
inability to realize synergies or anticipated benefits within the expected time frame or at all;
•
disruption of our ongoing business and distraction of management;
•
challenges retaining the key employees, customers, resellers and other business partners of the acquired operation;
•
the internal control environment of an acquired entity may not be consistent with our standards or with regulatory requirements,
