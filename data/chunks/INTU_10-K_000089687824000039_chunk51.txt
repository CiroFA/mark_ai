retain large amounts of sensitive and personal data across an array of our own and third-party information systems. To help protect these systems and data, we have implemented a robust information security program that includes numerous administrative, technical, and physical safeguards. We strive to evolve our cyber defenses to help minimize impacts from cyber threats. In general, we seek to address cybersecurity risks through a cross-functional approach. This approach focuses on protecting business operations and preserving the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of systems and data by preventing and mitigating cybersecurity threats, as well as effectively responding to cybersecurity incidents when they occur.
Our information security program includes:
•
Having designated information security personnel, led by our Chief Information Security and Fraud Prevention Officer (CISO), who has decades of relevant experience and has previously served as Chief Information Officer. The CISO is supported primarily by our Cybersecurity, Compliance, Risk, and Fraud Team (CyberCRAFT), which consists of approximately 490 professionals as of July 31, 2024. In addition to bringing their current expertise to their roles, CyberCRAFT professionals have the ability to participate in our specialized training and development programs to further enhance their cybersecurity skillsets and cross-train on related capabilities. The CISO works closely with the Company’s internal legal team to oversee compliance with legal, regulatory and contractual security requirements;
•
Risk assessments designed to help identify and prioritize significant cybersecurity risks. Our process for identifying and assessing material risks from cybersecurity threats includes incorporation of an internally developed threat catalog and our tracking of trends for areas such as vulnerability management, our leverage of technical standards and guidance, input from our participation and collaboration with law enforcement and government initiatives, and our internal and vendor-supported threat intelligence initiatives. The cybersecurity risk assessment operates alongside our broader overall enterprise-wide risk assessment and management process, and key cybersecurity risks are presented to the Audit and Risk Committee in a manner that helps frame cybersecurity risks as part of a broader risk context;
