Chevron’s strategy, aspirations, targets and disclosures related to environmental, social, and governance matters.
2050 Net Zero Upstream Aspiration
Chevron aspires to achieve net zero for upstream production Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions on an equity basis by 2050.
The company believes accomplishing this aspiration depends on, among other things, sufficient and substantial advances in technology, including the continuing progress of commercially viable technologies and low- or non-carbon-based energy sources; enabling policies and other actions by governing authorities, including those regarding subsidies, tax and other incentives as well as the granting of necessary permits; successful negotiations for carbon capture and storage and nature-based solutions with customers, suppliers, partners and governments; market conditions; and the availability and acceptability of cost-effective, verifiable carbon credits.
2028 Upstream Production GHG Intensity Targets
These metrics include Scope 1 (direct emissions) and Scope 2 (indirect emissions associated with imported electricity and steam) and are net of emissions from exported electricity and steam. The 2028 GHG emissions intensity targets on an equity ownership basis include:
•
Oil production GHG intensity of 24 kilograms (kg) carbon dioxide equivalent per barrel of oil-equivalent (CO
2
e/boe),
•
Gas production GHG intensity of 24 kg CO
2
e/boe,
•
Methane intensity of 2 kg CO
2
e/boe, and
•
Flaring GHG intensity of 3 kg CO
2
e/boe.
The company also targets zero routine flaring by 2030 as outlined in the World Bank’s “Zero Routine Flaring by 2030” initiative.
2028 Portfolio Carbon Intensity Target
The company also introduced a portfolio carbon intensity (PCI) metric, which is a measure of the carbon intensity across the full value chain of Chevron’s entire business. This metric encompasses the company’s upstream and downstream business and includes Scope 1 (direct emissions), Scope 2 (indirect emissions from imported electricity and steam), and certain Scope 3 (primarily emissions from use of sold products) emissions. The company’s PCI target is 71 grams (g) carbon dioxide equivalent (CO
2
e) per megajoule (MJ) by 2028.
Planned Lower-Carbon Capital Spend through 2028
In 2021, the company guided to capital spend of approximately $10 billion through 2028 to advance its lower carbon ambitions, which includes approximately $2 billion to lower the carbon intensity of its oil and gas operations, and approximately $8 billion for lower carbon investments including in renewable fuels, hydrogen and carbon capture and offsets. Beyond 2028, the company anticipates capital spending will be necessary to progress the company’s 2050 upstream production Scope 1 and 2 net zero aspiration and building of its lower carbon business lines.
Since 2021, the company has spent $7.7 billion in lower carbon investments, including $2.9 billion associated with the acquisition of REG in 2022.
