Acquisitions and Divestitures
Acquisition of remaining ownership in Sabra
On December 3, 2024, we acquired the Strauss Group’s
50
% ownership in Sabra for total consideration of $
241
million in cash, resulting in Sabra becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary. Upon consolidation, we recognized a pre-tax gain of $
122
million ($
92
million after-tax or $
0.07
per share) in our FLNA division, recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses, related to the remeasurement of our previously held
50
% equity ownership in Sabra at fair value using a combination of the transaction price, net of a control premium, and discounted cash flows.
We accounted for the acquisition as a business combination in the fourth quarter of 2024. We recognized and measured the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their estimated fair values on the date of acquisition, in our FLNA division. The preliminary estimates of the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in this transaction as of the acquisition date primarily include goodwill and other intangible assets of $
0.3
billion and property, plant and equipment of $
0.1
billion. The preliminary estimates of the fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed are subject to revision, which may result in adjustments to the preliminary values discussed above as valuations are finalized. We expect to finalize these amounts as soon as possible, but no later than the fourth quarter of 2025.
Acquisition of Siete
On January 17, 2025, we acquired all of the outstanding equity interest in Siete, a Mexican-American foods business, in a transaction valued at approximately $
1.2
