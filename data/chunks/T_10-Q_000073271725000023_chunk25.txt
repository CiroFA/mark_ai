depreciation impacts from our Open RAN network modernization efforts.
Operating income
decreased in the first quarter of 2025. Our operating income margin in the first quarter decreased from 19.5% in 2024 to 18.8% in 2025.
Interest expense
decreased in the first quarter of 2025, primarily due to lower debt balances, partially offset by lower capitalized interest associated with spectrum acquisitions.
Equity in net income of affiliates
increased in the first quarter of 2025. The increase reflects cash distributions received by AT&T in excess of the carrying amount of our investment in DIRECTV (see Note 9).
Other income (expense) – net
increased in the first quarter of 2025. The increase was primarily due to first-quarter 2024 noncash impairment charges for a held-for-sale business and our SKY Mexico equity investment. Partially offsetting the increase were lower pension and postretirement benefit credits and lower returns on other benefit-related investments.

Income tax expense
increased in the first quarter of 2025. The increase was primarily due to higher income before income
tax. Our effective tax rate was 21.7% in the first quarter of 2025, versus 23.0% in the comparable period in the prior year,

eflecting larger discrete state tax benefits in 2025.
Segment Results
Our segments are comprised of strategic business units or other operations that offer products and services to different customer segments over various technology platforms and/or in different geographies that are managed accordingly. We evaluate segment performance based on operating income as well as EBITDA and/or EBITDA margin. See “Discussion and Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures” for a reconciliation of EBITDA and EBITDA margin to the most comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
Operating revenues
increased in the first quarter of 2025, primarily driven by increases in our Mobility and Consumer Wireline business units, partially offset by declines in our Business Wireline business unit, which reflects lower demand for legacy services and product simplification, as well as the absence of revenues from our cybersecurity business that was contributed to a new cybersecurity joint venture, LevelBlue, in the second quarter of 2024.
Operating income
increased in the first quarter of 2025. Our Communications segment operating income margin in the first quarter increased from 23.4% in 2024 to 23.7% in 2025. Our Communications EBITDA margin in the first quarter increased from 39.8% in 2024 to 40.5% in 2025.
