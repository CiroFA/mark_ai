In June 2024, we signed an agreement to exit our Canadian life and health insurance portfolio, which had reserves of $
213
million at December 31, 2024, via an assumption reinsurance transaction. We received regulatory approval in December 2024 and expect the transaction to close in the first quarter of 2025.
See Notes 1, 3 and 9 for further information related to our run-off insurance operations.
NOTE 13.
POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS
PENSION BENEFITS AND RETIREE HEALTH AND LIFE BENEFITS.
We sponsor a number of pension and retiree health and life insurance benefit plans that we present in
three
categories, principal pension plans, other pension plans and principal retiree benefit plans. Smaller pension plans with pension assets or obligations that have not reached $
50
million and other retiree benefit plans are not presented.
Effective January 1, 2023, certain postretirement benefit plans and liabilities were legally split or allocated between GE HealthCare, GE Vernova and GE Aerospace. In connection with the separations, net liabilities associated with GE's postretirement benefit plans, including a portion of the principal pension plans, other pension plans and the principal retiree benefit plans, were transferred to GE HealthCare and GE Vernova and are now reported in discontinued operations. See Note 2 for more information regarding the separations. The amounts that remain with GE Aerospace following the separations are shown as continuing operations in the aggregate rather than for each remaining split plan. Assumptions used in calculations, estimates of future benefit payments and funding, and other forward looking statements are for continuing operations unless otherwise noted.

(a) Plans for GE Aerospace that reach $
50
million are not removed from the presentation unless part of a disposition or plan termination.
Due to the spin-off of Vernova on April 2, 2024, as discussed in Note 1, we have excluded 2023 GE Vernova benefit obligations of $
18,258
, assets of $
16,342
, and a deficit of $
1,916
from the above funding status by plan type chart.
FUNDING.
The Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) determines minimum funding requirements in the U.S. No contributions were required or made for the GE Aerospace Pension Plan during 2024 and based on our current assumptions, we do not anticipate having to make additional required contributions in the near future. On an ERISA basis, our estimate for 2024 is that the GE Aerospace Pension Plan was
85
% funded and the U.S. GAAP funded status is
91
%.

In 2025, we expect to make payments of approximately $
210
million for our GE Aerospace Supplementary Pension Plan benefits and remaining principal pension plans administrative costs. We also expect to contribute approximately $
40
million to other pension plans in 2025. We fund retiree benefit plans on a pay-as-you-go basis and the retiree benefit insurance trust at our
