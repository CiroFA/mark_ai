of stock options are estimated using historical forfeiture data dating back to 1990.
Fair Value and Assumptions
The fair market values of stock options and stock appreciation rights granted in 2024, 2023 and 2022 were measured on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions:
1
Expected term is based on historical exercise and post-vesting cancellation data.
2
Volatility rate is based on historical stock prices over an appropriate period, generally equal to the expected term.
A summary of option activity during 2024 is presented below:
The total intrinsic value (i.e., the difference between the exercise price and the market price) of options exercised during 2024, 2023 and 2022 was $
190
, $
167
and $
2,369
, respectively. During this period, the company continued its practice of issuing treasury shares upon exercise of these awards.
As of December 31, 2024, there was $
320
of total unrecognized before-tax compensation cost related to nonvested share-based compensation arrangements granted under the plan. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of
1.9
years.
