commissions, net of operating expenses) are included as a reduction of underwriting expenses.
2023 versus 2022
GEICO’s pre-tax underwriting earnings increase in 2023 reflected higher average premiums per auto policy, lower claims frequencies, more favorable development of prior accident years’ claims estimates and lower advertising costs. However, average claims severities increased in 2023 due to higher auto repair parts prices, labor costs and medical inflation. GEICO sought rate increases in numerous states in 2022 and 2023 in response to accelerating claims costs.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis
Insurance—Underwriting
GEICO
Premiums written increased $730 million (1.9%) in 2023 compared to 2022, reflecting higher average premiums per auto policy (16.8%) due to rate increases, partially offset by a 9.8% decrease in policies-in-force. Premiums earned increased $280 million (0.7%) in 2023 compared to 2022. Reductions in advertising expenditures in 2022 and 2023 contributed to reductions of policies-in-force.
Losses and loss adjustment expenses decreased $4.5 billion (12.4%) in 2023. GEICO’s loss ratio declined 12.1 percentage points compared to 2022, reflecting the impact of higher average premiums per auto policy, lower property damage and collision claims frequencies and increased favorable development of prior accident years’ claims estimates, partially offset by increases in average claims severities across all significant coverages. Average claim severities increased for property damage (fourteen to sixteen percent range), collision (four to six percent range) and bodily injury (five to seven percent range). Losses and loss adjustment expenses included reductions in the ultimate loss estimates for prior accident years’ claims of $1.5 billion in 2023 and $653 million in 2022.
Underwriting expenses decreased $752 million (16.5%) in 2023 compared to 2022. The expense ratio in 2023 was 9.7%, a decrease of 2.0 percentage points compared to 2022, attributable to reduced advertising expenses and improved operating leverage.
