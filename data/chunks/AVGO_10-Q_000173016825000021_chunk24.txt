February 2, 2025 from $2,898 million at November 3, 2024. The decrease was primarily attributable to the following:
•
Short-term debt increased to $5,653 million at February 2, 2025 from $1,271 million at November 3, 2024 primarily due to the issuance of $4,000 million of commercial paper and $900 million of senior notes becoming due within the next twelve months, offset in part by a $495 million repayment.
•
Other current liabilities increased to $12,430 million at February 2, 2025 from $11,793 million at November 3, 2024 primarily from higher contract liabilities.
•
Accounts payable increased to $1,905 million at February 2, 2025 from $1,662 million at November 3, 2024 primarily due to the timing of payments.
These decreases in working capital were offset in part by the following:
•
Employee compensation and benefits decreased to $922 million at February 2, 2025 from $1,971 million at November 3, 2024 primarily due to annual employee bonus plan payments.

Cash Flows
Operating Activities
Cash flows from operating activities consist of net income adjusted for certain non-cash and other items and changes in assets and liabilities. The $1,298 million increase in cash provided by operations during the fiscal quarter ended February 2, 2025 compared to the prior year fiscal period was primarily due to $4,178 million higher net income, offset in part by $2,068 million from changes in operating assets and liabilities. The lower net income in the prior year fiscal period was partially driven by higher non-cash adjustments including deferred taxes and other non-cash taxes, stock-based compensation, and amortization of intangible assets.
Investing Activities
Cash flows from investing activities primarily consist of cash related to acquisitions and divestitures, capital expenditures and proceeds and payments related to investments. The $25,303 million decrease in cash used in investing activities during the fiscal quarter ended February 2, 2025 compared to the prior year fiscal period
