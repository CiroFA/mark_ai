addition, the IRA enacted a 1% excise tax on corporate stock repurchases completed after December 31, 2022. KKR does not expect to have a CAMT liability for the three months ended March 31, 2025. KKR will continue to review and monitor the issuance of additional guidance from the U.S. Treasury and the IRS.
On December 20, 2021, the OECD released Pillar Two Model Rules, which contemplate a global 15% minimum tax rate. The OECD continues to release additional guidance, including administrative guidance on interpretation and application of Pillar Two, and many countries have passed legislation and others continue to work towards passing legislation to comply with Pillar Two. The changes contemplated by Pillar Two, when enacted by various countries in which we do business, may increase our taxes in such countries. Based on the available legislation, KKR concluded there was no material impact on income taxes with respect to Pillar Two for the three months ended March 31, 2025. KKR will continue to evaluate the potential future impacts of Pillar Two and will continue to review and monitor the issuance of additional guidance.

EQUITY-BASED COMPENSATION
The following table summarizes the expense associated with equity-based compensation in connection with KKR equity incentive awards for the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively.
KKR Equity Incentive Awards
Under KKR's equity incentive plans, KKR is permitted to grant equity awards representing ownership interests in KKR & Co. Inc. common stock. On March 29, 2019, the Amended and Restated KKR & Co. Inc. 2019 Equity Incentive Plan (the "2019 Equity Incentive Plan") became effective. Following the effectiveness of the 2019 Equity Incentive Plan, KKR no longer makes further grants under the Amended and Restated KKR & Co. Inc. 2010 Equity Incentive Plan (the "2010 Equity Incentive Plan" and, together with the 2019 Equity Incentive Plan, our "Equity Incentive Plans"), and the 2019 Equity Incentive Plan became KKR's only plan for providing new equity awards by KKR & Co. Inc. Outstanding awards under the 2010 Equity Incentive Plan will remain outstanding, unchanged and subject to the terms of the 2010 Equity Incentive Plan and their respective equity award agreements, until the vesting, expiration or lapse of such awards in accordance with their terms. The total number of equity awards representing shares of common stock that may be issued under the 2019 Equity Incentive Plan is equivalent to
15
% of the aggregate number of the shares of common stock and KKR Group Partnership Units (excluding KKR Group Partnership Units held by KKR & Co. Inc. or its wholly-owned subsidiaries), subject to annual adjustment. As of March 31, 2025,
53,310,580
shares may be issued under the 2019 Equity Incentive Plan. KKR has also issued equity grants in the form of restricted holdings units through KKR Holdings III L.P. ("KKR Holdings III"), which are not issued under the 2019 Equity
