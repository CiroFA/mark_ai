Property, plant and equipment and equipment held for lease
We use property, plant and equipment in our operations. We also own equipment that we lease to others under lease contracts. We record additions, improvements and betterments to such properties at cost. With respect to constructed assets, all materials, direct labor and contract services as well as certain indirect costs, including interest over the construction period, are capitalized. With respect to constructed assets that are subject to authoritative guidance for regulated operations, capitalized costs also include an allowance for funds used during construction, which represents the cost of equity funds used to finance the construction of the regulated facilities. Normal repairs and maintenance and other costs that do not improve the property, extend its useful life or otherwise do not meet capitalization criteria are charged to expense as incurred.
Depreciation expense of our regulated utilities and railroad is generally determined using group depreciation methods where rates are based on periodic depreciation studies approved by the applicable regulator. Under group depreciation, a composite rate is applied to the gross investment in a particular class of property, despite differences in the service life or salvage value of individual property units within the same class. When such assets are retired or sold, no gain or loss is recognized. Gains or losses on disposals of all other assets are recorded through earnings. Ranges of estimated useful lives of depreciable assets unique to our railroad business are as follows: track structure and other roadway –
10
to
100 years
and locomotives, freight cars and other equipment –
6
to
45 years
. Ranges of estimated useful lives of assets unique to our utilities and energy businesses are as follows: utility generation, transmission and distribution systems –
5
to
80 years
, interstate natural gas pipeline assets –
3
to
80 years
and independent power plants and other assets –
2
to
50 years
.
We depreciate property, plant and equipment used in operations by our other businesses to the estimated salvage value primarily using the straight-line method over estimated service lives. Ranges of estimated service lives of depreciable assets used in our other businesses are as follows: buildings and improvements –
5
to
50 years
, machinery and equipment –
3
to
30 years
and furniture, fixtures and other –
4
to
15 years
. We depreciate the equipment held for lease to estimated salvage value primarily using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives ranging from
3
to
35 years
. We use declining balance depreciation
