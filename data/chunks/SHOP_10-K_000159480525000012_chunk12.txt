EXPLANATORY NOTE
Shopify Inc., a corporation existing under the Canada Business Corporations Act, qualifies as a foreign private issuer in the United States ("U.S.") for purposes of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Although, as a foreign private issuer, Shopify Inc. is not required to do so, Shopify Inc. has chosen to file annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") instead of filing the reporting forms available to foreign private issuers.
Shopify Inc. intends to prepare and file a management information circular and related materials under Canadian requirements. As Shopify Inc.'s management information circular is not filed pursuant to Regulation 14A, Shopify Inc. may not incorporate by reference information required by Part III of this Annual Report on Form 10-K from its management information circular. Accordingly, in reliance upon and as permitted by General Instruction G(3) to Form 10-K, Shopify Inc. will be filing an amendment to this Annual Report on Form 10-K containing the Part III information no later than 120 days after the end of the fiscal year covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
