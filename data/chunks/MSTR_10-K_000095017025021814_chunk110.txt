During 2023, our benefit from income taxes primarily related to the release of a valuation allowance on our deferred tax asset related to the impairment on our bitcoin holdings, attributable to the increase in market value of bitcoin as of December 31, 2023 compared to December 31, 2022.
The U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act imposed a mandatory deemed repatriation transition tax (“Transition Tax”) on previously untaxed accumulated and current earnings and profits of certain of our foreign subsidiaries.
