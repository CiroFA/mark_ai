while also completing
two major train turnarounds. In early 2025, TCO
started oil production at the Future Growth Project (FGP)
. FGP is the third processing plant in operation at the Tengiz oil field, which is expected to increase crude oil production by 260,000 barrels per day at full capacity and ramp-up total output to one million barrels of oil-equivalent per day.
The Karachaganak field is located in northwest Kazakhstan, and operations are conducted under a PSA that expires in 2038. During 2024, a majority of the exported liquids were transported through the CPC pipeline. In 2024, the Karachaganak Expansion Project Stage 1A facility scope
was completed with final associated injector well to be completed in first-half 2025 and Stage 1B continued development expecting to complete second-half 2026. Both projects increase gas re-injection capacity and extend stable field production. Proved reserves have been recognized for both projects.
