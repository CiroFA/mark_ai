Outside services increased by $48 million during the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to the prior year. The remaining increase was primarily due to expenses associated with software, maintenance and other costs to support the expansion of our data center capacity of $27 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to the prior year. These costs were partially offset by a decrease in program spend of $12 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to the prior year.
We expect R&D expenses for the year ending December 31, 2025 to increase in absolute dollars but remain relatively flat as a percentage of revenue compared to the year ended December 31, 2024, as we continue to improve the existing functionality of our services, develop new applications to fill market needs and enhance our core platform.
General and Administrative
General and administrative expenses (“G&A”) increased by $73 million during the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to the prior year, primarily due to increased headcount resulting in an increase in personnel-related costs, excluding stock-based compensation, of $37 million. The remaining increase was primarily due to an increase in other corporate expenses and outside services of $67 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to the prior year. These costs were partially offset by a decrease in stock-based compensation of $36 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to the prior year, primarily due to the requisite service period of certain performance awards being met.
We expect G&A expenses for the year ending December 31, 2025 to increase in absolute dollars but remain relatively flat as a percentage of revenue compared to the year ended December 31, 2024, as we continue to see leverage from continued G&A productivity.

Stock-based Compensation
Stock-based compensation increased by $142 million during the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to the prior year, primarily due to additional grants to current and new employees.
Stock-based compensation is inherently difficult to forecast due to fluctuations in our stock price. Based upon our stock price as of December 31, 2024, we expect stock-based compensation to continue to increase in absolute dollars for the year ending December 31, 2025 as we continue to issue stock-based awards to our employees but remain relatively flat as a percentage of revenue compared to the year ended December 31, 2024. We expect stock-based compensation as a percentage of revenue to decline over time as we continue to grow.
