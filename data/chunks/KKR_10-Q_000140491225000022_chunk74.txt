CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION (UNAUDITED) (CONTINUED)
(Amounts in Thousands)
The following presents the portion of the consolidated balances provided in the consolidated statements of financial condition attributable to consolidated variable interest entities ("VIEs"). As of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, KKR's consolidated VIEs consist primarily of (i) certain collateralized financing entities ("CFEs") including those CFEs holding collateralized loan obligations ("CLOs"), (ii) certain investment funds, and (iii) certain VIEs formed by Global Atlantic. The noteholders, creditors, and equity holders of these VIEs have no recourse to the assets of any other KKR entity.
With respect to consolidated CFEs and certain investment funds, the following assets may only be used to settle obligations of these consolidated VIEs and the following liabilities are only the obligations of these consolidated VIEs and not generally to KKR. Additionally, KKR has no right to the benefits from, nor does KKR bear the risks associated with, the assets held by these VIEs beyond KKR's beneficial interest therein and any income generated from the VIEs. There are neither explicit arrangements nor does KKR hold implicit variable interests that would require KKR to provide any material ongoing financial support to the consolidated VIEs, beyond amounts previously committed to them, if any.
With respect to certain other VIEs consolidated by Global Atlantic, Global Atlantic has formed certain VIEs to either (i) hold investments, including fixed maturity securities, consumer and other loans, renewable energy, transportation, and real estate, or (ii) to conduct certain reinsurance activities with third party commitments. These VIEs issue beneficial interests primarily to Global Atlantic’s insurance companies.
