Risks Related to Our Business and Industry
Escalated or escalating U.S. tariffs, as well as countermeasures taken by affected countries, may have a negative effect on global economic conditions, financial markets and our business.
Our products are primarily manufactured in Malaysia, Vietnam, and Mexico, and we also procure a limited number of products directly from China. In addition, our contract manufacturing partners procure some components from China for use in the manufacturing of our products. Because our products are primarily manufactured internationally, the import of our products into the United States may be affected by changes in applicable tariff policies.
In 2018, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative ("USTR") enacted various Section 301 tariffs of 7.5%, 10%, 15% and 25% on certain imports into the U.S. from China, including communications equipment products and components manufactured and imported from China. USTR has continued to expand these Section 301 tariffs, which now rise up to 100% on certain products. In addition, since March 2025, the United States has imposed an additional 20% tariff on most products of China pursuant to an executive order.
In February 2025, the U.S. government also scheduled 25% tariffs to be imposed on products of Canada and Mexico pursuant to a separate executive order, with lower tariffs applicable to energy, energy resources, and potash (the “Canada-Mexico Tariffs”), which took effect in March 2025.
