This allows us capital market access for refinancing as well as for unforeseen or opportunistic capital needs.
Dividends
We have paid dividends each quarter since we became a public company in 1993. Under Swiss law, dividends must be stated in Swiss francs though dividend payments are made by Chubb in U.S. dollars. Refer to Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of our dividend methodology.
At our May 2024 annual general meeting, our shareholders approved an annual dividend for the following year of up to $3.64 per share, or CHF 3.29 per share, calculated using the USD/CHF exchange rate as published in the Wall Street Journal on May 16, 2024, expected to be paid in four quarterly installments of $0.91 per share after the general meeting by way of a distribution from capital contribution reserves, transferred to free reserves for payment. The Board determines the record and payment dates at which the annual dividend may be paid until the date of the 2025 annual general meeting and is authorized to abstain from distributing a dividend at its discretion. The four quarterly installments each of $0.91 per share were distributed by the Board as expected. The annual dividend approved in May 2024 represented a $0.20 per share increase ($0.05 per quarter) over the prior year dividend.
