recognized from beginning period deferred revenue during the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024 were $
2.6

Remaining Performance Obligations
Transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations (“RPO”) represents contracted revenue that has not yet been recognized, which includes deferred revenue and non-cancellable amounts that will be invoiced and recognized as revenues in future periods. RPO excludes contracts that are billed in arrears, such as certain time and materials contracts, as we apply the “right to invoice” practical expedient under relevant accounting guidance.
As of March 31, 2025, the total non-cancellable RPO under our contracts with customers was $
22.1
billion and we expect to recognize revenues on approximately
47
% of these RPO over the following
12
months. The majority of the non-current RPO will be recognized over the next
13
to
36
months.

1,490
million and $
1,489
million, respectively, net of unamortized debt discount and issuance costs of $
10
million and $
11
million, respectively.
We consider the fair value of the 2030 Notes at March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024 to be a Level 2 measurement. The estimated fair value of the 2030 Notes based on the closing trading price per $
100
, was $
1,267

1,247
million at March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively.
2030 Notes
In August 2020, we issued
1.40
% fixed rate
ten-year
notes with an aggregate principal amount of $
1.5
billion due on September 1, 2030 (the “2030 Notes”). The 2030 Notes were issued at
99.63
% of principal and we incurred $
13
million for debt issuance costs. The effective interest rate for the 2030 Notes was
1.53
% and included interest payable, amortization of debt issuance cost and amortization of debt discount. Interest is payable semi-annually in arrears on March 1 and September 1 of each year, beginning on March 1, 2021, and the entire outstanding principal amount is due at maturity on September 1, 2030. The 2030 Notes are unsecured obligations and the indentures governing the 2030 Notes contain customary events of default and covenants that, among others and subject to exceptions, restrict our ability to incur or guarantee debt secured by liens on specified assets or enter into sale and lease-back transactions with respect to specified properties.
