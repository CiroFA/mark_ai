adjustments to net income of $129.0 million. Cash inflows consisted of an increase in deferred revenue of $1.3 billion resulting from increased customer PCS contracts and an increase in product deferred revenue related to customer contracts with acceptance terms, and a $110.6 million decrease in inventory resulting from strong product shipments. These cash inflows were partially offset by a $234.2 million increase in other assets driven by increased deferred cost of sales associated with higher product revenue deferrals, an increase in accounts receivable of $106.1 million due to increased product and service billings and a $66.5 million increase in income tax payments due to timing. Net non-cash adjustments primarily consisted of an increase in deferred income taxes of $492.9 million primarily resulting from increased deferred tax assets associated with the increase in deferred revenue and capitalization of research and development costs under IRC Section 174, which were largely offset by $355.4 million of stock-based compensation expenses.

Net non-cash adjustments primarily consisted of an increase in deferred income taxes of $370.8 million primarily resulting from increased deferred tax assets associated with the capitalization of research and development costs under IRC Section 174, which were largely offset by $296.8 million of stock-based compensation expenses and $70.6 million of depreciation, amortization and other expenses. The change in working capital requirements primarily consisted of a $655.5 million increase in inventory in response to a significant increase in business volume, a $101.5 million increase in accounts receivable due to the larger business volume and timing of shipments in the fourth quarter of 2023, as well as a $66.4 million increase in other assets primarily driven by increased deferred cost of sales associated with higher product revenue deferrals.
