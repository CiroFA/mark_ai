Plan fiduciaries set investment policies and strategies for the principal pension plans and oversee their investment allocation, which includes selecting investment managers and setting long-term strategic targets. The plan fiduciaries' primary strategic investment objectives are balancing investment risk and return and monitoring the planâ€™s liquidity position in order to meet near-term benefit payment and other cash needs. The plan has incorporated de-risking objectives and liability hedging programs as part of its long-term investment strategy and utilizes a combination of long-dated corporate bonds, treasuries, strips and derivatives to implement its investment strategies as well as for hedging asset and liability risks. Target allocation percentages are established at an asset class level by plan fiduciaries. Target allocation ranges are guidelines, not limitations, and occasionally plan fiduciaries will approve allocations above or below a target range.
