guarantees, associated with GE Vernova
legal entities from GE to GE Vernova. For GE credit support that remained outstanding at the Spin-Off, GE Vernova is obligated to use
reasonable best efforts to terminate or replace, and obtain a full release of GEâ€™s obligations and liabilities under, all such credit support.
Beginning in April 2025, GE Vernova will pay a quarterly fee to GE based on amounts related to the GE credit support.
GE Vernova is
subject to other contractual restrictions and requirements while GE continues to be obligated under such credit support on behalf of GE
Vernova. In addition, while GE will remain obligated under the contract or instrument, GE Vernova will be obligated to indemnify GE for
credit support related payments that GE is required to make and possible related costs.

As of
March 31, 2025
, we estimated GE Vernova RPO and other obligations that relate to GE credit support to be approximately
$15 billion
,
an over
59%
reduction since the Spin-Off. We expect approximately
$9 billion
of the RPO related to GE credit support obligations to
contractually mature by December 31, 2029. The underlying obligations are predominantly customer contracts that GE Vernova performs in
the normal course of its business. We have no known instances historically where payments or performance from GE were required under
parent company guarantees relating to GE Vernova customer contracts.
