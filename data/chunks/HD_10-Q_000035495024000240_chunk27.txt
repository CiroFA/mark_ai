At the beginning of fiscal 2024, we had a commercial paper program that allowed for borrowings up to $5.0 billion. In connection with our program, we had back-up credit facilities with a consortium of banks for borrowings up to $5.0 billion, which consisted of a five-year $3.5 billion credit facility scheduled to expire in July 2027 and a 364-day $1.5 billion credit facility scheduled to expire in July 2024. At January 28, 2024, there were no outstanding borrowings under our commercial paper program or back-up credit facilities.
In May 2024, we increased our commercial paper program from $5.0 billion to $19.5 billion in connection with the anticipated financing of the acquisition of SRS (see
Note 10
for details regarding the SRS acquisition). In May 2024, in connection with the increase in the commercial paper program, we also entered into three additional back-up credit facilities that consisted of a 364-day $3.5 billion credit facility scheduled to expire in May 2025, a three-year $1.0 billion credit facility scheduled to expire in May 2027, and a 364-day $10.0 billion credit facility scheduled to expire in May 2025. The $10.0 billion credit facility also provided that the commitments and any borrowings under that facility would be reduced by the amount of net cash proceeds we received from any future debt issuance.
In June 2024, leading up to the acquisition of SRS on June 18, 2024, we raised commercial paper borrowings of over $15.0 billion to fund the transaction. On June 25, 2024, we received the proceeds from the issuance of $10.0 billion of long-term debt, and immediately used the proceeds to repay approximately $10.0 billion of these commercial paper borrowings. On June 27, 2024, we terminated the $10.0 billion back-up credit facility, and subsequently reduced our commercial paper program from $19.5 billion to $9.5 billion.
In July 2024, we completed the renewal of our 364-day $1.5 billion credit facility, extending the maturity from July 2024 to July 2025. As of October 27, 2024, our commercial paper program allowed for borrowings up to $9.5 billion and is supported by $9.5 billion of back-up credit facilities.
All of our short-term borrowings in the first nine months of fiscal 2024 were under our commercial paper program, and the maximum amount outstanding at any time was $15.3 billion. At October 27, 2024, we had outstanding borrowings under our commercial paper program of $1.3 billion with a weighted average interest rate of 4.8%, we had no outstanding borrowings under our back-up credit facilities, and we were in compliance with all of the covenants contained in our credit facilities, none of which are expected to impact our liquidity or capital resources.

We also issue senior notes from time to time as part of our capital management strategy. As discussed above, in June 2024, we issued $10.0 billion of senior notes in connection with the funding of the acquisition of SRS. Separately, in
