Decreases to earnings included lower revenues resulting from lower commodity prices of $73 million and the timing of sales as compared with 2023. Additional decreases to earnings included higher DD&A expenses of $175 million, driven by higher rates as a result of 2023 year-end downward reserve revisions as well as higher production and operating expenses of $90 million, driven by higher well work activity of $56 million and transportation related costs of $26 million.
Production
Average production decreased one MBOED in 2024 compared with 2023, primarily due to normal field decline.
The production decrease was partly offset by new wells online at our Western North Slope and Greater Kuparuk Area assets.
Acquisition of Additional Working Interest in Kuparuk River Unit and Prudhoe Bay Unit
After exercising our preferential rights, we completed an acquisition of additional working interest in both the Kuparuk River Unit and the Prudhoe Bay Unit in the fourth quarter of 2024. Production from the additional working interest averaged approximately five MBOED each month for November and December 2024.

Lower 48
The Lower 48 segment consists of operations located in the contiguous U.S. and the Gulf of Mexico and commercial operations. During 2024, the Lower 48 contributed 63 percent of our consolidated liquids production and 74 percent of our consolidated natural gas production.
Net Income (Loss)
Lower 48 reported earnings of $5,175 million in 2024, compared with earnings of $6,461 million in 2023.
Decreases to earnings included lower revenues resulting from lower overall commodity prices of $904 million and the timing of sales as compared with 2023, partly offset by higher volumes of $1,003 million, which includes volumes added from our acquisition of Marathon Oil. Additional decreases to earnings included higher DD&A of $562 million, driven by higher production of $250 million, higher rates of $181 million and impacts from our acquisition of Marathon Oil of $139 million; higher production and operating expenses of $431 million, driven by higher transportation related costs of $132 million, expenses associated with our acquisition of Marathon Oil of $110 million and higher lease operating expenses of $100 million; as well as the absence of gains associated with the divestiture of an equity investment of $100 million.

The production increase was partly offset by normal field decline and higher unplanned downtime across all basins.
Acquisition of Marathon Oil
On November 22, 2024, we completed our acquisition of Marathon Oil. The transaction added additional assets to our Lower 48 segment across several basins. Production from Lower 48 assets acquired from Marathon
