Unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses
Reconciliations of the changes in unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses (“claim liabilities”), excluding liabilities under retroactive reinsurance contracts (see Note 17), for each of the three years ended December 31, 2024 follow (in millions).
Net liabilities of acquired businesses in 2022 related to the acquisition of Alleghany’s insurance companies in October 2022.
Our claim liabilities under property and casualty insurance and reinsurance contracts are based upon estimates of the ultimate claim costs associated with claim events that have occurred as of the balance sheet date and include estimates for incurred-but-not-reported (“IBNR”) claims. Losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred shown in the preceding table related to events occurring in the current year (“current accident year”) and events occurring in all prior years (“prior accident years”). Losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred and paid are net of reinsurance recoveries. Current accident year incurred losses included losses from significant catastrophe events (losses exceeding $
150
million per event) of approximately $
1.5
billion in 2024, $
925
million in 2023 and $
3.1
billion in 2022. Current accident year incurred losses for private passenger auto insurance declined in 2024 compared to 2023, reflecting lower claims frequencies and higher average claims severities. Current accident year incurred losses in 2023 also reflected a decline in private passenger auto insurance losses and the impact of the Alleghany acquisition compared to 2022.

Unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses
We recorded net reductions of estimated ultimate liabilities for prior accident years of $
2.3
billion in 2024, $
3.5
billion in 2023 and $
2.7
billion in 2022, which produced corresponding reductions in losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred in those periods. These reductions, as percentages of the net liabilities at the beginning of each year, were
2.2
% in 2024,
3.5
% in 2023 and
3.2
% in 2022.
Estimated ultimate liabilities for prior accident years of our primary insurance businesses declined $
602
million in 2024, $
2.1
billion in 2023 and $
1.1
billion in 2022. The decline in estimated liabilities in 2024 reflected lower-than-expected private passenger auto, medical professional liability and property losses, partially offset by increased casualty losses. The estimated liability reductions in 2023 and 2022 were primarily from private passenger auto, medical professional liability and property coverages. Estimated ultimate liabilities for prior accident years of our reinsurance businesses were reduced $
1.7
billion in 2024, $
1.4
billion in 2023 and $
