(3)    Goodwill impairment of $
535
million (approximately $
489
million after-tax) was incurred in the Asia Consumer reporting unit of Legacy Franchises in the first quarter of 2022, due to the resegmentation and change of reporting units as well as the sequence of the signing of sale agreements.
(4)    Goodwill allocated to the global fiduciary and trust administration services business was classified as HFS during the third quarter of 2024.
Citi performed its annual goodwill impairment test, which resulted in no impairment of any of Citi’s reporting units’ goodwill. No additional triggering events were identified during the fourth quarter of 2024 and no goodwill was impaired during 2024.
Unanticipated declines in business performance, increases in credit losses, increases in capital requirements and adverse regulatory or legislative changes, as well as deterioration in economic or market conditions, are factors that could result in a material impairment loss to earnings in a future period related to some portion of the associated goodwill.
For additional information regarding Citi’s goodwill impairment testing process, see Note 1 for Citi’s accounting policy for goodwill and Note 3 for a description of Citi’s operating segments.
