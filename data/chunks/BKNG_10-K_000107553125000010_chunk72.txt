Advertising and other revenues
Advertising and other revenues are derived primarily from:
•
revenues earned by KAYAK for (a) sending referrals to OTCs and travel service providers and (b) advertising placements on its platforms; and
•
revenues earned by OpenTable for (a) restaurant reservation services (fees paid by restaurants for diners seated through OpenTable's online reservation service) and (b) subscription fees for restaurant management services.

The year-over-year increase in merchant revenues in 2024 was also due to strong growth in revenues from merchant accommodation reservation services at Agoda. Advertising and other revenues increased in 2024 compared to 2023 due to growth in advertising revenues at Booking.com and growth at OpenTable.
