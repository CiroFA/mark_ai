activities, owns, develops, constructs and operates rate-regulated transmission facilities and transmission lines and invests in natural gas, natural gas liquids and oil production assets. NEER’s net income less net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests for 2024 and 2023 was $2,299 million and $3,558 million, respectively, resulting in a decrease in 2024 of $1,259 million. The primary drivers, on an after-tax basis, of the change are in the following table.
______________________
(a)    Reflects after-tax project contributions, including the net effect of deferred income taxes and other benefits associated with renewable energy tax credits for wind, solar and storage projects, as applicable (see Note 1 – Income Taxes and – Noncontrolling Interests and Note 5), but excludes allocation of interest expense and corporate general and administrative expenses except for an allocated credit support charge related to guarantees issued to conduct business activities. Results from projects, pipelines and rate-regulated transmission facilities and transmission lines are included in new investments during the first twelve months of operation or ownership. Project results, including repowered wind projects, and pipeline results are included in existing clean energy and rate-regulated transmission facilities and transmission lines are included in NEET beginning with the thirteenth month of operation or ownership.
(b)    Excludes allocation of interest expense and corporate general and administrative expenses except for an allocated credit support charge related to guarantees issued to conduct business activities and includes natural gas, natural gas liquids and oil production results.
(c)    See Overview – Adjusted Earnings for additional information.
New Investments
Results from new investments in 2024 increased primarily due to higher earnings related to new wind and solar generation and battery storage facilities that entered service during or after 2023.
Other Factors
Supplemental to the primary drivers of the changes in NEER's results discussed above, the discussion below describes changes in certain line items set forth in NEE's consolidated statements of income as they relate to NEER.
Operating Revenues
Operating revenues for 2024 decreased $2,130 million primarily due to:
•
the impact of non-qualifying commodity hedges due primarily to changes in energy prices (approximately $66 million of losses during 2024 compared to $2,529 million of gains for 2023),
partly offset by,
•
revenues from new investments of $494 million.
Operating Expenses
–
net
Operating expenses – net for 2024 increased $932 million primarily due to increases of $568 million in depreciation and amortization expenses, $175 million in O&M expenses and $119 million in fuel, purchased power and interchange expenses. The increases were primarily associated with growth across the NEER businesses and higher depletion related to natural gas and oil production.
