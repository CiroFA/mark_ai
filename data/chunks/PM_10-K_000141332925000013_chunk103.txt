Premarket tobacco applications for 20 varieties of
ZYN
nicotine pouches were submitted in March 2020. In the same month, these applications were filed for scientific review and in July 2020 the FDA issued a deficiency letter, which Swedish Match USA, Inc. addressed in September 2020. On January 16, 2025, the FDA determined that all 20
ZYN
nicotine pouch varieties currently marketed in the U.S. met the applicable public health standard and were appropriate for the protection of public health, and therefore authorized them for sale in the United States. In their assessment, the FDA concluded that “among several key considerations, the agency’s evaluation showed that, due to substantially lower amounts of harmful constituents than cigarettes and most smokeless tobacco products, such as moist snuff and snus, the authorized products pose lower risk of cancer and other serious health conditions than such products.” Prior to the authorization these 20 varieties of
ZYN
pouches were marketed in the U.S.  consistent with the FDA's practice not to take enforcement action to prevent products with respect to which applications were filed
61
prior to a September 9, 2020 deadline from being marketed. After the September 9, 2020 deadline, we also submitted additional applications for authorization to market other
ZYN
products. We are unable to market these products until the FDA authorizes such applications. In April 2024, we submitted MRTPAs for
ZYN
products currently marketed in the U.S. and requested authorization of the modified risk claim. As these applications proceed through the review process, the FDA may request additional information or conduct subsequent inspections to verify the submitted information.
On July 17, 2023, Swedish Match USA, Inc. submitted a renewal application to the FDA requesting re-authorization to continue to market its eight snus smokeless tobacco products (sold under the
General
snus brand name) with a modified risk claim.
General
snus products received modified risk orders on October 22, 2019. Swedish Match USA, Inc. was authorized to market these products with the claim, “Using
General
snus instead of cigarettes puts you at a lower risk of mouth cancer, heart disease, lung cancer, stroke, emphysema, and chronic bronchitis.” On November 7, 2024, the FDA renewed the
General
snus modified risk orders, with a stated expiration date in November 2032.
Other Commercialization and Risk Statement Authorization Frameworks
: On March 22, 2023, a bill amending the Tobacco Hazards Prevention and Control Act in Taiwan went into effect. It regulates heated tobacco products and bans e-cigarettes. The amendment particularly specifies that designated tobacco products (including heated tobacco products) that are not cigarettes, cut tobacco, cigars, snuff nor chewing tobacco, must undergo a health risk assessment as part of an authorization system. We have filed an authorization request to commercialize
IQOS
in Taiwan pursuant to this Act, but this
