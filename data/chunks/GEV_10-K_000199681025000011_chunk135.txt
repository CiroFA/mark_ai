The Company uses the spot method to assess hedge effectiveness for its net investment hedges. As such, for derivative instruments
designated as net investment hedges, changes in fair value of the designated hedging instruments attributable to fluctuations in foreign
currency spot exchange rates only are initially recorded as a component of the cumulative translation adjustments in AOCI until the hedged
investment is either sold or substantially liquidated. All other changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument are recognized in current
earnings.
Non-Designated Hedges. The Company also executes derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forward contracts and commodity
swaps, that are not designated in qualifying hedging relationships under U.S. GAAP. These derivatives are intended to serve as economic
hedges of foreign currency and commodity price risk, and depending on the derivative type, hedges of monetary assets and liabilities,
including intercompany balances subject to remeasurement.
The changes in fair value of non-designated hedges are recorded in line items in the Consolidated and Combined Statement of Income
(Loss) based on the nature of the derivative contract and the underlying item being economically hedged. The cash flows associated with
non-designated hedges are recorded in the same category as the cash flows from the items being economically hedged and are thus
primarily through investing and operating activities of the Consolidated and Combined Statement of Cash Flows.
The following table presents the gross fair values of our outstanding derivative instruments as of the dates indicated:
