related relationships, VCF in-process research and development, and the VMware trade name intangible assets acquired in the VMware acquisition is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when developing the fair value estimates; (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management’s significant assumptions related to (a) the projected revenues, projected expenses, technology obsolescence rate, contributory asset charges, and discount rate for the VCF developed technology, (b) certain projected revenues, customer retention rate, customer ramp up period, and discount rate for the certain customer contracts and related relationships, (c) the projected revenues, technology obsolescence rate and discount rate for the VCF in-process research and development, and (d) certain projected revenues, brand asset phase-out pattern, brand asset royalty rate, and discount rate for the VMware trade name (collectively referred to as “the aforementioned significant assumptions”); and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.
Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the acquisition accounting, including controls over management’s valuation of the acquired developed technology, customer contracts and related relationships, in-process research and development, and the trade names. These procedures also included, among others, (i) reading the purchase agreement; (ii) testing management’s process for developing the fair value estimate of the acquired VCF developed technology, certain customer contracts and related relationships, VCF in-process research and development, and the VMware trade name; (iii) evaluating the appropriateness of the multi-period excess earnings, with-and-without, and relief-from-royalty methods used by management; (iv) testing the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used in the multi-period excess earnings, with-and-without, and relief-from-royalty methods; and (v) evaluating the reasonableness of the aforementioned significant assumptions used by management. Evaluating management’s assumptions related to (a) the projected revenues and projected expenses for the VCF developed technology, (b) certain projected revenues, customer retention rate, and customer ramp up period for the certain customer contracts and related relationships, (c) projected revenues for the VCF in-process research and development, and (d) certain projected revenues for the VMware trade name involved considering (i) the current and past performance of VMware; (ii) the consistency with external market and industry data; and (iii) whether the assumptions were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit.
