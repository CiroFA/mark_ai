credit.
We enter into fixed-price contracts with our customers and our failure to mitigate certain risks associated with such contracts
may result in reduced operating margins.
Some of our contracts have been established on a fixed-price basis which commit us to a
specific price well before the completion of the applicable project. However, actual revenues or costs may be different from those we
originally estimated and may result in reduced profitability or losses on projects. Some of these risks include:
•
difficulties encountered on our large-scale projects related to the procurement of materials or due to schedule disruptions, product
performance failures, unforeseen site conditions, rejection clauses in customer contracts, or other factors that may result in
additional costs to us, reductions in revenue, claims, or disputes;
•
our inability to obtain compensation for additional work we perform or expenses we incur as a result of unanticipated technical
issues or our customers providing deficient design, engineering information, products, or materials;
•
reliance on historical cost and/or execution data that is not representative of current conditions, including as a result of inflation
and increases in labor and material costs;
•
delays or productivity issues caused by weather conditions, or other force majeure events (e.g., pandemics);
•
requirements to pay liquidated or other damages, upon our failure to meet schedule or performance requirements of our contracts;
•
difficulties in engaging third-party subcontractors, product manufacturers, or materials suppliers or failures by third-party
subcontractors, product manufacturers, or materials suppliers to perform could result in project delays and cause us to incur
additional costs; and
•
modifications to projects that create unanticipated costs or delays.
As a result of one or more of these factors, we may incur losses or contracts may not be as profitable as we expect, and this could
materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition.
Risks Relating to Industry Dynamics
The strategic priorities and financial performance of many of our businesses are subject to market and other dynamics related to
decarbonization, which can pose risks in addition to opportunities.
Given the nature of our businesses and the industries we serve,
we must anticipate and respond to market, technological, regulatory, governmental policy, and other changes driven by broader trends
related to decarbonization efforts in response to climate change and energy security. In particular, we provide products, solutions, and
services to utilities and other customers in the power generation sector, which has historically been carbon intensive and has been in the
midst of a transition with global efforts to lower greenhouse gas emissions. For example, the significant decreases in recent years in the
cost of energy for renewable sources of power generation (such as wind and
