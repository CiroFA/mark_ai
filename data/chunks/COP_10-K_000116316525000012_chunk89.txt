based on product and activity benchmarks. The benchmarks and guidance for these emissions have yet to be finalized, and compliance payments are not due until later in 2025. Based on interim benchmarks, our BC OBPS obligation is expected to total $1.5 million (net share before-tax) for Montney in 2024.

In 2024, the EU passed regulation on the reduction of methane emissions in the energy sector that will apply a methane limit on oil and gas imports to the EU, as well as mandate the monitoring, reporting, verification and reduction of methane emissions.

Our APLNG assets in Australia are subject to the Safeguard Mechanism, enacted through the National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting Act 2007. In the previous Australian financial year of July 1, 2023, to June 30, 2024, our operated downstream APLNG facility was in excess of its baseline emissions, while the upstream partner-operated facilities were below their baseline emissions. As we expect there to be a surplus of eligible carbon units across the joint venture, there is no expense expected to be incurred by ConocoPhillips for the 2024 Australian financial year.

In 2024 the U.S. EPA published final rulemaking for New Source Performance Standards (OOOOb) and Emissions Guidelines (OOOOc). Implementing this regulation across our U.S. portfolio will result in additional compliance costs.
•
In connection with OOOOb and OOOOc rulemaking, the U.S. EPA established the Methane Super Emitter Program whereby certified third parties can use EPA-approved technology to identify and report super-emitter events for EPA review. An operator must initiate an investigation within five days of receiving notification from the EPA regarding a super-emitter event.

In November 2024, the U.S. EPA finalized the Waste Emissions Charge (WEC) as part of the Methane Emission Reduction Program (MERP) within the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. The implementation of the WEC will require payments to the EPA, accounting for methane emissions subject to the rule. The filing deadline for the 2024 WEC is August 2025.
Carbon taxes in certain jurisdictions.
•
We incurred carbon tax cost in our Montney operations in the first three months of 2024, before the BC OBPS came into force. We may also incur a carbon tax for any emissions in Montney that falls outside the scope of our BC OBPS activities. We also incur a nominal carbon tax for emissions from fossil fuel combustion at some of our Surmont operations in Alberta that occur outside of TIER facilities. Carbon tax costs in our Canada operations totaled $1.7 million (net share before-tax).
•
Our cost of compliance with Norwegian carbon legislation in 2024 was approximately $37 million (net share before-tax).

The White House Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) issued final National Environmental Policy Act implementation regulations (NEPA Phase 2) in 2024. Since then, the DC Circuit Court has suggested that CEQ lacks authority to adopt any
