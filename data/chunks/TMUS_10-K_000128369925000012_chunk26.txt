culture and success. We want to deliver the best experiences from the best teams, and one way we do that is by offering an array of development programs and resources to build diverse talent and empower our people to succeed through every step of their career. We put employees in the driver’s seat and give them access to mentoring, training, videos, books, job search and interview tips, and much more.
By strategically investing in the following three key areas of career development and learning, we are developing our talent now and for the future.
•
Evolve skills and careers – Learn every day, champion relentless improvement, develop critical skills, explore career possibilities, and build the desired career;
•
Advance leadership expertise – Build critical leadership capabilities, enable leadership growth at all levels, and develop skills to lead in the future; and
•
Champion belonging and inclusion – Promote inclusive habits and behaviors and enhance belonging and connectedness.
Belonging and Inclusion
Our diversity, equity and inclusion efforts are focused on fostering a workplace that helps us better serve our customers and communities across the nation. We aim to create an environment where employees feel included, valued and empowered, contributing to a stronger, more connected business. T-Mobile has an inclusive hiring process that seeks diverse talent to be candidates for employment, but all of our hiring decisions continue to be based solely on merit.
Employee Resource Groups (ERGs)
Many of our employees participate in one of six Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) and their sub-groups, which are instrumental in promoting connection. Each of these groups is open to any and all employees, and there are 38 chapters nationwide that organize volunteer opportunities and local events.

External Diversity Councils
In partnership with civil rights organizations, we had previously established two External Diversity and Inclusion Councils. These councils offered guidance for our efforts in areas like workforce recruitment, procurement, community investment, and corporate governance. The work with these external councils concluded as planned after a successful 5-year collaboration and the councils have been dissolved.
Suppliers
T-Mobile considers a broad range of suppliers, including those that are veteran-owned, disability-owned, woman-owned, minority-owned, and LGBT-owned, and we include small and large
