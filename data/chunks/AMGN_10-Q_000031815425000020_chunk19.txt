Equity method investments
Neumora Therapeutics, Inc.
As of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, our ownership interests in Neumora were approximately
21.8
% and
21.9
%, respectively, and the fair values of our investment were $
35
million and $
375
million, respectively, which were included in Other noncurrent assets in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Although our equity investment qualifies us for the equity method of accounting, we have elected the fair value option to account for our investment. Under the fair value option, changes in the fair value of the investment are recognized through earnings in Other income (expense), net, in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss) each reporting period. See Note 11, Fair value measurement. We believe the fair value option best reflects the economics of the underlying transaction. During the three months ended March 31, 2025, we recognized an unrealized loss of $
340
million,
compared to an unrealized loss of $
117
million for the same period in the prior year.
We are contractually restricted from selling more than
5.0
% of Neumora’s outstanding common stock in any rolling 12-month period for as long as we hold at least
10.0
% of their outstanding common stock, subject to certain exceptions or otherwise agreed to by Neumora.
Limited partnerships
We held limited
partnership investments
of $
252
