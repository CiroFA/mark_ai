dividends in full on such dividend senior stock.
As of March 31, 2025, excluding intercompany indebtedness, we had approximately $8.22 billion in aggregate principal amount of consolidated indebtedness outstanding, all of which ranks senior to our preferred stock and our common stock.
In addition, our subsidiaries have no obligation to pay any amounts on the Perpetual Strike Preferred Stock or Perpetual Strife Preferred Stock. If any of our subsidiaries liquidates, dissolves or winds up, whether voluntarily or involuntarily, then we, as a direct or indirect common equity owner of that subsidiary, will be subject to the prior claims of that subsidiary’s creditors, including trade creditors and

preferred equity holders, if any. We may never receive any amounts from that subsidiary, and, accordingly, the assets of that subsidiary may never be available to make payments on the Perpetual Strike Preferred Stock or Perpetual Strife Preferred Stock.
We may not have sufficient funds to pay dividends in cash on our preferred stock, or we may choose not to pay dividends on our preferred stock and regulatory and contractual restrictions may prevent us from declaring or paying dividends
We expect to fund any dividends paid in cash on our preferred stock primarily through additional capital raising activities, including, but not limited to, at-the-market offerings of our class A common stock, and in the case of our Perpetual Strife Preferred Stock, offerings of our Perpetual Strike Preferred Stock. However, our ability to declare and pay cash dividends on our preferred stock will depend on many factors, including the following:
•
our financial condition, including the amount of cash we have on hand;
•
the amount of cash, if any, generated by our operations and financing activities (including our ability to raise additional capital from the equity capital markets on favorable terms or at all);
•
our anticipated financing needs, including the amounts needed to service our indebtedness or other obligations;
•
the degree to which we decide to reinvest any cash generated by our operations or financing activities to fund our future operations;
•
the ability of our subsidiaries to distribute funds to us;
•
regulatory restrictions on our ability to pay dividends, including under the Delaware General Corporation Law;
•
our ability to sell equity securities under new at-the-market offering programs; and
•
contractual restrictions on our ability to pay dividends.
In addition, subject to a limited exception, our board of directors may choose not to pay accumulated dividends on our preferred stock for any reason. Accordingly, we may pay less than the full amount of accumulated dividends on our preferred stock. In addition, if we fail to declare and pay accumulated dividends on our preferred stock in full, then the value of our preferred stock will likely decline.
Provisions contained in the instruments governing our future indebtedness may restrict or prohibit us from
