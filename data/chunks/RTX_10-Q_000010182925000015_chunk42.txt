While the timing of cash flows are subject to a number of variables, for the Powder Metal Matter we estimate the accrual for expected customer compensation to be utilized consistent with the timing of execution of the fleet management plan, the period of increased aircraft on ground levels, and contractual terms with customers. We currently estimate a full year 2025 cash impact related to the Powder Metal Matter of approximately $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion, which includes the impact of cash paid, customer credits applied, and the timing of partner recovery.
