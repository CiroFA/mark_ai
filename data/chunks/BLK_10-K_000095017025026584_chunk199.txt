In December 2024, BlackRock announced that it had entered into a definitive agreement to acquire
100
% of the business and assets of HPS Investment Partners ("HPS"), a leading global credit investment manager with
100
% of the consideration paid in BlackRock equity (the "HPS Transaction"). The equity will generally be delivered in units of a wholly-owned subsidiary of BlackRock (“SubCo Units”) which will be exchangeable on a one-for-one basis (subject to certain adjustments) into BlackRock common stock (accordingly, the value of each unit delivered will be based on the price of a share of BlackRock’s common stock and the specific terms of the SubCo Units). Approximately
9.2
million SubCo Units and RSUs will be paid at closing. Approximately
2.9
million SubCo Units, will be paid in approximately five years, subject to the satisfaction of certain post-closing conditions. In addition, there is potential for additional consideration to be earned of up to
1.6
million SubCo Units that is based on financial performance milestones measured and paid in approximately five years. Of the total deal consideration, up to
0.7
million units will be used to fund an equity retention pool for HPS employees. In aggregate, inclusive of all SubCo Units paid at closing, eligible to be paid in approximately five years, and potentially earned through achievement of financial performance milestones as well as BlackRock RSUs to be issued in the transaction, the maximum amount of common stock issuable upon exchange of such SubCo Units would be approximately
13.7
million shares. The Company expects the addition of HPS will create an integrated private credit platform to provide both public and private income solutions for clients across their whole portfolios. The HPS Transaction is anticipated to close in mid-2025 subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions.
