our total borrowings were $31.1 billion and $20.4 billion, respectively.
A key source of liquidity is our ability to access the corporate bond markets. Through these markets, we issue a variety of long-term fixed rate notes to manage our overall funding costs.
Another key source of liquidity is our ability to access the commercial paper market. Commercial paper notes are sold at a discount or premium and have a maturity of not more than 365 days from date of issuance. Borrowings under the commercial paper program are available for general corporate purposes as well as for financing acquisitions. The weighted average interest rate on commercial paper and other short-term borrowings outstanding was 4.22% and 4.29% as of December 31, 2024, and 2023, respectively.
We also have the following loan and revolving credit agreements:
•
A $1.0 billion Fixed Rate Term Loan Credit Agreement (the Fixed Rate Term Loan Credit Agreement), dated as of August 12, 2024. Amounts borrowed under the Fixed Rate Term Loan Credit Agreement are required to be repaid no later than August 12, 2027, unless the Fixed Rate Term Loan Credit Agreement is terminated earlier pursuant to its terms. As of December 31, 2024, there were $1.0 billion of borrowings outstanding under the Fixed Rate Term Loan Credit Agreement.
•
A $1.5 billion 364-day credit agreement (the 364-Day Credit Agreement) with a syndicate of banks, dated as of March 18, 2024. Amounts borrowed under the 364-Day Credit Agreement are required to be repaid no later than March 17, 2025, unless (i) we elect to convert all then outstanding amounts into a term loan, upon which such amounts shall be repaid in full on March 17, 2026, or (ii) the 364-Day Credit Agreement is terminated earlier pursuant to its terms. The 364-Day Credit Agreement replaced the previously reported $1.5 billion 364-day credit agreement dated as of March 20, 2023, which was terminated in accordance with its terms effective March 18, 2024. As of December 31, 2024, there were no outstanding borrowings under our 364-Day Credit Agreement.

Commitments under the Five-Year Credit Agreement can be increased pursuant to the terms of the Five-Year Credit Agreement to an aggregate amount not to exceed $4.5 billion. The Five-Year Credit Agreement amended and restated the previously reported $4.0 billion amended and restated five-year credit agreement dated as of March 20, 2023. As of December 31, 2024, there were no outstanding borrowings under our Five-Year Credit Agreement.
We also have a current shelf registration statement filed with the SEC under which we may issue additional debt securities, common stock, and preferred stock that may be offered in one or more offerings on terms to be determined at the time of the offering. We anticipate that net proceeds of any offering would be used for general corporate purposes,
