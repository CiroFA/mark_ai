reduced fixed interest rate, with terms ranging from
6
months to
72
months, most of which had a
60-month
term at March 31, 2025. In certain circumstances, the Corporation will forgive a portion of the outstanding balance if the borrower makes payments up to a set amount. The Corporation makes modifications directly with borrowers for loans held by the Corporation (internal programs) as well as through third-party renegotiation agencies that provide solutions to customers’ entire unsecured debt structures (external programs). The March 31, 2025 amortized cost of credit card and other consumer loans that were modified through these programs during the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024 and  was $
217
million and $
231
million. The  financial effect of modifications resulted in a weighted-average interest rate reduction of
18.37
percent compared to
19.80
percent and, principal forgiveness of $
25
million and $
28
million during the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024.
The Corporation tracks the performance of modified loans to assess effectiveness of modification programs.

million were greater than 90 days past due.
Commercial Loans
Modifications of loans to commercial borrowers experiencing financial difficulty are designed to reduce the Corporation’s loss exposure while providing borrowers with an opportunity to work through financial difficulties, often to avoid foreclosure or bankruptcy. Each modification is unique, reflects the borrower’s individual circumstances and is designed to benefit the borrower while mitigating the Corporation’s risk exposure. Commercial modifications are primarily term extensions and payment forbearances. Payment forbearances involve the Corporation forbearing its contractual right to collect certain payments or payment in full (maturity forbearance) for a defined period of time. Reductions in interest rates and principal forgiveness occur infrequently for commercial borrowers. Principal forgiveness may occur in connection with foreclosure, short sales or other settlement agreements, leading to termination or sale of the loan.
