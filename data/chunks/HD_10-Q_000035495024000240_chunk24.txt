Comparable Sales.
Total comparable sales for the first nine months of fiscal 2024 decreased 2.5%, reflecting a 1.5% decrease in comparable customer transactions and a 1.2% decrease in comparable average ticket compared to the first nine months of fiscal 2023. The decrease in comparable customer transactions primarily reflects the impact of heightened macroeconomic uncertainties and other macroeconomic factors, including the impacts of a persisting high interest rate environment pressuring home improvement demand. The decrease in comparable average ticket primarily reflects price stabilization relative to last year, slightly offset by demand for new and innovative products.
During the first nine months of fiscal 2024, our Power and Building Materials merchandising departments posted positive comparable sales compared to the first nine months of fiscal 2023. All of our other merchandising departments posted negative comparable sales during the first nine months of fiscal 2024 compared to the first nine months of fiscal 2023.
Gross Profit
Gross profit for the first nine months of fiscal 2024 increased 2.1% to $40.3 billion from $39.5 billion for the first nine months of fiscal 2023. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales, or gross profit margin, was 33.6% for the first nine months of fiscal 2024 compared to 33.5% for the first nine months of fiscal 2023.
