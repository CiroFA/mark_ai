Capital Resources
Our principal sources of liquidity are our cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, and cash generated from operations. Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities are comprised of cash on deposit with banks, time deposits, money market funds, U.S. government and agency securities, investment grade corporate debt securities, and marketable equity securities. As part of our cash management strategy, we concentrate cash deposits with large financial institutions and our investment holdings are in diversified highly rated securities. Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $70.23 billion as of March 31, 2025, a decrease of $7.58 billion from December 31, 2024. The decrease was primarily due to our capital returns of $14.08 billion for repurchases of our Class A common stock and payments of dividends and dividend equivalents, $13.69 billion for capital expenditures, including principal payments on finance leases, and $4.88 billion of taxes paid related to net share settlement of employee restricted stock unit (RSU) awards. These decreases were partially offset by $24.03 billion of cash generated from operations.
The following table presents our cash flows (in millions):
Cash Provided by Operating Activities
Cash provided by operating activities during the three months ended March 31, 2025 mostly consisted of $16.64 billion net income adjusted for certain non-cash items, such as $4.15 billion of share-based compensation expense and $3.90 billion of depreciation and amortization expense. The increase in cash flows from operating activities during the three months ended March 31, 2025, compared to the same period in 2024, was due to an increase in cash collection from our customers driven by the increase in revenue, partially offset by higher operational spending.
Cash Used in Investing Activities
Cash used in investing activities during the three months ended March 31, 2025 mostly consisted of $12.94 billion of purchases of property and equipment as we continued to invest in servers, data centers, and network infrastructure, and $6.98 billion of net purchases of marketable securities. The increase in cash used in investing activities during the three months ended March 31, 2025, compared to the same period in 2024, was mostly due to increases in purchases of property and equipment and marketable securities.
We anticipate making capital expenditures of approximately $64 billion to $72 billion in 2025 to support our core business and generative AI efforts.
Cash Used in Financing Activities
Cash used in financing activities during the three months ended March 31, 2025 mostly consisted of $12.75 billion for repurchases of our Class A common stock, $1.33 billion of payments of dividends and dividend equivalents, and $4.88 billion of taxes paid related to net share settlement of RSUs.
