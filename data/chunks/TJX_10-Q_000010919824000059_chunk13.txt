Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Basis of Presentation
The Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) for interim financial information. These Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto are unaudited and, in the opinion of management, reflect all normal recurring adjustments, accruals and deferrals among periods required to match costs properly with the related revenue or activity, considered necessary by The TJX Companies, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, “TJX”) for a fair statement of its Consolidated Financial Statements for the periods reported, all in conformity with GAAP consistently applied. The Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto should be read in conjunction with the audited Consolidated Financial Statements, including the related notes, contained in TJX’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 3, 2024 (“fiscal 2024”).

The February 3, 2024 balance sheet data was derived from audited Consolidated Financial Statements and does not include all disclosures required by GAAP.

Fiscal 2024 was a 53-week fiscal year. “Fiscal 2026” will be a 52-week fiscal year and will end January 31, 2026. “Fiscal 2027” will be a 52-week fiscal year and will end January 30, 2027.
