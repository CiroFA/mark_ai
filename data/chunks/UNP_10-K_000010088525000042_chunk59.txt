Nature of Operations
Operations and Segmentation
– We are a Class I railroad operating in the U.S. Our network includes
32,880
route miles, connecting Pacific Coast and Gulf Coast ports with the Midwest and Eastern U.S. gateways and providing several corridors to key Mexican and Canadian gateways. We own
26,291
miles and operate on the remainder pursuant to trackage rights or leases. We serve the western two-thirds of the country and maintain coordinated schedules with other rail carriers for the handling of freight to and from the Atlantic Coast, the Pacific Coast, the Southeast, the Southwest, Canada, and Mexico. Export and import traffic is moved through Gulf Coast, Pacific Coast, and East Coast ports and across the Mexican and Canadian borders.
The Railroad, along with its subsidiaries and rail affiliates, is our
one
reportable operating segment. Although we provide and analyze revenues by commodity group, we treat the financial results of the Railroad as
one
segment due to the integrated nature of our rail network. The accounting policies of the Railroad segment are the same as those described in Note 2 Significant Accounting Policies.
The Company’s Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM) is our Chief Executive Officer. The CODM assesses performance for our rail network and decides how to allocate resources based on net income as reported on our Consolidated Statements of Income. The measure of segment assets is reported on our Consolidated Statements of Financial
