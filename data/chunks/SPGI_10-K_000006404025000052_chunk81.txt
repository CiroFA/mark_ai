reconciliation of cash flow provided by operating activities, the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure, to free cash flow.
Operating activities
Cash provided by operating activities increased to $5.7 billion in 2024 as compared to $3.7 billion in 2023. The increase is mainly due to higher operating results in 2024, proceeds received from the termination of interest rate swaps in 2024 and higher tax payments in 2023.
Cash provided by operating activities increased to $3.7 billion in 2023 as compared to $2.6 billion in 2022. The increase is mainly due to higher operating results in 2023, higher IHS Markit merger costs in 2022, higher taxes paid on divestitures in 2022 and a grant payment to the S&P Global Foundation in 2022.
The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”) introduced an international tax framework under Pillar Two which includes a global minimum tax of 15%. This framework has been implemented by several jurisdictions, including jurisdictions in which we operate, with effect from January 1, 2024, and many other jurisdictions, including jurisdictions in which we operate, are in the process of implementing it. The effect of enacted Pillar Two taxes has been included in the results disclosed and did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. The Company continues to monitor jurisdictions that are expected to implement Pillar Two in the future, and it is in the process of evaluating the potential impact of the enactment of Pillar Two by such jurisdictions on its consolidated financial statements.
