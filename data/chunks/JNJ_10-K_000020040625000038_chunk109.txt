Restricted share units and performance share units
The Company grants restricted share units which vest over service periods that range from
6
months to
3
years. The Company also grants performance share units, which are paid in shares of Johnson & Johnson Common Stock after the end of a
three-year
performance period. Performance shares were granted with two equally-weighted goals that directly align with or help drive long-term total shareholder return: adjusted operational earnings per share and relative total shareholder return. The number of shares actually earned at the end of the
three-year
period will vary, based only on actual performance, from
0
% to
200
% of the target number of performance share units granted.
A summary of the restricted share units and performance share units activity under the Plans as of December 29, 2024 is presented below:

, $

and $
153.67
in fiscal years 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, using the fair market value at the date of grant. The fair value of restricted share units was discounted for dividends, which are not paid on the restricted share units during the vesting period. The fair value of restricted share units issued was $

million and $
591
million in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

and $

in fiscal years 2024, 2023 and 2022, calculated using the weighted average fair market value for each of the component goals at the date of grant.
The fair values for the earnings per share goals of each performance share unit were estimated on the date of grant using the fair market value of the shares at the time of the award discounted for dividends, which are not paid on the performance share units during the vesting period. The fair value for the relative total shareholder return goal of each performance share unit was estimated on the date of grant using the Monte Carlo valuation model. The fair value of performance share units issued was $
146
million, $
