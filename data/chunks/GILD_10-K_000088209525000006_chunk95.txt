Indefinite-lived assets – IPR&D balance as of December 31, 2024 was comprised of $
1.8
billion related to SG for NSCLC and $
1.1
billion related to bulevirtide.
Amortization Expense
Aggregate amortization expense related to finite-lived intangible assets was $
2.4
billion, $
2.3
billion and $
1.8
billion for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, primarily included in Cost of goods sold on our Consolidated Statements of Operations.
The following table summarizes the estimated future amortization expense associated with our finite-lived intangible assets as of December 31, 2024:
Impairment Assessments
No indicators of impairment were noted for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, except as described in “2024 Impairments”, “2023 Impairments” and “2022 Impairment” below.
In October 2024, we announced plans to voluntarily withdraw the U.S. accelerated approval for Trodelvy for treatment of adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer who have previously received a platinum-containing chemotherapy and either programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) or programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitor. We analyzed the implications of this and determined that it did not have an impact on the carrying amount of our finite-lived intangible asset related to Trodelvy.
The weighted-average discount rates used in our quantitative assessments for IPR&D intangible assets during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, other than for the assessments described below, were
7.25
%,
7.5
% and
7.5
%, respectively.

2024 Impairments
In January 2024, we received data from our Phase 3 EVOKE-01 study of Trodelvy evaluating SG indicating that the study did not meet its primary endpoint of overall survival in previously treated metastatic NSCLC, thus triggering a review for potential impairment of the NSCLC IPR&D intangible asset. Based on our evaluation of the study results and all other data currently available, and in connection with the preparation of the financial statements for the first quarter, we performed an interim impairment test and determined that the revised estimated fair value of the NSCLC IPR&D intangible asset was below its carrying value. As a result, we recognized a partial impairment charge of $
2.4
billion in In-process research and development impairments on our Consolidated Statements of Operations during the first quarter of 2024.
In September 2024, based on discussions with regulators and external opinion leaders and the completed evaluation of the Phase 3 EVOKE-01 study data, we made a strategic decision to discontinue our clinical development program in metastatic NSCLC for Trodelvy in the second-line indication. This decision triggered a review for potential impairment of the NSCLC IPR&D intangible asset. Based on our evaluation, and in connection with the preparation of the financial statements for the third quarter, we performed an interim impairment test and determined that the
