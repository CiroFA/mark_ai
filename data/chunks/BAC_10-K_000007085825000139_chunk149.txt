cyberattacks, and military conflicts or other significant geopolitical events.
Widespread adoption and rapid evolution of, as well as developments in the regulatory landscape relating to  emerging technologies, including analytic capabilities, AI (including machine learning and generative AI), automated decision-making, self-service digital trading platforms and automated trading markets, internet services, and digital assets, such as central bank digital currencies, cryptocurrencies (including stablecoins), tokens and other cryptoassets that utilize distributed ledger technology (DLT), as well as payment, clearing and settlement processes that use DLT, create additional strategic risks, could negatively impact our ability to compete and require substantial expenditures to the extent we were to modify or adapt our existing products and services. As new technologies evolve and mature, our businesses and results of operations could be adversely impacted, including as a result of new competitors to the payments and trading ecosystems and increased volatility in deposits and/or significant long-term reduction in deposits (i.e., financial disintermediation).
Also, we may not be as timely or successful in assessing the competitive landscape and developing or introducing new products and services, integrating new products or services into our existing offerings, responding, managing or adapting to changes in consumer behavior, preferences, spending, investing and/or saving habits, achieving market acceptance of our products and services, reducing costs in response to pressures to deliver products and services at lower prices or sufficiently developing and maintaining clients. Further, our businesses may be negatively impacted if we, or our third-party providers, do not timely development and apply emerging technologies, like AI and quantum computing, or if our initiatives in these areas are deficient or fail. Our or our third-party providersâ€™ inability or resistance to timely innovate or adapt operations, products and services to evolving regulatory and market environments, industry standards and consumer preferences could result in service disruptions, harm our business and adversely affect our results of operations and reputation.
We could suffer operational, reputational and financial harm if our models fail to properly anticipate and manage risk.
We use models enterprise-wide, including to forecast losses, project revenue and expenses, assess and control our operations and financial condition, assist in capital planning, manage liquidity and measure, forecast and assess capital and liquidity requirements for credit, market, operational and strategic risks. Under our Enterprise Model Risk Policy, Model Risk Management is required to perform end-to-end model oversight, including independent validation before initial use, implementation monitoring, ongoing monitoring reviews through outcomes analysis and benchmarking, and periodic revalidation.
