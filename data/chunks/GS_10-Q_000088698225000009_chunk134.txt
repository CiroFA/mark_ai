SUBSIDIARIES
Management’s Discussion and Analysis
Assets Under Supervision.
AUS includes our institutional clients’ assets, assets sourced through third-party distributors and high-net-worth clients’ assets where we earn a fee for managing assets on a discretionary basis. This includes net assets in our mutual funds, hedge funds, credit funds, private equity funds, real estate funds, and separately managed accounts for institutional and individual investors. AUS also includes client assets invested with third-party managers, private bank deposits and advisory relationships where we earn a fee for advisory and other services, but do not have investment discretion. AUS does not include the self-directed brokerage assets of our clients.
The table below presents information about our firmwide period-end AUS by asset class, client channel, region and vehicle.

In addition to our AUS, we have discretion over alternative investments where we currently do not earn management fees (non-fee-earning alternative assets).
We earn management fees on client assets that we manage and also receive incentive fees based on a percentage of a fund’s or a separately managed account’s return, or when the return exceeds a specified benchmark or other performance targets.
