The fair value of each option was estimated on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions:
(1)
Based on Visa’s historical exercise experience.
(2)
Based on the zero-coupon U.S. Treasury constant maturity yield curve, continuously compounded over the expected term of the awards.
(3)
Based on the Company’s implied and historical volatilities.
(4)
Based on the Company’s annual dividend rate on the date of grant.
The following table summarizes the Company’s option activity:
(1)
Calculated using the closing stock price on the last trading day of fiscal 2024 of $
274.95
, less the option exercise price, multiplied by the number of instruments.
(2)
Applied a forfeiture rate to unvested options outstanding as of September 30, 2024 to estimate the options expected to vest in the future.
During fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022, the total intrinsic value of options exercised was $
185
million, $
134
million and $
56
million, respectively, and
the tax benefit realized was $
28
million
, $
28
million and $
11
million, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, there was $
27
million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested options, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately
0.42
year.
Restricted Stock Units
RSUs issued under the EIP primarily vest ratably over
three years
from the date of grant, subject to earlier vesting in full under certain conditions. Upon vesting,
RSUs can be settled in class A common stock on a
one
-for-one basis or in cash, or a combination thereof, at the Company’s option. T
he Company does not currently intend to settle any RSUs in cash. During the vesting period,
RSU award recipients are eligible to receive dividend equivalents,
but do not participate in the voting rights granted to the holders of the underlying class A common stock.
The fair value and compensation cost before estimated forfeitures is calculated using the closing price of class A common stock on the date of grant. During fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022, the weighted-average grant date fair value of RSUs granted was $
253.29
, $
212.94
and $
204.73
, respectively. During fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022, the total grant date fair value of RSUs vested was $
616
million
,
$
486
million and $
380
million, respectively.
