30
days following notice thereof, such other party may terminate the Merger Agreement.
The Merger Agreement also provides that we will be required to pay Spirit a termination fee of $
300
if the Merger Agreement is terminated by Spirit or Boeing under certain specified circumstances as a result of the parties' failure to obtain the required regulatory approvals by the Outside Date or in the event that any law or order related to the required regulatory approvals or any applicable antitrust law or foreign investment law prohibits the consummation of the Merger.
