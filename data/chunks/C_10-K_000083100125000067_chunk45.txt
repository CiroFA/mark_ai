Citi’s net interest income could be adversely affected due to a flattening (a lower spread between shorter-term versus longer-term interest rates) or inversion (shorter-term interest rates exceeding longer-term interest rates) of the interest rate yield curve, as Citi typically pays interest on deposits based on shorter-term interest rates and earns money on loans based on longer-term interest rates. For additional information on Citi’s interest rate risk, see
“Managing Global Risk—Market Risk—Banking Book Interest Rate Risk” below.
Additional areas of uncertainty include, among others, geopolitical challenges, tensions and conflicts, including those related to the Russia–Ukraine war (see below) and conflicts in the Middle East; potential policies and priorities resulting from the new U.S. administration; economic and geopolitical challenges related to China, including weak economic growth, related policy actions, challenges in the Chinese real estate sector, banking and credit markets, trade restrictions, and tensions or conflicts between China and Taiwan and/or China and the U.S.; high and rising government debt levels in the U.S. and other countries; significant volatility and disruptions in financial markets, including foreign currency volatility and devaluations; natural disasters; and pandemics.
For example, the Russia–Ukraine war could have further negative impacts on regional and global energy and other commodities and financial markets and macroeconomic conditions, adversely impacting jurisdictions where Citi operates and its customers, clients or employees. In addition, Citi’s remaining operations in Russia subject Citi to various other risks, including foreign currency volatility, such as appreciations or devaluations; restrictions arising from retaliatory Russian laws and regulations on the conduct of Citi’s remaining businesses, including, without limitation, its provision of certain securities services to customers; sanctions or asset freezes; and other deconsolidation events. For additional information about these Russia-related risks, see the operational processes and systems, cybersecurity and emerging markets risk factors and “Managing Global Risk—Other Risks—Country Risk—Russia” below.
STRATEGIC RISKS
Citi’s Ability to Return Capital to Common Shareholders Substantially Depends on Regulatory Capital Requirements, Including the Results of the CCAR Process and Dodd-Frank Act Regulatory Stress Tests, and Other Factors.
Citi’s ability to return capital to its common shareholders consistent with its capital planning efforts and targets, whether through its common stock dividend or through share repurchases, substantially depends, among other things, on its regulatory capital requirements, including the annual recalibration of the Stress Capital Buffer (SCB), which is based upon the results of the CCAR process required by the FRB, and recalibration of the GSIB surcharge, as well as the supervisory expectations and assessments
