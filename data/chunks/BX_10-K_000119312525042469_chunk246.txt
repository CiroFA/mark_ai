Potential Payments Upon Termination of Employment or Change in Control
Upon a change of control event where any person, other than Blackstone Group Management L.L.C. or a person approved by Blackstone Group Management L.L.C., becomes the Series II Preferred Stockholder or a termination of employment because of death or disability, any unvested deferred restricted Blackstone Holdings Partnership Units or unvested deferred restricted common stock units held by any of our named executive officers will automatically be deemed vested as of immediately prior to such occurrence of such change of control or such termination of employment. Had such a change of control or such a termination of employment occurred on December 31, 2024, the last business day of 2024, each of our continuing named executive officers would have vested in the following numbers of deferred restricted common stock units, having the following values based on our closing market price of $172.42 per share of common stock on December 31, 2024, other than the deferred restricted common stock units granted to Mr. Gray, Mr. Chae, Mr. Finley and Mr. Sawhney in 2025 in respect of 2024 performance, which are valued as of the date of their grant: Mr. Schwarzman had no outstanding unvested equity at December 31, 2024; Mr. Gray —1,561,967 deferred restricted common stock units with an aggregate value of $268,997,917, Mr. Chae —468,845 deferred restricted common stock units with an aggregate value of $80,583,873, Mr. Finley — 372,811 deferred restricted common stock units with an aggregate value of $64,186,295, and Mr. Sawhney —437,999 deferred restricted common stock units with an aggregate value of $75,337,790. In addition, the Bonus Deferral Plan provides that upon a change in control or termination of the participant’s employment because of death, any fully vested but undelivered deferred restricted common stock units will become immediately deliverable.
In connection with a named executive officer’s termination of employment due to a Tier I qualifying retirement, 50% of their unvested discretionary equity awards will continue to vest and be delivered over the vesting period and any unvested deferred restricted common stock
