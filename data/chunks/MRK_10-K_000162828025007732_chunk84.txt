MK-8591A is a once-daily oral combination of doravirine and islatravir, an investigational nucleoside reverse transcriptase translocation inhibitor (NRTTI), being evaluated for the treatment of HIV infection in previously untreated adults and as a switch in antiretroviral therapy in virologically suppressed adults. MK-8591D is an oral once-weekly combination of islatravir and Gilead Sciences Inc.’s lenacapavir being evaluated for the treatment of HIV infection in virologically suppressed adults. In 2021, the FDA placed clinical holds on the islatravir investigational NDAs based on observations of decreases in total lymphocyte and CD4+ T-cell counts in some participants receiving islatravir in clinical studies. The investigational NDAs for the doravirine/islatravir and the islatravir/lenacapavir once-weekly treatment regimens remain under a partial clinical hold for any studies that would use islatravir doses higher than the doses considered for the revised clinical programs.
