and hybrid deployments (an approach that combines both on-premise and cloud-based deployments), such as Oracle Exadata Cloud@Customer and Dedicated Region offerings (instances of Oracle Cloud in a customer’s own data center) and multicloud options that enable customers to use Oracle Cloud in conjunction with other public clouds. Accordingly, we offer choice and flexibility to our customers and facilitate the product, service and deployment combinations that best suit our customers’ needs. Our customers include businesses of many sizes, government agencies, educational institutions and resellers that we market and sell to directly through our worldwide sales force or indirectly through the Oracle Partner Network. Using Oracle technologies, our customers build, deploy, run, manage and support their internal and external products, services and business operations, including, for example, an artificial intelligence (AI) product company that uses Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) to build and serve generative AI models; a global technology company that uses OCI to power its logistics and mobile application offerings; a multinational financial institution that runs its banking applications using Oracle Exadata Cloud@Customer; and a global consumer products company that leverages Oracle Fusion Cloud Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) for its accounting processes, risk management, supply chain and financial planning functions.
Oracle SaaS and OCI (collectively Oracle Cloud Services) offerings provide comprehensive and integrated applications and infrastructure services enabling our customers to choose the best option that meets their specific business needs. Oracle Cloud Services integrate the IT components, including software, hardware and services, in a cloud-based IT environment that Oracle deploys, manages, supports and upgrades for customers and that customers may access utilizing common web browsers via a broad spectrum of devices.
Oracle Cloud Services are designed to be rapidly deployable to enable customers shorter time to innovation; intuitive for casual and experienced users; easily maintainable to reduce upgrade, integration and testing work; connectable among differing deployment models to enable interoperability and extensibility to easily move workloads among the Oracle Cloud and other IT and cloud environments; cost-effective by lowering upfront customer investments and implementing usage-based resource consumption costs; and highly secure, standards-based and reliable.
Oracle cloud license and on-premise license deployment offerings include Oracle Applications, Oracle Database and Oracle Middleware software offerings, among others, which customers deploy using IT infrastructure from the Oracle Cloud or their own cloud-based or on-premise IT environments. Substantially all customers opt to purchase license support contracts when they purchase an Oracle license.
