largely unchanged from
the
same period in 2024,
primarily due to higher revenue, mostly offset by higher noninterest expense. The operating margin was 22 percent compared to 24 percent a year ago.
Net interest income decreased $49 million to $1.8 billion primarily due to the impact of lower interest rates and lower average deposit balances.
Noninterest income, which primarily includes investment and brokerage services income, increased $474 million to $4.3 billion. The increase was primarily due to higher asset management fees driven by higher average equity market valuations and the impact of positive AUM flows.
Noninterest expense increased $395 million to $4.7 billion primarily due to higher revenue-related incentives and investments in the business, including people and technology.
The return on average allocated capital was 21 percent, down from 22 percent, due to an increase in allocated capital. For information on capital allocated to the business segments, see Business Segment Operations on page 8.
