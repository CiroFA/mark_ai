The operation of our businesses and the environment for travel and tourism, as well as demand for and consumption of our other products and services, is subject to adverse impacts from a variety of factors beyond our control in the U.S., globally or in specific geographic regions around the world where we operate, including: health concerns; adverse weather conditions arising from short-term weather patterns or long-term climate change, including longer and more regular excessive heat conditions, catastrophic events or natural disasters (such as excessive heat or rain, hurricanes, typhoons, floods, droughts, tsunamis and earthquakes); international, political or military developments,
