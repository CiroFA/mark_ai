the purchase or consumption of our products. Pandemics, epidemics or other disease outbreaks and geopolitical events and tensions, wars and other military conflicts, including the ongoing conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East, have also impacted and could continue to impact consumer preferences and demand for our products, including negative consumer sentiment toward non-local products. Consumer preferences are also influenced by perception of our brand image or the brand images of our products, the success of our advertising and marketing campaigns, our ability to engage with our consumers in the manner they prefer, including through the use of digital media or assets, and the perception of our use of social media and our response to political and social issues, geopolitical events and tensions, wars and other military conflicts or catastrophic events. These and other factors have reduced and could continue to reduce consumersâ€™ willingness to purchase certain of our products, including as a result of public boycotts. Any inability on our part to anticipate or react to changes in consumer preferences and trends, or make the right strategic investments to do so, including investments in artificial intelligence and data analytics to understand consumer trends, can lead to reduced demand for our products, lead to inventory write-offs or erode our competitive and financial position, thereby adversely affecting our business. In addition, our business operations, including our supply chain, are subject to disruption by geopolitical events and tensions, wars and other military conflicts, natural disasters, pandemics, epidemics or other events beyond our control that could negatively impact product availability and decrease demand for our products if our crisis management plans do not effectively mitigate these issues.
