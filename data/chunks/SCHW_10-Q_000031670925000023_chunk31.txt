Total expenses excluding interest were $3.1 billion in the first quarter of 2025, higher by 7% from the first quarter of 2024. This increase was due primarily to higher compensation and benefits expense, inclusive of annual merit increases and a reduction in the prior year for a change in estimated restructuring costs, and higher other expense which was due to higher industry fees resulting from the SEC’s May 2024 fee rate increase and higher client trading volume.
