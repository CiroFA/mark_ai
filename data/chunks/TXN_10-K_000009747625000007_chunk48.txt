upon repatriation of available cash to the United States. A provision has been made for deferred taxes on these undistributed earnings to the extent that repatriation of the available cash to the United States is expected to result in a tax liability. As of December 31, 2024, we have no basis differences that would result in material unrecognized deferred tax liabilities.

Uncertain tax positions
We operate in a number of tax jurisdictions, and our income tax returns are subject to examination by tax authorities in those jurisdictions who may challenge any item on these tax returns. Because the matters challenged by authorities are typically complex, their ultimate outcome is uncertain. Before any benefit can be recorded in our financial statements, we must determine that it is “more likely than not” that a tax position will be sustained by the appropriate tax authorities. We recognize accrued interest related to uncertain tax positions and penalties as components of OI&E.
The changes in the total amounts of uncertain tax positions are as follows:
The liability for uncertain tax positions is a component of other long-term liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
All of the $
85
million and $
82
million liabilities for uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, are comprised of positions that, if recognized, would lower the effective tax rate. If these liabilities are ultimately realized, no existing deferred tax assets in 2024 or 2023 would also be realized.
