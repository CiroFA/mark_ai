differing interpretations of tax laws and regulations and, as a result, significant disputes may arise with these tax authorities, including with respect to issues of the timing and amount of deductions and allocations of income among various tax jurisdictions. We may be adversely affected by the resolution of one or more of these exposures in any reporting period.

Item 2.    UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS
Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities
In the first quarter of 2020, our Board of Directors authorized a $5.0 billion stock repurchase program (“2020 Program”), with no fixed expiration. Purchases under the 2020 Program may be made in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, but the program does not obligate us to repurchase any specific number of shares and may be amended, suspended or discontinued at any time. We started repurchases under the 2020 Program in December 2022.
The table below summarizes our stock repurchase activity for the three months ended March 31, 2025:
_______________________________
(1)
The difference between the total number of shares purchased and the total number of shares purchased as part of a publicly announced program is due to shares of common stock withheld by us from employee restricted stock awards in order to satisfy applicable tax withholding obligations.
