insurance activities. Certain regulators prefer close relationships with all subject insurers and others operate a risk-based approach.
Chubb operates in some countries through subsidiaries and in some countries through branches of subsidiaries. Local capital requirements applicable to a subsidiary generally include its branches. Certain Chubb companies are jointly owned with local companies to comply with legal requirements for local ownership. Other legal requirements include discretionary licensing procedures, compulsory cessions of reinsurance, local retention of funds and records, data privacy and protection program requirements such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and foreign exchange controls. Chubb's international companies are also subject to multinational application of certain U.S. laws.
There are various regulatory bodies and initiatives that impact Chubb in multiple international jurisdictions and the potential for significant impact on Chubb could be heightened as a result of recent industry and economic developments.

which encompasses climate risk, that is integrated into management of our businesses and is led by Chubb's senior management. As a result, ERM is a part of the day-to-day management of Chubb and its operations.
Our global ERM framework is broadly multi-disciplinary and its strategic objectives include:
•
External Risks
: identify, analyze, quantify, and where possible, mitigate significant external risks that could materially hamper the financial condition of Chubb and/or the achievement of corporate business objectives over the next 36 months;
•
Exposure Accumulations
: identify and quantify the accumulation of exposure to individual counterparties, products or industry sectors

particularly those that materially extend across or correlate between business units or divisions and/or the balance sheet;
•
Risk Modeling
: develop and use various data-sets, advanced analytics, metrics and processes (such as probabilistic exposure and economic capital models to assess aggregation risk from natural and other catastrophes) that help business and corporate leaders make informed underwriting, portfolio management, and risk management decisions within a consistent risk/reward framework;
•
Governance
:
•
establish and coordinate risk guidelines that reflect the corporate appetite for risk;
•
monitor exposure accumulations relative to established guidelines; and
•
ensure effective internal risk management communication up to management and the Board (including our Risk & Finance Committee), down to the various business units and legal entities, and across the firm; and
•
Disclosure
: develop protocols and processes for
