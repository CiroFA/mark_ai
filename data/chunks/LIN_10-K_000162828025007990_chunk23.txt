On an adjusted basis, depreciation and amortization expense increased $32 million, or 1%, versus 2023. Currency impacts decreased depreciation and amortization by $17 million in 2024. Excluding currency, underlying depreciation and amortization increased due to the net impact of new project start ups.

Interest expense - net
Reported interest expense – net in 2024 increased $56 million, or 28%, versus 2023. The increase was driven primarily by higher outstanding borrowings due to net issuances in 2024 and higher interest rates on borrowings.
Net pension and OPEB cost (benefit), excluding service cost
Reported net pension and OPEB cost (benefit), excluding service cost were benefits of $190 million and $164 million in 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase was driven primarily by a higher expected return on assets and lower interest cost due to decrease in benefit obligations, partially offset by lower amortization of deferred gains year-over-year.
