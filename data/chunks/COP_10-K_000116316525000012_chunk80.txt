Our debt balance at December 31, 2024 was $24.3 billion compared with $18.9 billion at December 31, 2023. The current portion of debt, including payments for finance leases, is $1.0 billion. In 2024, the company retired $726 million principal amount of Notes at maturity consisting of $265 million of our 3.35% Notes and $461 million of our 2.125% Notes. In addition, we completed concurrent debt transactions consisting of new long-term debt issuances of $5.2 billion; a $4.1 billion repurchase of certain existing Marathon Oil and ConocoPhillips debt (with priority for Marathon Oil debt assumed); a non-cash obligor exchange offer to retire $0.9 billion of Marathon Oil debt in exchange for new ConocoPhillips debt; and remarketing of $0.4 billion in available municipal bonds. The debt transactions simplified our capital structure, extended the debt portfolio's weighted average maturity, lowered its weighted average coupon and reduced near-term maturities.

In 2022, we repurchased notes, retired floating rate debt and executed a debt refinancing comprised of concurrent transactions including new debt issuances, a cash tender offer and debt exchange offers.

In 2022, we refinanced our revolving credit facility from a total aggregate principal amount of $6.0 billion to $5.5 billion with an expiration date of February 2027. Our revolving credit facility may be used for direct bank borrowings, the issuance of letters of credit totaling up to $500 million, or as support for our commercial paper program. The revolving credit facility is broadly syndicated among financial institutions and does not contain any material adverse change provisions or any covenants requiring maintenance of specified financial ratios or credit ratings. The facility agreement contains a cross-default provision relating to the failure to pay principal or interest on other debt obligations of $200 million or more by ConocoPhillips, or any of its consolidated subsidiaries. The amount of the facility is not subject to redetermination prior to its expiration date.
Credit facility borrowings may bear interest at a margin above the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR). The agreement calls for commitment fees on available, but unused, amounts. The agreement also contains early termination rights if our current directors or their approved successors cease to be a majority of the
