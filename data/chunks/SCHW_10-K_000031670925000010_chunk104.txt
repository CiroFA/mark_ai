increased $240 million, or 2%, in 2024 from 2023 and $643 million, or 6%, in 2023 from 2022. See Non-GAAP Financial Measures for further details and a reconciliation of such measures to GAAP reported results. The overall decrease in expenses in 2024 reflected lower restructuring costs and lower acquisition and integration-related costs, as substantially all costs related to the Company’s restructuring were incurred in 2023, and spending for the Ameritrade integration decreased in 2024 as we completed final integration activities. We currently anticipate total expenses excluding interest in full-year 2025 will increase approximately 3.5% to 4.5% from 2024, and adjusted total expenses in full-year 2025 will increase approximately 4.5% to 5.5%.

THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)
Total compensation and benefits decreased in 2024 from 2023 primarily due to restructuring costs recognized in 2023, as well as lower headcount as a result of position eliminations from the restructuring and Ameritrade integration. These decreases were partially offset by higher incentive compensation and annual merit increases. The 2023 increase was a result of restructuring costs recognized during the second half of 2023 related to position eliminations, higher average employee headcount to support Ameritrade client account transitions, and annual merit increases, partially offset by lower incentive compensation. Compensation and benefits included acquisition and integration-related costs of $54 million, $187 million, and $220 million in 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. Compensation and benefits also included a $34 million benefit in 2024, due to a change in estimated restructuring costs, and included restructuring costs of $292 million in 2023
.
Professional services expense remained consistent in 2024 compared to 2023. The increase in 2023 from 2022 was primarily due to increased utilization of professional services to support overall growth of the business. Professional services included acquisition and integration-related costs of $36 million, $135 million, and $140 million in 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.
Occupancy and equipment expense decreased in 2024 from 2023, due to lower technology equipment and software costs, lower property tax expense, and lower occupancy costs as a result of facility closures in 2023 related to restructuring and the Ameritrade integration. The increase in 2023 from 2022 was primarily due to an increase in software maintenance and other agreements as well as other technology equipment costs to support growth of the business and the integration of Ameritrade. Occupancy and equipment included restructuring costs of $5 million and $17 million in 2024 and 2023, respectively, and acquisition and integration-related costs of $28 million and $21 million in 2023
