We consider highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. In all periods presented, cash equivalents consist primarily of money market funds. Investments consist primarily of investment-grade available-for-sale debt securities. Funds receivable and amounts held for customers represent funds receivable from third-party payment processors for customer transactions, funds in transit to our customers, and funds held on behalf of our customers that are invested in cash and cash equivalents and investment-grade available-for-sale securities, restricted for use solely for the purpose of satisfying amounts we owe on behalf of our customers. Our obligations with respect to funds we transmit on behalf of our customers are satisfied when the funds are settled in the customers' accounts.
