The following table sets forth our operating measure ARPA:
Postpaid ARPA increased $5.34, or 4%, primarily from:
•
An increase in customers per account, including from the continued adoption of High Speed Internet;
•
Higher premium services, primarily high-end rate plans, net of contra-revenues for content included in such plans, and discounts for specific affinity groups, such as 55+, military and first responders; and
•
The positive impact from prior year rate plan optimizations; partially offset by
•
Increased promotional activity; and

An increase in total High Speed Internet only accounts.
Average Revenue Per User
Average Revenue per User (“ARPU”) represents the average monthly service revenue earned per customer. ARPU is calculated as service revenues for the specified period divided by the average number of customers during the period, further divided by the number of months in the period. We believe ARPU provides management, investors and analysts with useful information to assess and evaluate our service revenue per customer and assist in forecasting our future service revenues generated from our customer base. Postpaid phone ARPU excludes postpaid other customers and related revenues, which include High Speed Internet, mobile internet devices (including tablets and hotspots), wearables, DIGITS and other connected devices (including SyncUP and IoT).
The following table sets forth our operating measure ARPU:
Postpaid Phone ARPU
Postpaid phone ARPU increased $0.59, or 1%, primarily from:
•
Higher premium services, primarily high-end rate plans, net of contra-revenues for content included in such plans, and discounts for specific affinity groups, such as 55+, military and first responders; and
•
The positive impact from prior year rate plan optimizations; partially offset by
•
Increased promotional activity, including the success of bundled offerings and continued growth in T-Mobile for Business customers with lower ARPU given large account sizes.
Prepaid ARPU
Prepaid ARPU decreased $2.51, or 7%, primarily from the inclusion of prepaid customers with lower ARPU associated with the Ka’ena Acquisition.
