Unfavorable changes in immigration or travel policies could adversely affect JPMorganChase’s businesses and operations.
JPMorganChase relies on the skills, knowledge and expertise of employees located throughout the world. Changes in immigration or travel policies in the U.S. and other countries that unduly restrict or otherwise make it more difficult for employees or their family members to work in, or travel to or transfer between, jurisdictions in which JPMorganChase has operations or conducts its business could inhibit JPMorganChase’s ability to attract and retain qualified employees, and thereby dilute the quality of its workforce, or could prompt JPMorganChase to make structural changes to its worldwide or regional operating models that cause its operations to be less efficient or more costly.
Legal
JPMorganChase faces significant legal risks from litigation and formal and informal regulatory and government investigations.
JPMorganChase is named as a defendant or is otherwise involved in many legal proceedings, including class actions, derivative actions and other litigation or disputes with third parties, as well as criminal proceedings. Actions currently pending against JPMorganChase may result in judgments, settlements, fines, penalties or other sanctions adverse to JPMorganChase. Any of these matters could materially and adversely affect JPMorganChase’s business, financial condition or results of operations, or cause serious reputational harm. As a participant in the financial services industry, it is likely that JPMorganChase will continue to experience a high level of litigation and regulatory and government investigations related to its businesses and operations.
Regulators and other government agencies conduct examinations of JPMorganChase and its subsidiaries both on a routine basis and in targeted exams, and JPMorganChase’s businesses and operations are subject to heightened regulatory oversight. This heightened regulatory scrutiny, or the results of such an investigation or examination, may lead to additional regulatory investigations or enforcement actions. There is no assurance that those actions will not result in resolutions or other enforcement actions against JPMorganChase. Furthermore, a single event involving a potential violation of law or regulation may give rise to numerous and overlapping investigations and proceedings, either by multiple federal, state or local agencies and officials in the U.S. or, in some instances, regulators and other governmental officials in non-U.S. jurisdictions.
In addition, if another financial institution violates a law or regulation relating to a particular business activity or practice, this will often give rise to an investigation by regulators and other governmental agencies of the same or similar activity or practice by JPMorganChase.
JPMorganChase could become subject to a significant regulatory investigation and be unable to disclose specific information concerning that
