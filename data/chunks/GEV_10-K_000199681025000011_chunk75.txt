Separation and Distribution Agreement, and Delaware law may
discourage takeovers and limit the power of our stockholders.
Several provisions of our certificate of incorporation, bylaws, the
Separation and Distribution Agreement, and Delaware law may discourage, delay, or prevent a merger or acquisition. These include,
among others, provisions that (i) classify our board of directors until 2029 whereby not all members are elected at one time, which could
delay the ability of stockholders to change the membership of a majority of our board of directors; (ii) provide for the removal of directors
only for cause during the time the Board is classified; (iii) establish advance notice requirements for stockholder nominations and
proposals; (iv) limit the ability of stockholders to call special meetings or act by written consent; (v) provide the Board the right to issue
shares of preferred stock without stockholder approval; and (vi) provide for the ability of our directors, and not stockholders, to fill vacancies
on the Board (including those resulting from an enlargement of the Board). We are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General
Corporation Law (DGCL), which could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control that
our stockholders
may favor. In
addition, we are subject to the restrictions on change of control transactions under the Separation and Distribution Agreement described
under “Certain Relationships and Related Person Transactions—Agreements with GE—Separation and Distribution Agreement—Credit
Support” in the Information Statement.
These and other provisions of our certificate of incorporation, bylaws, the Separation and Distribution Agreement, and Delaware law, as
well as the restrictions in our Tax Matters Agreement (see “Certain Relationships and Related Person Transactions—Agreements with GE
—Tax Matters Agreement” in the Information Statement), may discourage, delay, or prevent certain types of transactions involving an actual
or a threatened acquisition or change in control of GE Vernova, including unsolicited takeover attempts, even though the transaction may
offer our stockholders the opportunity to sell their shares of our common stock at a price above the prevailing market price. Our Board
believes these provisions will protect our stockholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics by requiring potential acquirers to
negotiate with the Board and by providing the Board with more time to assess any acquisition proposal.
Our certificate of incorporation provides that certain courts in the State of Delaware or the federal district courts of the U.S. will
be the sole and exclusive forum for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our
stockholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or employees.
Our
certificate of incorporation provides that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative
