excluding currency and acquisitions/divestitures, increased by 18.7%, mainly reflecting: the same factors as for net revenues and a favorable comparison to 2024 reflecting restructuring charge in 2024; partly offset by higher marketing, administration and research costs and higher amortization of intangibles in 2025.
Interest expense, net, of $241 million decreased by $58 million or 19.4%, primarily due to a favorable mark-to-market adjustment related to derivative financial instruments and a lower average debt level.
Our effective tax rate decreased by 4.8 percentage points to 20.0%. We estimate that our 2025 effective tax rate will be approximately 22.5% to 23.5%, excluding discrete tax events.  For further details, see Note 10.

.
Net earnings attributable to PMI of $2.7 billion increased by $0.5 billion or 25.2%.  This increase was due primarily to higher operating income, a lower effective tax rate and lower interest expense, net, as discussed above. Basic and diluted EPS of $1.72 increased by 24.6%. Excluding an unfavorable currency impact of $0.07, diluted EPS increased by 29.7%.
Operating Results by Business Segment
Segment Operating Results – Three Months Ended March 31, 2025
The following discussion compares operating results within each of our segments for the three months ended March 31, 2025, with the three months ended March 31, 2024.

During the quarter, net revenues increased by 3.0%. Net revenues, excluding currency and acquisitions/divestitures, increased by 8.6%, reflecting a favorable pricing variance, mainly driven by higher combustible tobacco pricing; and favorable volume/mix, mainly driven by higher smoke-free products volume.
The pricing variance for 2024 and 2025 was negatively impacted by the supplemental tax surcharge on heated tobacco products ("HTPs") in Germany, which went into effect in 2022. On March 14, 2024, the Court of Justice of the European Union (the "CJEU") ruled that the German fiscal regulation imposing an additional excise tax on HTPs does not contravene EU law. On May 15, 2024, following the decision issued by CJEU, the Fiscal Court in Dusseldorf (the "FCD") also ruled that the German fiscal regulation imposing an additional excise tax on HTPs does not contravene EU law. The FCD admitted an appeal to the Federal Tax Court. On June 19, 2024, PMI submitted an appeal. The negative impact will continue, at least until the appeal ruling on the legality of the surcharge is concluded. PMI currently accounts for the surcharge as a reduction in net revenues, with amounts withdrawn before May 15, 2024, currently under a payment suspension. Despite this payment suspension and, in

order to avoid the future addition of interest, PMI elected, on January 14, 2025, to pay the amount outstanding of EUR 721 million (approximately $751 million), excluding accrued interest. An unfavorable outcome to the appeal would negatively impact PMI’s future cash provided by operating
