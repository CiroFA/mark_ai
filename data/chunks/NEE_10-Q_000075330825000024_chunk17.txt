independent system operators, may be posted in the form of cash or credit support in the normal course of business. At March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, applicable NEE subsidiaries have posted approximately $

million (

1,419
million (

at FPL) and $
1,334
million (

at FPL), respectively, in the form of letters of credit and surety bonds, each of which could be applied toward the collateral requirements described above. FPL and NEECH have capacity under their credit facilities generally in excess of the collateral requirements described above that would be available to support, among other things, derivative activities. Under the terms of the credit facilities, maintenance of a specific credit rating is not a condition to drawing on these credit facilities, although there are other conditions to drawing on these credit facilities.
Additionally, some contracts contain certain adequate assurance provisions whereby a counterparty may demand additional collateral based on subjective events and/or conditions. Due to the subjective nature of these provisions, NEE and FPL are unable to determine an exact value for these items and they are not included in any of the quantitative disclosures above.

Non-Derivative Fair Value Measurements
Non-derivative fair value measurements consist of NEE’s and FPL’s cash equivalents and restricted cash equivalents, special use funds and other investments. The fair value of these financial assets is determined by using the valuation techniques and inputs as described in Note 2 – Fair Value Measurements of Derivative Instruments as well as below.
Cash Equivalents
and Restricted Cash Equivalents
– NEE and FPL hold investments primarily in money market funds. The fair value of these funds is estimated using a market approach based on current observable market prices.
Special Use Funds and Other Investments
– NEE and FPL hold primarily debt and equity securities directly, as well as indirectly through commingled funds. Substantially all directly held equity securities are valued at their quoted market prices. For directly held debt securities, multiple prices and price types are obtained from pricing vendors whenever possible, which enables cross-provider validations. A primary price source is identified based on asset type, class or issue of each security. Commingled funds, which are similar to mutual funds, are maintained by banks or investment companies and hold certain investments in accordance with a stated set of objectives. The fair value of commingled funds is primarily derived from the quoted prices in active markets of the underlying securities. Because the fund shares are offered to a limited group of investors, they are not considered to be traded in an active market.

NEE holds investments in equity securities without readily determinable fair values, which are initially recorded at
