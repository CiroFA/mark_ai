derivatives, cash collateral or direct holdings of the referenced assets. This risk mitigation activity is not captured in the table above.
Credit Risk-Related Contingent Features in Derivatives
Certain derivative instruments contain provisions that require the Company to either post additional collateral or immediately settle any outstanding liability balances upon the occurrence of a specified event related to the credit risk of the Company. These events, which are defined by the existing derivative contracts, are primarily downgrades in the credit ratings of the Company and its affiliates.
The fair value (excluding CVA) of all derivative instruments with credit risk-related contingent features that were in a net liability position at December 31, 2024 and 2023 was
$
15
billion
and $
15
billion, respectively. The Company posted
$
13
billion
and $
12
billion as collateral for this exposure in the normal course of business as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
A downgrade could trigger additional collateral or cash settlement requirements for the Company and certain affiliates. In the event that Citigroup and Citibank were downgraded a single notch by all
three
major rating agencies as of December 31, 2024, the Company could be required to post an additional
$
0.2
billion
as either collateral or settlement of the derivative transactions. In addition, the Company could be required to segregate with third-party custodians collateral previously received from existing derivative counterparties in an amount of less than $
1
million upon the single notch downgrade, resulting in aggregate cash obligations and collateral requirements of approximately
$
0.2
billion
.
Derivatives Accompanied by Financial Asset Transfers
The Company executes total return swaps that provide it with synthetic exposure to substantially all of the economic return of the securities or other financial assets referenced in the contract. In certain cases, the derivative transaction is accompanied by the Company’s transfer of the referenced financial asset to the derivative counterparty, most typically in response to the derivative counterparty’s desire to hedge, in whole or in part, its synthetic exposure under the derivative contract by holding the referenced asset in funded form. In certain jurisdictions these transactions qualify as sales, resulting in derecognition of the securities transferred (see Note 1 for further discussion of the related sale conditions for transfers of financial assets). For a significant portion of the transactions, the Company has also executed another total return swap where the Company passes on substantially all of the economic return of the referenced securities to a different third party seeking the exposure. In those cases, the Company is not exposed, on a net basis, to changes in the economic return of the referenced securities.
These transactions generally involve the transfer of the Company’s liquid government bonds, convertible
