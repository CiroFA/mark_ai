track material. Depreciation expense was up 3% for the first quarter of 2025 compared to 2024, driven by a higher depreciable asset base.
Fuel
– Fuel includes locomotive fuel and gasoline for highway and non-highway vehicles and heavy equipment. Fuel expense decreased in the first quarter of 2025 compared to the same period in 2024 driven by a decrease in locomotive diesel fuel prices and a 1% improvement in the fuel consumption rate (computed as gallons of fuel consumed divided by gross ton-miles

in thousands), partially offset by an increase in gross ton-miles. Locomotive diesel fuel prices averaged $2.51 and $2.81 per gallon (including taxes and transportation costs) in the first quarter of 2025 and 2024, respectively.
Equipment and other rents
– Equipment and other rents expense primarily includes rental expense that the Railroad pays for freight cars owned by other railroads or private companies; freight car, intermodal, and locomotive leases; and office and other rent expense, offset by equity income from certain equity method investments. Equipment and other rents expense increased 12% in the first quarter of 2025 compared to 2024, driven by increased car hire for auto racks, inflation, and increased demand in business (mainly intermodal) utilizing freight cars owned by others, partially offset by a reduction in equipment leases.
Other
– Other expense includes state and local taxes; freight, equipment, and property damage; utilities; insurance; personal injury; environmental remediation; employee travel; telephone and cellular; computer software; bad debt; and other general expenses. Other expense increased 1% in the first quarter of 2025 compared to 2024, driven by higher costs associated with destroyed equipment, partially offset by lower bad debt expense and environmental remediation costs.
Other income, net

Interest expense
– Interest expense decreased in the first quarter of 2025 compared to 2024 due to a decreased weighted-average debt level of $31.9 billion in 2025 compared to $32.3 billion in 2024, partially offset by a slightly higher effective interest rate of 4.1% in 2025 compared to 4.0% in 2024.
