issued in June 2023 for the first trial in which the jury found PacifiCorp’s conduct grossly negligent, reckless and willful as to each of the
17
named plaintiffs and the entire class, and the first two damages phase trials for which the verdicts were issued in January and March 2024. The limited judgments award aggregate damages of $
210
million, including $
32
million of doubled economic damages, $
147
million of noneconomic damages and $
41
million of punitive damages based on a
0.25
multiplier applied to economic and noneconomic damages, partially offset by insurance proceeds received by plaintiffs. For each limited judgment entered in the court, PacifiCorp posted a supersedeas bond, which stays any effort to seek payment of the judgments pending final resolution of any appeals. Under Oregon Revised Statutes 82.010, interest at a rate of
9
% per annum will accrue on the judgments commencing at the date the judgments were entered until the entire money award is paid, amended or reversed by an appellate court. In January 2024, PacifiCorp filed a notice of appeal associated with the June 2023 verdict in the
James
case, including whether the case can proceed as a class action and filed a motion to stay further damages phase trials. PacifiCorp amended its appeal of the June 2023
James
verdict to include both the January and March 2024 jury verdicts. The appeals process and further actions could take several years.
In February and March 2025, the juries for the third and fourth
James
damages phase trials awarded
fifteen
plaintiffs $
66
million of noneconomic damages in addition to over $
6
million of economic damages. PacifiCorp expects the court will award the doubling of economic damages to $
13
million and increase the awards for $
18
million in punitive damages consistent with the June 2023
James
verdict. As a result, PacifiCorp expects the total awards for the
fifteen
plaintiffs to be approximately $
97
million. PacifiCorp filed post-trial motions with the Multnomah Court requesting the court offset the damage awards by deducting insurance proceeds received by any of the plaintiffs. PacifiCorp intends to appeal the jury’s damage awards associated with the February and March 2025 jury verdicts once judgments are entered.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
Note 22. Contingencies and commitments
In October 2024, the Multnomah Court issued a case management order, which sets forth
nine
additional damages phase trials with up to
ten
plaintiffs per trial. The trials are scheduled to occur throughout 2025, with the verdicts for the first trials received in February and March 2025, as described above. A hearing is scheduled for May 9, 2025, to evaluate scheduling additional damages phase trials in 2026. On March 20, 2025, PacifiCorp filed a motion to stay the remaining
James
damages phase trials in consideration of the ODF’s Report. The motion was heard by the court and was denied on April 18, 2025.
On April 1, 2025, PacifiCorp filed its
