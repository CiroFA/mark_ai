considers potential changes in
AOCI
(and the corresponding impact on the CET1 Capital ratio) relative to Citi’s capital generation capacity.
Citi uses 100 basis point (bps) shocks in each scenario to reflect its net interest income sensitivity to unanticipated changes in market interest rates, as potential monetary policy decisions and changes in economic conditions may be reflected in current market-implied forward rates.
The following table presents the 12-month estimated impact to Citi’s net interest income,
AOCI
and the CET1 Capital ratio, each assuming an unanticipated parallel instantaneous 100 bps increase in interest rates:
(1)
Excludes trading book and fair value option banking book portfolios and replaces them with the associated transfer pricing.
(2)
Includes the effect of changes in interest rates on
AOCI
related to investment securities, cash flow hedges and pension liability adjustments.
(3)
Excludes the effect of changes in interest rates on
AOCI
related to cash flow hedges, as those changes are excluded from CET1 Capital.
As presented in the table above, Citi’s balance sheet is asset sensitive (assets reprice faster than liabilities), resulting in higher net interest income in increasing interest rate scenarios. The estimated impact to Citi’s net interest income in a 100 bps upward rate shock scenario as of December 31, 2024 remained relatively stable year-over-year. At progressively higher interest rate levels, the marginal net interest income benefit is lower, as Citi assumes it will pass on a larger share of rate changes to depositors (i.e., higher betas), further reducing Citi’s IRE sensitivity. Currency-specific interest rate changes and balance sheet factors may drive quarter-to-quarter volatility in Citi’s estimated IRE for a 100 bps upward rate shock.
All other currencies of $1.1 billion as of December 31, 2024 in the table above includes the impact from the following top five non-U.S. dollar currencies by absolute size: approximately $(0.2) billion from the euro, $0.2 billion from the British pound sterling, and approximately $0.1 billion each from the Chinese yuan, Swiss franc and Indian rupee. The remaining impact is spread across more than 30 additional currencies.
In a 100 bps upward rate shock scenario, Citi expects that the approximate $1.0 billion initial negative impact to
AOCI
could potentially be offset in shareholders’ equity through the expected recovery of the impact on
AOCI
through accretion of Citi’s investment portfolio and expected net interest income benefit over a period of approximately six months.

Scenario Analysis
The following table presents the estimated impact to Citi’s net interest income and
AOCI
under eight different interest rate scenarios for the U.S. dollar and all other currencies in which Citi has invested capital as of December 31, 2024. The 100 bps and 200 bps downward rate scenarios potentially may be impacted by the low level of interest rates in several countries and the
