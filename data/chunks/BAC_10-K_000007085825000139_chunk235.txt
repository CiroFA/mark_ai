scenario depend on a variety of factors including recent economic events, leading economic indicators, views of internal as well as third-party economists and industry trends. Also included in the allowance for loan and lease losses are qualitative reserves to cover losses that are expected but, in the Corporation's assessment, may not be adequately reflected in the quantitative methods or the economic assumptions. Factors that the Corporation considers include changes in lending policies and procedures, business conditions, the nature and size of the portfolio, portfolio concentrations, the volume and severity of past due loans and nonaccrual loans, the effect of external factors such as competition, and legal and regulatory requirements, among others. Further, the Corporation considers the inherent uncertainty in quantitative models that are built on historical data.
The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the allowance for loan and lease losses for the commercial and consumer card portfolios is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment and estimation by management in developing lifetime economic forecast scenarios and related weightings to each scenario, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and in evaluating audit evidence obtained, and (ii) the audit effort involved professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.
Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the allowance for loan and lease losses, including controls over the evaluation and approval of models, forecast scenarios and related weightings, and qualitative reserves. These procedures also included, among others, testing management’s process for estimating the allowance for loan and lease losses, including (i) evaluating the appropriateness of the loss forecast models and methodology, (ii) evaluating the reasonableness of certain macroeconomic variables, (iii) evaluating the reasonableness of management’s development, selection and weighting of lifetime economic forecast scenarios used in the loss forecast models, (iv) testing the completeness and accuracy of data used in the estimate, and (v) evaluating the reasonableness of certain qualitative reserves made to the model output results to determine the overall allowance for loan and lease losses. The procedures also included the involvement of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in evaluating the appropriateness of certain loss forecast models, the reasonableness of economic forecast scenarios
and related weightings and the reasonableness of certain qualitative reserves.
