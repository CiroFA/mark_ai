Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
March 31, 2025
(Unaudited)
Note 1 — Basis of Presentation
The accompanying unaudited, condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared pursuant to rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and, therefore, do not include all information and footnote disclosures normally included in audited financial statements. However, in the opinion of management, all adjustments (which include only normal adjustments) necessary to present fairly the results of operations, financial position and cash flows have been made. It is suggested that these statements be read in conjunction with the financial statements included in Abbott’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024. The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the parent company and subsidiaries, after elimination of intercompany transactions.
Note 2 — New Accounting Standards
Recently Adopted Accounting Standards
In November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2023-07,
Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures
, which expands the breadth and frequency of required segment disclosures. The guidance is required to be applied retrospectively to all periods presented in the financial statements. Abbott adopted the standard on January 1, 2024. The new standard did not have an impact on Abbott's consolidated financial statements, but required additional disclosures, retrospectively applied to all periods presented in Note 14 — Segment and geographic area information.
