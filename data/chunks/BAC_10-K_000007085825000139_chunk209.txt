Net charge-offs for 2024 were $6.0 billion compared to $3.8 billion in 2023 primarily due to credit card loans and the commercial real estate office portfolio. The provision for credit losses increased $1.4 billion to $5.8 billion during 2024 compared to 2023. The provision for credit losses in 2024 was primarily driven by credit card as well as small business loan growth, and asset quality deterioration in the commercial real estate office and credit card portfolios. The provision for credit losses for the consumer portfolio, including unfunded lending commitments, decreased $267 million to $4.3 billion during 2024 compared to 2023. The provision for credit losses for the
