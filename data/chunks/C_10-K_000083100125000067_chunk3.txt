For more information on TCE, RoTCE and TBVPS, see “Capital Resources—Tangible Common Equity, Book Value Per Share, Tangible Book Value Per Share and Return on Equity” below. TCE, RoTCE and TBVPS are used by management, as well as investors, industry analysts and others, in assessing Citi’s use of equity. Citi believes TCE and RoTCE are useful to investors, industry analysts and others by providing alternative measures of capital strength and performance. Citi believes TBVPS provides additional useful information about the level of tangible assets in relation to Citi’s outstanding shares of common stock.
For more information on non-
Markets
net interest income, see “Market Risk—Non-
Markets
Net Interest Income” below.
Management uses non-
Markets
net interest income to assess the performance of Citi’s lending, investing (including asset-liability management) and deposit-raising activities, apart from any volatility associated with
Markets
activities. Citi believes the use of this non-GAAP measure provides investors, industry analysts and others with an alternative measure to analyze the net interest income trends of Citi’s lending, investing and deposit-raising activities, by providing a meaningful depiction of the underlying fundamentals of period-to-period operating results of those activities; improved visibility into management decisions and their impacts on operational performance; and additional comparability to peer companies.
