alternative sources of financing, if necessary.
Our material cash requirements include contractual and other obligations arising in the normal course of business. These obligations primarily include long-term debt and related interest payments, operating and finance lease obligations, and purchase obligations. In addition to our cash requirements, we follow a disciplined approach to capital allocation. This approach first prioritizes investing in the business, followed by paying dividends, with the intent of then returning excess cash to shareholders in the form of share repurchases. In March 2024, we paused share repurchases in anticipation of the acquisition of SRS and do not have plans to resume share repurchases in fiscal 2025.

During fiscal 2024, we invested approximately $3.5 billion back into our business in the form of capital expenditures.  In line with our expectation of approximately 2.5% of fiscal 2025 net sales, we plan to invest approximately $4 billion back into our business in the form of capital expenditures in fiscal 2025, with investments across initiatives to improve the customer experience, including through technology and development of other differentiated capabilities, to continue to mature and build out Pro capabilities, as well as to build new stores. However, we may adjust our capital expenditures to support the operations of the business, to enhance long-term strategic positioning, or in response to the economic environment, as necessary or appropriate. We may also utilize strategic acquisitions to help accelerate our strategic initiatives.
During fiscal 2024, we paid cash dividends of $8.9 billion to shareholders. In February 2025, we announced a 2.2% increase in our quarterly cash dividend from $2.25 to $2.30 per share. We intend to pay a dividend in the future; however, any future dividend is subject to declaration by our Board based on our earnings, capital requirements, financial condition, and other factors considered relevant by our Board.
In August 2023, our Board approved a $15.0 billion share repurchase authorization that replaced the previous authorization of $15.0 billion, which was approved in August 2022. The August 2023 authorization does not have a prescribed expiration date. As of February 2, 2025, approximately $11.7 billion of the $15.0 billion share repurchase authorization remained available. During fiscal 2024, we made cash payments of $649 million for repurchases of our common stock through open market purchases, prior to pausing share repurchases in March 2024 as discussed above.

At the beginning of fiscal 2024, we had a commercial paper program that allowed for an aggregate of $5.0 billion in borrowings. In connection with our program, we had back-up credit facilities with a consortium of banks for an aggregate of $5.0 billion in borrowings, which consisted of a five-year $3.5 billion credit facility scheduled to expire in July 2027 and a 364-day $1.5 billion credit
