operating our business. We
incorporate
cybersecurity practices into our Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) program. Management is responsible for assessing and managing risk, including through the ERM program, subject to oversight by our BOD. Our cybersecurity policies and practices are aligned with NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) industry standards.
Consistent with our overall ERM program and practices, our cybersecurity program includes:
•
Vigilance
: We maintain a global cybersecurity operation that endeavors to detect, prevent, contain, and respond to cybersecurity threats and incidents in a prompt and effective manner with the goal of minimizing business disruptions.
•
External Collaboration
: We collaborate with public and private entities, including intelligence and law enforcement agencies, industry groups and third-party service providers to identify, assess and mitigate cybersecurity risks.
•
Systems Safeguards
: We deploy technical safeguards that are designed to protect our information systems, products, operations and sensitive information from cybersecurity threats. These include firewalls, intrusion prevention and detection systems, disaster recovery capabilities, malware and ransomware prevention, access controls and data protection. We continuously conduct vulnerability assessments to identify new risks and periodically test the efficacy of our safeguards through both internal and external penetration tests.
•
Education
: We provide periodic training for all personnel regarding cybersecurity threats, with such training appropriate to the roles, responsibilities and access of the relevant Company personnel. Our policies require all workers to report any real or suspected cybersecurity events.
•
Supplier Ecosystem Management
: We extend our cybersecurity management control expectations to our supply chain ecosystem, as appropriate. This includes identifying cybersecurity risks presented by third parties.
•
Incident Response Planning
: We have established, and maintain and periodically test, incident response plans that direct our response to cybersecurity events and incidents. Such plans include the protocol by which certain significant or potentially material incidents would be communicated to executive management, our BOD, external regulators and shareholders, as appropriate.
•
Enterprise-Wide Coordination
: We engage relevant stakeholders from across the Company to identify emerging risks and respond to cybersecurity threats. This cross-functional approach includes personnel from our R&D, manufacturing, commercial, technology, legal, compliance, internal audit and other business functions.
•
Governance
: Our BOD’s oversight of cybersecurity risk management is led by the Audit Committee, which oversees our ERM program. Cybersecurity threats, risks and mitigation are periodically reviewed by the Audit Committee and such reviews include both internal and independent assessment of risks, controls and
