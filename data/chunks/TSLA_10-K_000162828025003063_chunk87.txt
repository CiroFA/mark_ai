of a segment’s profit or loss in assessing segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources.

ASU 2023-08
In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-08, Accounting for and Disclosure of Crypto Assets (Subtopic 350-60) (“new crypto assets standard”). The new crypto assets standard requires certain crypto assets to be measured at fair value separately on the balance sheet with changes reported in the statement of operations each reporting period. The new crypto assets standard also enhances the other intangible asset disclosure requirements by requiring the name, cost basis, fair value, and number of units for each significant crypto asset holding. The new crypto assets standard is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Adoption of the new crypto assets standard requires a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings as of the beginning of the annual reporting period in which an entity adopts the amendments. Early adoption is also permitted, including adoption in an interim period. However, if the new crypto assets standard is early adopted in an interim period, an entity must adopt the new crypto assets standard as of the beginning of the fiscal year that includes the interim period. We adopted the new crypto assets standard on a modified retrospective approach effective January 1, 2024.
