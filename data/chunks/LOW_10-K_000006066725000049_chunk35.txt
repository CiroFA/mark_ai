Our sales are dependent upon the health and stability of the general economy.
Adverse changes in macroeconomic factors specific to the home improvement industry have in the past and may in the future negatively impact the rate of growth of our total sales and comparable sales.
Many macroeconomic factors have in the past and may in the future adversely affect our financial performance.  These include, but are not limited to, periods of slow economic growth or recession, home price appreciation or decreasing housing turnover, age of housing stock, volatility and/or lack of liquidity from time to time in U.S. and world financial markets and the consequent reduced availability and/or higher cost of borrowing to Loweâ€™s and its customers, slower rates of growth in real disposable personal income that could affect the rate of growth in consumer spending, inflation and its impacts on discretionary spending and on our costs, shortages, and other disruptions in the labor supply, the impact of rising interest rates, consumer debt levels, changes in tax rates and policy, outbreak of pandemics, fluctuations in fuel and energy costs, inflation or deflation of commodity prices, natural disasters, geopolitical or armed conflicts, and acts of both domestic and international terrorism.
