EMIR 3.0:
The EU legislative package known as “EMIR 3.0” introduces key changes to clearing, margining and reporting requirements in the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR), including: (1) a requirement to hold an “active account” with an EU central counterparty for clearing certain euro-denominated instruments; (2) new reporting requirements for cleared trades; (3) revised clearing thresholds for financial and non-financial counterparties; and (4) amendments related to clearing to the UCITS directive. EMIR 3.0 is expected to impact EU counterparties as well as UK and non-EU entities trading with EU firms, and the collective impact of the package may increase operational complexity, necessitate a reassessment of clearing and trading strategies, and lead to higher transaction costs for BlackRock and its clients.
