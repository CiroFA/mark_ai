statements, the Corporation acquired Pioneer in a transaction accounted for as a business combination, requiring that assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recognized at their fair values as of the acquisition date, which included approximately $84 billion related to the fair values of acquired PP&E of which a significant portion relates to crude oil and natural gas properties. Crude oil and natural gas properties were valued using discounted cash flow models. Inputs and assumptions used in the discounted cash flow models included estimates for commodity prices, future production volumes, drilling and development costs, and risk-adjusted discount rates.
The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of crude oil and natural gas properties acquired in the Pioneer merger is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management, including the use of management’s specialists, when developing the fair value estimate of crude oil and natural gas properties acquired; (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management’s significant assumptions related to commodity prices, future production volumes, drilling and development costs, and risk-adjusted discount rates; and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.
Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the acquisition accounting, including controls over management’s valuation of acquired crude oil and natural gas properties. These procedures also included, among others (i) reading the merger agreement; (ii) testing management’s process for developing the fair value estimate of crude oil and natural gas properties acquired; (iii) evaluating the appropriateness of the discounted cash flow models; (iv) testing the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used in the discounted cash flow models related to historical production volumes and third-party commodity prices; and (v) evaluating the reasonableness of significant assumptions used by management related to commodity prices, future production volumes, drilling and development costs, and risk-adjusted discount rates.

Evaluating management’s assumptions relating to future production volumes and drilling and development costs involved evaluating whether the assumptions used by management were reasonable as compared to historical results of Pioneer. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in evaluating the appropriateness of the discounted cash flow models and the
