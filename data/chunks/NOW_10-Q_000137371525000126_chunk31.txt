Stock-based compensation increased by $48 million for the three months ended March 31, 2025 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2024, primarily due to additional grants to current and new employees.
Stock-based compensation is inherently difficult to forecast due to fluctuations in our stock price. Based upon our stock price as of March 31, 2025, we expect stock-based compensation to continue to increase in absolute dollars for the year ending December 31, 2025 as we continue to issue stock-based awards to our employees, but remain relatively flat as a percentage of revenue compared to the year ended December 31, 2024. We expect stock-based compensation as a percentage of revenue to decline over time as we continue to grow.
Foreign Currency Exchange
Our international operations have provided and will continue to provide a significant portion of our total revenues. Revenues outside North America represented 36% and 37% of total revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively.
We primarily transact in certain foreign currencies for sales outside of the United States. The movement of the U.S. Dollar had an immaterial impact on our revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2025.
In addition, we primarily transact in several foreign currencies for cost of revenues and operating expenses outside of the United States. The movement of the U.S. Dollar had an immaterial impact on our expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2025.
Interest Income
Interest income increased by $14 million for the three months ended March 31, 2025 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2024, primarily driven by an increase in investment income from our managed portfolio resulting from higher portfolio balances.

Other Expense, net
Other expense, net increased by $3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2025 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2024.
To mitigate our risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, we enter into foreign currency forward contracts with maturities of 12 months or less to hedge a portion of our net outstanding monetary assets and liabilities. These hedging contracts may reduce, but cannot entirely eliminate, the impact of adverse currency exchange rate movements. The gains (losses) recognized for these foreign currency forward contracts in other expense, net were immaterial for the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024.
Provision for Income Taxes
Our income tax provision was $95 million and $78 million for the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively. The income tax provision was primarily attributable to the mix of earnings and losses in countries with differing statutory tax rates, offset by excess tax benefits of stock-based compensation.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
We generate cash inflows from operations primarily from selling subscription services which are generally paid in advance of provisioning services, and
