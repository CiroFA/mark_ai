these product lines, the uncertainty associated with our estimate of ultimate losses for any particular accident period diminishes relatively quickly as actual loss experience emerges. We typically assign credibility to methods that incorporate actual loss emergence, such as the paid and reported loss development and Bornhuetter-Ferguson methods, sooner than would be the case for long-tail lines at a similar stage of development for a given origin year. The reserving process for short-tail losses arising from catastrophic events typically involves an assessment by the claims department, in conjunction with underwriters and actuaries, of our exposure and estimated losses immediately following an event and then subsequent revisions of the estimated losses as our insureds provide updated actual loss information.
Long-tail business
Long-tail business describes lines of business for which specific losses may not be known/reported for some period and for which claims can take signif
icant time to settle/close. This includes most casualty lines such as general liability, D&O, and workers' compensation. There are various factors contributing to the uncertainty and volatility of long-tail business, including the indirect impact of COVID-19 that has changed loss reporting and development patterns. In addition, uncertain future inflationary trends, changes in future legal environments, and the potential impact of major claims, such as molestation claims including the Boy Scouts of America (BSA) agreement-in-principle, added to the uncertainty and volatility in the long-tail business. Other factors are
:
•
The nature and complexity of underlying coverage provided and net limits of exposure provided
;
•
Our historical loss data and experience is sometimes too immature and lacking in credibility to rely upon for reserving purposes. Where this is the case, in our reserve analysis we may utilize industry loss ratios or industry benchmark development patterns that we believe reflect the nature and coverage of the underwritten business and its future development, where available. For such product lines, actual loss experience may differ from industry loss statistics as well as loss experience for previous underwriting years;
•
The difficulty in estimating loss trends, claims inflation (e.g., medical and judicial) and underlying economic conditions;
•
The need for professional judgment to estimate loss development patterns beyond that represented by historical data using supplemental internal or industry data, extrapolation, or a blend of both;
•
The need to address shifts in business mix or volume over time when applying historical paid and reported loss development patterns from older origin years to more recent origin years. For example, changes over time in the processes and procedures for establishing case reserves can distort reported loss development patterns or changes in ceded reinsurance structures by origin year can alter the development of paid and
