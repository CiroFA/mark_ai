Amortization of Acquisition-Related Intangibles
Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles of $567 million for the three months ended March 29, 2025 decreased by $55 million, or 9%, compared to $622 million for the prior year period. The decrease was primarily due to certain acquisition-related intangibles that were fully amortized in the prior fiscal year.
Interest Expense
Interest expense for the three months ended March 29, 2025 was $20 million, a decrease of $5 million, or 20%, compared to $25 million for the prior year period. Interest expense decreased due to the repayment of our 2.95% Senior Notes that matured in June 2024.
Other Income (Expense), Net
Other income (expense), net primarily consists of interest income from short-term investments, changes in valuation of equity investments, and foreign currency transaction gains and losses.
Other income (expense), net for three months ended March 29, 2025 was $39 million, a decrease of $14 million, or 26%, compared to $53 million for the prior year period. The decrease for the three months period was primarily due to lower interest income from lower balances held in short-term investments compared to the prior period.
Income Taxes
We determine income taxes for interim reporting periods by applying our estimated annual effective tax rate to the year-to-date results and adjusted for tax items discrete to each period.
For the three months ended March 29, 2025, we recorded an income tax provision of $123 million representing an effective tax rate of 14.8%. The difference between the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 21% and our estimated annual effective tax rate was primarily due to the income tax benefit from foreign-derived intangible income (FDII) and research and development (R&D) tax credits, partially offset by the tax rate detriment from foreign earnings.
For the three months ended March 30, 2024, we recorded an income tax benefit of $52 million representing an effective tax rate of (73.2)%. The difference between the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 21% and our estimated annual effective tax rate was primarily due to the income tax benefit from foreign-derived intangible income (FDII) and research and development (R&D) tax credits, partially offset by the tax rate detriment from foreign earnings. In addition, the tax benefit reflected discrete income tax benefits of $61 million, primarily related to tax effects of stock-based compensation.
