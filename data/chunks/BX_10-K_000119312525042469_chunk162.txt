The following tables are a reconciliation of Total GAAP Investments to Net Accrued Performance Revenues. Total GAAP Investments and Net Accrued Performance Revenues consist of the following:
Liquidity and Capital Resources
General
Blackstone’s business model derives revenue primarily from third-party Assets Under Management. Blackstone is not a capital or balance sheet intensive business and targets operating expense levels such that total management and advisory fees exceed total operating expenses each period. As a result, we require limited capital resources to support the working capital or operating needs of our businesses. We draw primarily on the long-term committed or invested capital of investors in our investment vehicles to fund the investment requirements of the Blackstone Funds and use our own realizations and cash flows to invest in growth initiatives, make commitments to our own funds, where our minimum general partner commitments are generally less than 5% of the limited partner commitments of a fund, and pay dividends to stockholders and distributions to holders of Holdings Units.
Fluctuations in our statement of financial condition result primarily from activities of the Blackstone Funds that are consolidated as well as business transactions, such as the issuance of senior notes. The majority economic ownership interests of such consolidated Blackstone Funds are reflected as Redeemable
Non-Controlling
Interests in Consolidated Entities, and
Non-Controlling
Interests in Consolidated Entities in the consolidated financial statements. The consolidation of these Blackstone Funds has no net effect on Blackstone’s Net Income or Equity. Additionally, fluctuations in our statement of financial condition also include appreciation or depreciation in Blackstone investments in the
non-consolidated
Blackstone Funds, additional investments and redemptions of such interests in the
non-consolidated
Blackstone Funds and the collection of receivables related to management and advisory fees.
