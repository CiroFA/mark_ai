Credit Risk and Concentration
Our financial instruments that are potentially subject to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, marketable debt securities, and accounts receivable. Cash equivalents consists mostly of money market funds, that primarily invest in U.S. government and agency securities. Marketable debt securities consist of investments in U.S. government securities, U.S. government agency securities, and investment grade corporate debt securities. As part of our cash management strategy, we concentrate cash deposits with large financial institutions and our marketable debt securities are held in diversified highly rated securities. Our investment portfolio in corporate debt securities is highly liquid and diversified among individual issuers. The amount of credit losses recorded for the year ended December 31, 2024 was not material.
Accounts receivable are typically unsecured and are derived from revenue earned from customers across different industries and countries. We generated
36

37

40
% of our revenue for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively, from marketers and developers based in the United States, with a majority of the revenue outside of the United States in 2024 coming from customers located in western Europe, China, Brazil, Australia, India and Canada.
We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and generally do not require collateral. We maintain an allowance for estimated credit losses, and bad debt expense on these losses was not material during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022. In the event that accounts receivable collection cycles deteriorate, our operating results and financial position could be adversely affected.
No customer represented 10% or more of total revenue during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022.
