Acquisitions
We engage in various forms of business development activities to enhance or refine our product pipeline, including acquisitions, collaborations, investments, and licensing arrangements. In connection with these arrangements, our partners may be entitled to future royalties and/or commercial milestones based on sales should products be approved for commercialization and/or milestones based on the successful progress of compounds through the development process. We account for each arrangement as either a business combination or an asset acquisition in accordance with GAAP.
Business Combinations
When an acquisition met the definition of a business under GAAP, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded at their respective fair values as of the acquisition date in our consolidated financial statements. The determination of estimated fair value required management to make significant estimates and assumptions. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the acquired net assets was recorded as goodwill. The results of operations of the acquisition are included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition.
