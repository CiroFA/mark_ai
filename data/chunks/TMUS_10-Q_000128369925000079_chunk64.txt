factors;
•
difficulties in effectively integrating the financial, operational and sustainability systems of the business involved in any such transaction into (or supplanting such systems with) our financial, operational and sustainability reporting infrastructure and internal control framework in an effective and timely manner;
•
risks of entering markets in which the Company has no or limited experience and where competitors have stronger market positions;
•
to the extent any acquired business has any international operations, potential exposures to risks associated with maintaining and expanding such operations, including unfavorable and uncertain regulatory, political, economic, tax and labor conditions;
•
potential exposure to material liabilities not discovered in the due diligence process or as a result of any litigation arising in connection with any such transaction;
•
significant transaction-related expenses in connection with any such transaction, whether consummated or not;
•
risks related to our ability to obtain any required regulatory approvals necessary to consummate any such transaction; and
•
any business, technology, service, or product involved in any such transaction may significantly under-perform relative to our expectations, and we may not achieve the benefits we expect from the transaction, which could, among other things, also result in a write-down of goodwill and other intangible assets associated with such transaction.
We have entered into joint venture agreements aimed at establishing a robust fiber broadband network that complements our fixed wireless services. Once closed, differences in views among the joint venture participants may result in delayed decisions or disputes. Operating through joint ventures in which we do not hold a majority ownership interest results in us having limited control over many decisions made with respect to the businesses of the joint ventures. We also cannot control the actions of our joint venture partners. These joint ventures may not be subject to the same requirements regarding internal controls and internal control over financial reporting that we follow. As a result, internal control problems may arise with respect to these joint ventures. Any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and could also affect our reputation.
Additionally, in connection with our Sprint Merger and related transactions, including the acquisition by DISH Network Corporation (“DISH”) of certain prepaid wireless business (the “Prepaid Transaction”), we agreed to fulfill various government commitments (the “Government Commitments”), including, among others, extensive 5G network build-out, delivering high-speed wireless services to the vast majority of Americans and marketing our in-home fixed wireless product to households
