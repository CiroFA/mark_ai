DEBT AND CREDIT FACILITIES
We have lines of credit issued by various financial institutions that
are available to fund our day-to-day operating needs. Certain of
our credit facilities require us to comply with financial and other
covenants. We were in compliance with all covenants on
March 31, 2025
.
In February 2025 we entered into a new revolving credit
agreement that replaces our previous agreement dated October
2021.
The primary changes included increasing the aggregate
principal amount of the facility by
$
750
to
$
3,000
and extending
the maturity date to February 25, 2030.
On
March 31, 2025
there
were
no
borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility
or our commercial paper program which allows for maturities up
to
397
days from the date of issuance. The maximum amount of
our commercial paper that can be outstanding at any time is
$
2,250
.
In February
2025
we issued

based on quoted active market prices and yields that took into
account the underlying terms of the debt instruments.
Substantially all of our debt is classified within Level 2 of the fair

INCOME TAXES
Our effective tax rates were
14.4
%
and
14.6
%
in the
three
months
2025
and
2024
. The effective tax rates for the
three
months
2025
and
2024
reflect the continued lower effective
income tax rates as a result of our European operations and
certain discrete tax items.
In the normal course of business, income tax authorities in
various income tax jurisdictions both within the United States and
internationally conduct routine audits of our income tax returns
filed in prior years. These audits are generally designed to
determine if individual income tax authorities are in agreement
with our interpretations of complex income tax regulations
regarding the allocation of income to the various income tax
jurisdictions. Any income tax audit assessment or draft income
tax audit assessment received at the conclusion of an audit is
reviewed and
