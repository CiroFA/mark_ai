Cash provided by financing activities during 2024 was primarily driven by the issuance of common stock and Mandatory convertible preferred stock in the fourth quarter of 2024, which resulted in cash proceeds of $18.2 billion and $5.7 billion, net of issuance costs, as well as the issuance of $10.0 billion of fixed-rate senior notes in the second quarter of 2024. During 2024, net borrowings were $1.5 billion compared to net repayments of $5.1 billion and $1.3 billion in 2023 and 2022.
At December 31, 2024 and 2023 debt balances totaled $53.9 billion and $52.3 billion, of which $1.3 billion and $5.2 billion were classified as short-term.
We had 0.4 million, 1.7 million and 0.2 million shares transferred to us from employee tax withholdings in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The increase in 2023 was primarily due to the vesting of a one-time RSU grant awarded to most employees in December 2020. In 2020, we announced the suspension of our dividend to common shareholders until further notice. As a result, we did not pay any dividends to common shareholders in 2024, 2023 and 2022.
