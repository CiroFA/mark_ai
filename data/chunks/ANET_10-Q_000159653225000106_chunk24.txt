provided by operating activities was $513.8 million, consisting of net income of $637.7 million, non-cash adjustments to net income of $7.2 million and offset by a net increase of $131.1 million in working capital requirements. The non-cash adjustments to net income were driven by stock-based compensation and depreciation and amortization, largely offset by an increase in deferred taxes primarily due to the capitalization of research and development costs under Section 174 of the Internal Revenue Code ("IRC"). The increase in working capital requirements primarily consisted of a $207.2 million decrease in accounts payable primarily due to timing of payments, an $80.0 million increase in inventory and an increase in accounts receivable of $65.5 million. These cash outflows were partly offset by a $157.5 million increase in income tax payables related to timing of payments, and an increase in deferred revenue of $157.0 million primarily resulting from an increase in customer PCS contracts, partly offset by a reduction in product deferred revenue related to customer contracts with acceptance terms, and a $38.1 million decrease in prepaid and other assets.
