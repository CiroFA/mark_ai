expense in the period in which the impairment occurs. The determination of fair value requires management to make estimates and assumptions related to revenue basis points, projected AUM growth rates, operating margins, tax rates, and discount rates.
Given the significant judgments made by management to estimate the fair value of indefinite-lived intangible assets related to certain management contracts, performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of management’s estimates and assumptions related to projected AUM growth rates, revenue basis points, operating margins, tax rates, and discount rates, required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the need to involve our fair value specialists.
How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit
Our audit procedures related to the determination of fair value of indefinite-lived intangible assets related to certain management contracts included the following, among others:
•
We tested the design and operating effectiveness of controls over the Company’s indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment analysis, including those related to management’s assessment of the factors that impact the fair value of the Company’s indefinite-lived intangible assets. This includes controls related to management’s revenue basis points, projected AUM growth rates, operating margins, tax rates, and the determination of the discount rates.
•
We evaluated the reasonableness of management’s AUM, revenue basis points, projected AUM growth rates, operating margins, tax rates and discount rates by comparing management’s projections to historical amounts, internal communications to management and the Board of Directors, and forecasted information included in analyst and industry reports for the Company and certain of its peer companies.
•
We evaluated management’s ability to accurately project revenue basis points, AUM growth rates, operating margins and tax rates, by comparing actual results to management’s historical forecasts.
•
With the assistance of our fair value specialists, we evaluated the reasonableness of the Company’s valuation methodology and assumptions, including the determination of the discount rates by: (1) testing the source information underlying the determination of the discount rate and the mathematical accuracy of the evaluation and (2) developing a range of independent estimates and comparing those to the discount rate selected by management.
•
We evaluated the impact of changes in management’s forecasts from July 31, 2024, the annual impairment assessment date, to December 31, 2024.
