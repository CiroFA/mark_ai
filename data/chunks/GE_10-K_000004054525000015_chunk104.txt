referenced in Note 1. See About GE Aerospace for a description of our reporting segments as of December 31, 2024.
Segment revenue includes sales of equipment and services by our segments. Segment profit is determined based on performance measures used by our CODM. Our CODM uses segment profit or loss to assess performance and allocate resources to each segment, primarily through periodic budgeting and segment performance reviews. In connection with that assessment, our CODM may exclude matters, such as charges for impairments, significant, higher-cost restructuring programs, costs associated with separation activities, manufacturing footprint rationalization and other similar expenses, acquisition costs and other related charges, certain gains and losses from acquisitions or dispositions and certain litigation settlements. Segment profit excludes results reported as discontinued operations and the portion of earnings or loss attributable to noncontrolling interests of consolidated subsidiaries, and as such only includes the portion of earnings or loss attributable to our share of the consolidated earnings or loss of consolidated subsidiaries. Certain corporate costs, including those related to shared services, employee benefits and information technology, are allocated to our segments based on usage or their relative net cost of operations. See the Corporate & Other section within MD&A for further information about costs excluded from segment profit.
The Company does not report total assets by segment for internal or external reporting purposes as the Company’s CODM does not assess performance, make strategic decisions, or allocate resources based on assets.
