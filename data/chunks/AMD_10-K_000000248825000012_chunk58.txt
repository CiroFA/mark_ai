Furthermore, we invest in both public and private companies to further our strategic objectives and to support certain key business initiatives. We invest in early-stage companies that may still be in the process of developing a strategic direction and may not yet generate revenue. Many of the equity and debt instruments that we invest in are non-marketable and illiquid at the time of our initial investment, and we are not always able to achieve a return.

Our investment portfolio is concentrated in specific sectors. Adverse developments in one or any of these sectors due to regulatory changes, technology disruptions or market downturns could negatively impact the performance of our investment portfolio.

We cannot assure you that we will receive the necessary regulatory approvals at all or in a timely manner or that closing conditions will be satisfied. Any delay in completing the Acquisition could cause us to not realize, or to be delayed in realizing, some or all of the benefits we expect to achieve from this transaction. Additionally, if the Acquisition is not completed, we may incur significant acquisitions costs that we may be unable to recover, which could negatively affect our business and results of operations. We would be required to pay ZT
