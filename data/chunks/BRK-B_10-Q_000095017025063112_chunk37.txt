Consolidated Balance Sheet continues to reflect significant liquidity and a very strong capital base. Berkshire’s shareholders’ equity at March 31, 2025 was $654.5 billion, an increase of $5.1 billion since December 31, 2024. Net earnings attributable to Berkshire shareholders were $4.6 billion for the first quarter of 2025 and included after-tax investment losses of approximately $5.0 billion. Investment gains and losses from changes in the market prices of our investments in equity securities usually produce significant volatility in our earnings.
Berkshire’s common stock repurchase program permits Berkshire to repurchase its Class A and Class B shares at prices below Berkshire’s intrinsic value, as conservatively determined by Warren Buffett, Berkshire’s Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer. We are not committed to a minimum or subject to a maximum repurchase amount. We will not repurchase our stock if it reduces our consolidated cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bills holdings to below $30 billion. Financial strength and redundant liquidity will always be of paramount importance at Berkshire. There were no share repurchases in the first quarter of 2025.
At March 31, 2025, our insurance and other businesses held cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bills (net of payables for unsettled purchases) of $328.0 billion. Investments in equity and fixed maturity securities, excluding our equity method investments, were $278.8 billion.
