our ability to compete in certain geographic markets or industry verticals.
We have entered into and may continue to enter into, in limited circumstances, unique contractual, pricing, and payment arrangements with our customers, including some that may be outside of our typical scope of business, including arrangements relating to the receipt of noncash consideration. Our ability to sell or transfer, convert to cash, or realize value from, any noncash consideration we have received, or may receive in the future, in a timely manner or at all, may be limited by, among other things, applicable securities law and regulations, and global market and macroeconomic conditions, which could adversely impact our business, financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations.
We face intense competition in our markets, and we may lack sufficient financial or other resources to maintain or improve our competitive position.
The markets for our platforms are very competitive, and we expect such competition to continue or increase in the future. A significant number of companies are developing products that currently, or in the future may, compete with some or all aspects of our proprietary platforms. We may not be successful in convincing the management teams of our potential customers to deploy our platforms in lieu of existing software solutions or in-house software development projects often favored by internal IT departments or other competitive products and services. In addition, our competitors include large enterprise software companies, government contractors, and system integrators, and we may face competition from emerging companies as well as established companies who have not previously entered this market. Additionally, we may be required to make substantial additional investments in our research, development, services, marketing, and sales functions in order to respond to competition, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in the future.

•
greater name recognition, longer operating histories, and larger customer bases;
•
larger sales and marketing budgets and resources and the capacity to leverage their sales efforts and marketing expenditures across a broader portfolio of products;
•
broader, deeper, or otherwise more established relationships with technology, channel and distribution partners, and customers;
•
wider geographic presence or greater access to larger potential customer bases;
•
greater focus in specific geographies;
•
lower labor and research and development costs;
•
larger and more mature intellectual property portfolios; and
•
substantially greater financial, technical, and other resources to provide services, to make acquisitions, and to develop and introduce new products and capabilities.
In addition, some of our larger competitors have substantially
