playbooks for responding to various types of cybersecurity incidents;
•
Business continuity and disaster recovery plans to support more effective response and recovery efforts in the event of a significant cybersecurity incident or disruption;
•
The use of external service providers and consultants to assess or monitor the environment or otherwise assist with aspects of our cybersecurity controls;
•
Commercially available and customized security technologies and security and business controls to limit access to and use of such sensitive data;
•
A security awareness and training program for our employees and contractors, with role-based training for certain personnel and positions; and
•
A third-party risk management framework designed to monitor and address cybersecurity risks from various third parties (including vendors, service providers, and other contractors) that includes diligence regarding the third party’s cybersecurity capabilities and additional monitoring of certain third parties based on the results of diligence. In addition, we have established standard contractual terms and conditions regarding cybersecurity applicable to third parties, as well as further downstream parties, that may be tailored to the use case and sensitivity of any data or business processes involved.
Additionally, we maintain cybersecurity insurance which may cover some or all of the potential losses from a cybersecurity incident. During the last fiscal year, we did not identify any risks from cybersecurity threats, including as a result of any previous cybersecurity incidents, that materially affected Intuit, including its business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition. However, we continue to face ongoing and increasing cybersecurity risks which may materially affect us in the future. Additional information on the cybersecurity risks is discussed in “
Risk Factors”
in Item 1A of Part I of this Annual Report, including without limitation the risk that “
Security incidents, improper access to or disclosure of our data or customers’ data, or other cyberattacks on our systems could harm our reputation, business, and financial condition.
”
Management is responsible for the day-to-day administration of the Intuit’s cybersecurity policies, processes, practices, and risk management. The Audit and Risk Committee of our Board of Directors provides primary oversight of cybersecurity risks and the Company’s efforts to mitigate those risks.
