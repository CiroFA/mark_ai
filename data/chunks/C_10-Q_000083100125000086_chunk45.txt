Services

USPB
. End-of-period deposits increased 2% sequentially, driven by
Services
and
USPB
, partially offset by a decline in
Wealth.
On an average basis, deposits decreased 2% year-over-year and decreased 1% sequentially. In the first quarter of 2025, average deposits for:
•
Services
increased 2% year-over-year, as TTS increased 1%, due to deepened client relationships and growth in operational deposits, and Securities Services increased 10%, driven by growth in Custody and Issuer Services.
•
USPB
decreased 11% year-over-year, as the transfer of certain relationships and the associated deposits to
Wealth
more than offset underlying deposit growth.
•
Wealth
decreased 2% year-over-year, driven by a shift in deposits to higher-yielding investments on Citi’s platform and other operating outflows, largely offset by the transfer of certain relationships and associated deposits from
USPB
.
•
All Other
decreased 16% year-over-year, primarily reflecting the continued wind-downs, the impact of FX translation of deposits in Legacy Franchises and reductions of corporate certificates of deposit in Corporate/Other.
