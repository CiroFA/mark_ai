and 2024, are shown in the table on page 112. The company’s estimated net proved reserves of natural gas liquids (NGLs) are shown on page 113, and the company’s estimated net proved reserves of natural gas are shown on page 114.
Noteworthy changes in crude oil, condensate and synthetic oil proved reserves for 2022 through 2024 are discussed below and shown in the table on the following page:
Revisions
In 2022, entitlement effects primarily contributed to a decrease of 49 million barrels of synthetic oil at the Athabasca Oil Sands project in Canada. In TCO, entitlement effects and changes in operating assumptions were primarily responsible for the 35 million barrels decrease in Kazakhstan.
In 2023, the 257 million barrels decrease in United States was primarily in the Midland and Delaware basins and California. Reservoir performance led to the decrease of 101 million barrels, and portfolio optimization led to a decrease of 59 million barrels in the Midland and Delaware basins. A reduction in planned development activities led to a decrease of 58 million barrels in California. In Other Americas, entitlement effects primarily contributed to an increase of 42 million barrels of synthetic oil at the Athabasca Oil Sands project in Canada. In Asia, reservoir performance, mainly in the Partitioned Zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait (the Partitioned Zone), was responsible for the 48 million barrels increase. Reservoir performance in Nigeria was mainly responsible for the 37 million barrels increase in Africa.
In 2024, the 37 million barrels increase in Asia was due to reservoir performance, primarily in the Partitioned Zone.
Extensions and Discoveries
In 2022, extensions and discoveries in the Midland, Delaware and DJ basins, and approval of the Ballymore Project in the Gulf of America, were primarily responsible for the 264 million barrels increase in the United States. In Other Americas, the 32 million barrels of extensions and discoveries were from Argentina and Canada.
In 2023, extensions and discoveries of 124 million barrels in the Midland and Delaware basins were primarily responsible for the 170 million barrels increase in the United States. In Other Americas, the 55 million barrels of extensions and discoveries increase was mainly from shale and tight assets in Argentina.
In 2024, extensions and discoveries of 119 million barrels in the Midland and Delaware basins, and 45 million barrels in the DJ basin, were primarily responsible for the 185 million barrels increase in the United States. In Other Americas, the 52 million barrels of extensions and discoveries increase was mainly from
shale and tight assets in Argentina.
Purchases
In 2022, the company exercised its option to acquire additional land acreage in the Athabasca Oil Sands project in Canada contributing 168 million barrels in synthetic oil. The extension of deepwater licenses in Nigeria and the Republic of Congo contributed 36 million barrels in Africa.
In 2023, the acquisition of PDC
