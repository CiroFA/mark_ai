decrease of $326 million (13.8%) compared to 2022. Earnings in 2023 reflected lower earnings from the home building businesses, partially offset by increased earnings from financial services. The decline in earnings from the home building businesses reflected the reduction in sales, a lower overall gross sales margin rate and higher operating expenses relative to sales. The increase in earnings from financial services was primarily attributable to increased net interest income, partially offset by increased expected loan loss provisions and higher insurance claims.
Aggregate revenues of our other building products businesses were approximately $14.5 billion in 2023, a decrease of 10.0% versus 2022. The decline in revenues reflected overall lower sales volumes and changes in product mix, partly offset by higher average selling prices. Pre-tax earnings of the other building products businesses were approximately $2.1 billion in 2023, a decrease of 11.4% compared to 2022. Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues were 14.7% in 2023, a 0.3 percentage point decrease compared to 2022. The earnings decline in 2023 was driven by lower sales volumes, reduced manufacturing efficiencies and losses from restructurings, plant closures and divestitures in 2023, partially offset by lower raw material costs and energy costs as well as reduced freight, shipping and utilities expenses.

2024 versus 2023
