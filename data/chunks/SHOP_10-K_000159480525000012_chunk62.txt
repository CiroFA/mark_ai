Given uncertainty around these rules, we could experience discriminatory or anti-competitive practices that could impede both our and our merchants’ growth, increase our costs or adversely affect our business. If buyers or merchants become unable, unwilling or less willing to use the internet for commerce for any reason, including lack of access to high-speed communications equipment, congestion of traffic on the internet, internet outages or delays, disruptions or other damage to merchants’ and buyers’ computers, increases in the cost of accessing the internet and security and privacy risks or the perception of such risks, our business could be adversely affected.
Provisions of our financial instruments may restrict our ability to pursue our business strategies or to pay cash upon conversion or purchase of the Notes and we may not have funds necessary to settle the Notes in cash, to purchase the Notes upon a fundamental change or repay the Notes at maturity.
Under the indenture governing the Notes, we are not restricted from paying dividends, incurring additional indebtedness or issuing or purchasing securities (by us or any of our subsidiaries). However, any debt instruments we may enter into in the future may require us, to comply with various covenants that limit our ability to, among other things:
•
dispose of assets;
•
complete mergers or acquisitions;
•
incur indebtedness;
•
encumber assets;
•
pay dividends or make other distributions to holders of our shares;
•
make specified investments;
•
change certain key management personnel;
•
engage in any business other than the businesses we currently engage in; and
•
engage in transactions with our affiliates.
Furthermore, the indenture for the Notes prohibits us from engaging in certain consolidations, mergers, amalgamations, arrangements, binding share exchanges or transfers or leases of all or substantially all of our assets unless, among other things, the resulting or surviving entity assumes our obligations under the Notes. Even if such transactions are permitted, they may be considered a fundamental change under the indenture. These restrictions could inhibit our ability to pursue our business strategies. We may incur additional indebtedness in the future, some of which may be secured debt. The instruments governing such indebtedness could contain provisions that are as, or more, restrictive than our existing debt instruments, including the indenture governing the Notes. Any such restrictions could have the effect of further restricting our ability to pursue business strategies and diminishing our ability to make payments

on the Notes when due. If we are unable to repay, refinance or restructure additional future indebtedness when payment is due, the lenders could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure such indebtedness, as applicable, or force us into bankruptcy or liquidation. In certain events of bankruptcy, or liquidation involving us or our
