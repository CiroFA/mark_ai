Restricted Stock Awards.
Restrictions on the restricted stock issued under the Plans generally lapse over various periods up to
five years
. At the grant date of the award, recipients of restricted stock are granted voting rights and generally receive dividends on unvested shares, paid in the form of cash on each dividend payment date. Dividends paid on unvested shares were immaterial for fiscal 2024, fiscal 2023, and fiscal 2022. Additionally, the majority of our restricted stock awards may become non-forfeitable upon the associate’s attainment of age
60
, provided the associate has had
five years
of continuous service. The fair value of restricted stock is based on the closing stock price on the date of grant and is expensed over the period during which the restrictions lapse.
Restricted Stock Units.
Each restricted stock unit entitles the associate to
one
share of common stock to be received upon vesting up to
five years
after the grant date. Additionally, the majority of these awards may become non-forfeitable upon the associate reaching age
60
, provided the associate has had
five years
of continuous service. Recipients of restricted stock units have no voting rights until the vesting of the award. Recipients receive dividend equivalents that accrue on unvested units and are paid out in the form of additional shares of stock on the vesting date. The fair value of restricted stock units is based on the closing stock price on the date of grant and is expensed over the period during which the units vest.

Performance Share Awards.
We also grant performance share awards under the Plans. Recipients of performance share awards have no voting rights until the shares are issued following completion of the performance period. Dividend equivalents accrue on performance shares (as reinvested shares) and are paid upon the payout of the award based upon the actual number of shares earned.
Certain of these performance share awards provide for the issuance of shares of our common stock at the end of a
three-year
performance cycle based upon our performance against target average ROIC and operating profit over that performance cycle. These awards become non-forfeitable upon the associate’s attainment of age
60
, provided the associate has had
five years
of continuous service and minimum performance targets are achieved. The fair value of these performance share awards is based on the closing stock price on the date of grant.
Separately, in relation to the SRS acquisition, we also granted performance share awards to various SRS employees. These awards provide for the issuance of
