million), and MQ-25 ($339 million). Net unfavorable cumulative contract catch-up adjustments were $3,534 million higher than the comparable period in the prior year. See further discussion of fixed-price contracts in Note 14 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
BDS loss from operations in 2023 of $1,764 million decreased by $1,780 million compared with $3,544 million in 2022. The decrease is primarily due to $2,863 million of lower charges in 2023 on fixed-price development programs that were partially offset by lower earnings across other programs including satellites and F-15, as well as higher period expenses. During 2023, losses incurred on the five fixed-price development programs totaled $1,585 million compared with $4,448 million in 2022. Charges on fixed-price development programs in 2023 included VC-25B ($482 million), KC-46A Tanker ($309 million), Commercial Crew ($288 million), T-7A Red Hawk ($275 million) and MQ-25 ($231 million). Loss from operations in 2023 includes a $315 million impact from an agreement with one of our satellite customers which includes customer considerations as well as increased costs to enhance the

constellation and meet lifecycle commitments. Net unfavorable cumulative contract catch-up adjustments were $2,328 million better than in 2022.

BDS loss from operations includes our share of income from equity method investments of $125 million, $44 million and $13 million primarily from our United Launch Alliance and other joint ventures in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
Backlog
Total backlog of $64,023 million at December 31, 2024 was $5,011 million higher than December 31, 2023, reflecting the timing of awards, partially offset by revenue recognized on contracts awarded in prior periods.
Additional Considerations
Our BDS business includes a variety of development programs which have complex design and technical challenges. Some of these programs have cost-type contracting arrangements. In these cases, the associated financial risks are primarily reduced award or incentive fees, lower profit rates or program cancellation if cost, schedule or technical performance issues arise. Examples of these programs include Ground-based Midcourse Defense, Proprietary and Space Launch System programs.
Some of our development programs are contracted on a fixed-price basis. Examples of significant fixed-price development programs include Commercial Crew, KC-46A Tanker, MQ-25, T-7A Red Hawk, VC-25B, and commercial and military satellites. A number of our ongoing fixed-price development programs have reach-forward losses. New programs could also have risk for reach-forward loss upon contract award and during the period of contract performance. Many development programs have highly complex designs. As technical or quality issues arise during development, we may experience schedule delays and cost impacts,
