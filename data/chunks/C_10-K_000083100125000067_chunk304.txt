in tandem with the liquidators’ pending consolidated direct appeal.
In May 2023, the liquidators voluntarily dismissed the single pending claim against Citibank (Switzerland) AG and Citivic Nominees Ltd. without prejudice, but the action continued against other defendants. On January 9, 2025, the liquidators voluntarily dismissed the entire action with prejudice, thereby permanently disposing of the single pending claim the liquidators previously voluntarily dismissed without prejudice. The claims previously dismissed by the bankruptcy court against Citibank (Switzerland) AG and Citivic Nominees Ltd. remain subject to the pending consolidated direct appeal in the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit and are unaffected by the liquidators’ voluntary dismissals.
