December 31, 2023, we had outstanding notes with an aggregate carrying value of $60.6 billion and an aggregate fair value of $59.2 billion. Our outstanding notes were composed of debt with fixed interest rates. Changes in interest rates do not affect interest expense on fixed-rate debt. Changes in interest rates would, however, affect the fair values of fixed-rate debt. A hypothetical 100 basis point decrease in interest rates relative to interest rates as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, would have resulted in increases of $4.7 billion and $5.4 billion, respectively, in the aggregate fair values of our outstanding debt on these dates. The sensitivity analysis of the notes does not consider the impact that hypothetical changes in interest rates would have on related interest rate swap contracts and cross-currency swap contracts, discussed below. In addition, the analysis above does not include our term loans, which had carrying values of $1.8 billion and $4.0 billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The fair values of our term loans approximate their carrying values as these debt instruments bear interest at floating rates.
To achieve a desired mix of fixed-rate and floating-rate debt, we entered into interest rate swap contracts that qualified and were designated for accounting purposes as fair value hedges for certain of our fixed-rate debt. These interest rate swap contracts effectively converted a fixed-rate interest coupon to a floating-rate SOFR-based coupon over the terms of the respective notes. Interest rate swap contracts with an aggregate notional amount of $6.7 billion were outstanding as of both December 31, 2024 and 2023. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates relative to interest rates as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, would have resulted in reductions in fair values of approximately $220 million and $180 million, respectively, on our interest rate swap contracts on these dates. Analysis of the interest rate swap contracts does not consider the impact that hypothetical changes in interest rates would have on the related fair values of debt that these interest-rate-sensitive instruments were designed to offset.
As of both December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had outstanding cross-currency swap contracts with aggregate notional amounts of $2.7 billion that hedge our foreign-currency-denominated debt and related interest payments. These contracts effectively convert interest payments and principal repayment of this debt to U.S. dollars from euros and pounds sterling and are designated for accounting purposes as cash flow hedges. A hypothetical 100 basis point adverse movement in interest rates relative to interest rates as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, would have resulted in reductions in the fair values of our cross-currency swap contracts of approximately $70 million and $100 million, respectively.
