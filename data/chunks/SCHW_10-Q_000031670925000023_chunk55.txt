THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION
Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Data, Ratios, or as Noted)
(Unaudited)
At March 31, 2025, the Company had pledged AFS securities consisting of U.S. Treasury securities with an aggregate fair value of $
371
million as initial margin on interest rate swaps (see Notes 11 and 12). All of Schwab’s interest rate swaps are cleared through central counterparty (CCP) clearing houses which require the Company to post initial margin as collateral against potential losses. Initial margin is posted through futures commission merchants (FCM) which serve as the intermediary between the CCPs and Schwab. The FCM agreements governing our swaps allow for securities pledged as initial margin to be sold, repledged, or otherwise used by the FCM.
AFS securities with unrealized losses, aggregated by category and period of continuous unrealized loss, are as follows:
(1)
Unrealized losses less than 12 months amounts were less than $
500
thousand.
(2)
For purposes of this table, unrealized losses on AFS securities excludes the unallocated PLM fair value hedge basis adjustments of $
28
million and $
47
million at March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively.
At March 31, 2025, substantially all rated securities in the investment portfolios were investment grade. U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities do not have explicit credit ratings; however, management considers these to be of the highest credit quality and rating given the guarantee of principal and interest by the U.S. government or U.S. government-sponsored enterprises.
For a description of management’s quarterly evaluation of AFS securities in unrealized loss positions, see Item 8 – Note 2 in the 2024 Form 10-K.
No
amounts were recognized as credit loss expense and
no
securities were written down to fair value through earnings for the three months ended March 31, 2025 and the year ended December 31, 2024.
None
of the Company’s AFS securities held as of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024 had an allowance for credit losses. All HTM securities as of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024 were U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities and therefore had
no
allowance for credit losses because expected nonpayment of the amortized cost basis is zero.
The Company had $
418
million and $
455
million of accrued interest for AFS and HTM securities as of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively. These amounts are excluded from the amortized cost basis and fair market value of AFS and HTM securities and included in other assets on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. There were
no
writeoffs of accrued interest receivable on AFS and HTM securities during the three months ended March 31, 2025, or for the year ended December 31, 2024.
