guaranteed and actual future results may vary materially. The Company does not assume the obligation to update any forward-looking statement. The Company cautions you not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. Although it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors, they may include the following:

Lost market opportunity resulting from delays and uncertainties in the approval process of the FDA and/or foreign regulatory authorities.
