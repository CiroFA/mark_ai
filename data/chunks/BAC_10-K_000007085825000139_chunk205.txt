Commercial Real Estate
Commercial real estate primarily includes commercial loans secured by non-owner-occupied real estate and is dependent on the sale or lease of the real estate as the primary source of
repayment. Outstanding loans decreased $7.1 billion, or 10 percent, during 2024 to $65.7 billion driven by multiple property types, including office. The commercial real estate portfolio is primarily managed in
Global Banking
and consists of loans made primarily to public and private developers, and commercial real estate firms. The portfolio remains diversified across property types and geographic regions. California represented the largest state concentration at 21 percent and 20 percent of commercial real estate at December 31, 2024 and 2023.
Reservable criticized utilized exposure increased $1.4 billion, or 16 percent, during 2024 primarily driven by industrial/warehouse and multi-family rental loans. Office loans represented the largest property type concentration at 23 percent of the commercial real estate portfolio at December 31, 2024, and approximately one percent of total loans for the Corporation. This property type is roughly 75 percent Class A and had an origination loan-to-value of approximately 55 percent.
Reservable criticized exposure for the office property type was $5.1 billion at December 31, 2024, representing a decrease of $398 million, or seven percent, from December 31, 2023, with an aggregate loan-to-value of approximately 85 percent based on property appraisals completed in the last twelve months. Approximately $5.1 billion of office loans are scheduled to mature by the end of 2025.
During 2024, net charge-offs increased $619 million to $864 million driven by office loans. We use a number of proactive risk mitigation initiatives to reduce adversely rated exposure in the commercial real estate portfolio, including transfers of deteriorating exposures for management by independent special asset officers and the pursuit of loan
restructurings or asset sales to achieve the best results for our customers and the Corporation.
