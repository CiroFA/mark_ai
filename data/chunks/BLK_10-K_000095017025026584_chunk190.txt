Performance-Based Stock Options
In 2017, pursuant to the Award Plan, the Company awarded performance-based stock option grants to certain employees ("2017 Performance-based Options"). Vesting of 2017 Performance-based Options was contingent upon the achievement of obtaining
125
% of BlackRock's grant-date stock price within
five years
from the grant date and the attainment of Company performance measures during the
four-year
performance period. Both hurdles have been achieved, and each of the three tranches of the awards vested in equal installments at the end of
2022
,
2023
and
2024
, respectively. Vested 2017 Performance-based Options are exercisable for
up to nine years
following the grant date. The expense for each tranche is amortized over the respective requisite service period. The total fair value of 2017 Performance-based Options vested during
2024 was
$
52
million
. The aggregate intrinsic value of 2017 Performance-based Options exercised during 2024 was
$
373
million
.
The options have a strike price of $
513.50
, which was the closing price of the shares on the grant date.
The grant-date fair value of the awards issued in 2017 was $
208
million and was estimated using a Monte Carlo simulation with an embedded lattice model using the assumptions included in the following table:
(1)
The expected term was derived using a Monte Carlo simulation with the embedded lattice model and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding.
(2)
The expected stock volatility was based upon an average of historical stock price fluctuations of BlackRockâ€™s common stock and an implied volatility at the grant date.
(3)
The expected dividend yield was calculated as the most recent quarterly dividend divided by the average three-month stock price as of the grant date.
(4)
The risk-free interest rate is based on the US Treasury Constant Maturities yield curve at grant date.
On May 30, 2023, pursuant to the Award Plan, the Company awarded performance-based options to purchase
814,482
shares of BlackRock common stock to certain employees as long-term incentive compensation ("2023 Performance-based Options"). Vesting of 2023 Performance-based Options is contingent upon the achievement of obtaining
130
% of grant-date stock price over 60 calendar days within
four years
from the grant date and attainment of a predetermined Company performance measure during the
three-year
performance period. As of December 31, 2024, the price hurdle was achieved and the Company assumes that the performance measure will be achieved. Accordingly, the awards are expected to vest in three tranches of
25
%,
25
% and
50
% in May of
2027
,
2028
and
2029
, respectively. Vested 2023 Performance-based Options are exercisable for
