SEGMENT FINANCIAL DATA
Honeywell globally manages its business operations through
four
reportable business segments. Segment information is consistent with how the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, who is the Company's chief operating decision maker, and management reviews the businesses, makes investing and resource allocation decisions, and assesses operating performance.
Effective during the second quarter of 2024, the Company updated its calculation of segment profit to exclude the impact of amortization expense for acquisition-related intangible assets and certain acquisition-related costs.
The Company recast historical periods to reflect segment profit
under this new basis to facilitate comparability. In the third quarter of 2024, the Company clarified its calculation of segment profit to exclude divestiture-related costs and impairments.
Honeywell’s senior management evaluates segment performance based on segment profit. Each segment’s profit is measured as segment income (loss) before taxes excluding general corporate unallocated expense, interest and other financial charges, interest income, amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, certain acquisition- and divestiture-related costs, impairment of assets held for sale, stock compensation expense, pension and other postretirement income (expense), repositioning and other charges, and other items within Other (income) expense.
