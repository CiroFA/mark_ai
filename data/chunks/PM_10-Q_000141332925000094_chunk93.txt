the first three months of 2025, net cash used in operating activities was $350 million as compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $241 million in the first three months of 2024. Excluding favorable currency movements, the unfavorable variance of $0.7 billion was due primarily to higher working capital requirements of $1.3 billion, partly offset by higher currency-neutral net earnings, excluding non-cash depreciation and amortization expense.
The higher working capital requirements in 2025 as compared with 2024 were primarily due to more cash used in inventories, coupled with more cash used in accrued liabilities and other current assets, mainly reflecting the timing of excise tax-paid inventory movements primarily related to excise tax increases and the timing of the corresponding excise tax payments. Excise tax payments included the disputed supplemental tax surcharge on heated tobacco products in Germany of approximately $0.8 billion as PMI elected to pay the supplemental tax surcharge in January 2025 to avoid the future addition of interest (for further details see â€“ please refer to the MD&A segments Europe section where we describe the case in details).
For the full year 2025, we currently expect net cash provided by operating activities of more than $11 billion at prevailing exchange rates, subject to year-end working capital requirements. This takes into account certain payments relating to the German tax surcharge and the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which amount to approximately $1 billion.
Net Cash Provided by (Used in) Investing Activities
During the first three months of 2025, net cash used in investing activities was $434 million as compared to $193 million in the first three months of 2024. This increase in net cash used was primarily due to changes in the cash collateral posted for derivative instruments, reflecting the appreciation of the Euro and Swiss franc versus U.S. dollar.
Capital expenditures of $404 million during the first three months of 2025 decreased by $13 million as compared with the first three months of 2024. The 2025 capital expenditures were primarily related to our ongoing investments in smoke-free product manufacturing capacity. We expect total capital expenditures in 2025 to be around $1.5 billion, including further investments in

Net Cash Provided by (Used in) Financing Activities
During the first three months of 2025, net cash provided by financing activities was $0.7 billion as compared to $1.1 billion in the first three months of 2024. The decrease in net cash provided was primarily due to changes in the cash collateral received for derivative instruments, reflecting the appreciation of the Euro and Swiss franc versus U.S. dollar. The decrease was partially offset by higher net borrowings in 2025 (primarily higher commercial paper outstanding in 2025, partly offset by long-term debt repayments in 2025 and long-term debt proceeds in 2024).
