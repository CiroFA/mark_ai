nonperforming home equity loans at December 31, 2024, $246 million, or 60 percent, were current on contractual payments. In addition, $83 million, or 20 percent, were 180 days or more past due and had been written down to the estimated fair value of the collateral, less costs to sell. Accruing loans that were 30 days or more past d
ue remained relatively unchanged in
2024 compared to 2023.
Of the $25.7 billion in total home equity portfolio outstandings at December 31, 2024, as shown in Table 23, nine percent require interest-only payments. The outstanding balance of HELOCs that had reached the end of their draw period and entered the amortization period was $3.4 billion at December 31, 2024. The HELOCs that have entered the amortization period have experienced a higher percentage of early stage delinquencies and nonperforming status when compared to the HELOC portfolio as a whole. At December 31,
2024, $30 million, or one percent, of outstanding HELOCs that had entered the amortization period were accruing past due 30 days or more. In addition, at December 31, 2024, $244 million, or seven percent, were nonperforming.
For our interest-only HELOC portfolio, we do not actively track how many of our home equity customers pay only the minimum amount due on their home equity loans and lines; however, we can infer some of this information through a review of our HELOC portfolio that we service and is still in its revolving period. During 2024, 15 percent of these customers with an outstanding balance did not pay any principal on their HELOCs.
