We recognize that this transformation from cigarettes to SFPs will take time and that the rate of transformation will depend in part upon factors beyond our control, such as the willingness of governments, regulators, and other policy groups to embrace SFPs as a desirable alternative to continued cigarette smoking. As a leading international cigarette manufacturer, we will continue to accelerate this transformation by using our extensive commercial and distribution infrastructure as an effective platform for the commercialization of our SFPs, and communication with adult smokers and trade partners about the substantiated benefits of switching to our SFPs. As long as a significant number of adult smokers continue to smoke cigarettes, responsible leadership of the category is critical. We aim to maintain our competitive position in the cigarette market through selective investment. We are judiciously reallocating resources from cigarettes to SFPs and are streamlining our cigarette portfolio.
We have a range of SFPs in various stages of development, scientific assessment, and commercialization.  We are committed to conducting rigorous scientific assessments of our SFPs to substantiate that they reduce exposure to HPHCs and, ultimately, that these products present, are likely to present, or have the potential to present less risk of harm to adult smokers who switch to SFPs versus continued cigarette smoking. We draw upon a team of expert scientists and engineers from a broad spectrum of scientific disciplines and our extensive learnings of adult consumer preferences to further develop and assess our SFPs. Our efforts are guided by the following key objectives:
•
to develop SFPs as satisfying alternatives to smoking for adult smokers who would otherwise continue to smoke cigarettes;
•
for those adult smokers, our goal is to develop and offer SFPs with a scientifically substantiated risk-reduction profile that approaches as closely as possible the risk-reduction profile associated with smoking cessation;

•
to substantiate the reduction of risk for the individual adult smoker and the reduction of harm to the population as a whole, based on scientific evidence of the highest standard that is made available for scrutiny and review by external independent scientists and relevant regulatory bodies; and
•
to advocate for the development of science-based regulatory frameworks for the development and commercialization of SFPs, including the communication of scientifically substantiated information to enable adult smokers to make better choices.
Our SFPs
Our product development is based on the elimination of combustion via tobacco heating and other innovative systems, as well as through oral tobacco and nicotine products, which we believe are the most promising paths to providing a better consumer choice for those who would otherwise continue to smoke cigarettes. We recognize that no single product will appeal to all adult smokers. Therefore,
