average BDA balances, an increase in the amount paid to clients due to higher interest rates, and the breakage fees incurred in 2023. These factors contributed to the decrease in average net yield in 2023 compared to 2022. The decrease in average BDA balances in 2023 compared to 2022 was primarily due to client cash allocation decisions in response to rising short-term market interest rates throughout 2022 and through the first three quarters of 2023. The percentages of BDA balances designated as fixed-rate and floating-rate obligation amounts as of December 31, 2023 were 86% and 14%, respectively.

Other Revenue
Other revenue includes industry fees (formerly referred to as exchange processing fees), certain service fees, other gains and losses from the sale of assets, and the provision for credit losses on bank loans.
Other revenue increased $34 million, or 5%, in 2024 compared to 2023 primarily due to higher industry fees and lower losses recognized on sales of AFS securities, partially offset by certain lower service and other fees and a smaller release from the provision for credit losses on bank loans. Industry fees increased in 2024 due to higher average SEC fee rates in effect during 2024 compared to 2023. Effective May 22, 2024, the SEC increased its fee rate applicable to most securities transactions from the rate in effect since late February 2023.
Other revenue decreased $63 million, or 8%, in 2023 compared to 2022 primarily due to lower industry fees, net losses on sales of AFS securities, and certain lower service and other fees, partially offset by lower provision for credit losses on bank loans. Industry fees decreased primarily due to a decrease in the SEC fee rate which became effective in the first quarter of 2023 and lower year-to-date options volume. The provision for credit losses on bank loans was lower as loan loss factors decreased while the total balance of First Mortgages increased slightly compared to year-end 2022. The Company’s provision for credit losses on bank loans in 2022 reflected increased loan loss factors driven primarily by higher forecasted interest rates earlier in the Federal Reserve’s monetary tightening, as well as growth in the loan portfolio. In addition, other revenue in 2022 included $46 million in gains on the sale of Schwab Compliance Technologies, Inc. and certain investments.
