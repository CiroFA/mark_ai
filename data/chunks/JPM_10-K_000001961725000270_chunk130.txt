economy. Both physical risks and transition risks associated with climate change could have negative impacts on the financial condition or creditworthiness of JPMorganChase’s clients and customers, on JPMorganChase's exposure to affected companies and markets, and on the effectiveness of JPMorganChase’s existing business strategy with respect to its operations, clients and customers.
Physical risks include the increased frequency or severity of acute weather events, such as floods, wildfires and tropical cyclones, and chronic shifts in the climate, such as rising sea levels, persistent changes in precipitation levels, or increases in average ambient temperatures. Potential adverse impacts of climate-related physical risks to JPMorganChase, its clients or customers include:
•
declines in asset values, including due to the destruction or degradation of property
•
reduced availability or increased cost of insurance for clients of JPMorganChase
•
interruptions to business operations, including supply chain disruption, and
•
population migration or unemployment in affected regions.
Transition risks arise from the financial and economic consequences of society’s shift towards a lower-carbon economy, such as changes in public policy, adoption of new technologies or changes in consumer preferences towards low-carbon goods and services. These risks could also be influenced by changes in the physical climate. Potential adverse impacts of transition risks to JPMorganChase, its clients or customers include:
•
sudden devaluation of assets, including unanticipated write-downs (“stranded assets”)
•
increased operational and compliance costs driven by changes in climate policy
•
increased energy costs driven by governmental actions and initiatives such as emission pricing and accelerated decarbonization policies
•
negative consequences to business models, and the need to make changes in response to those consequences, and
•
damage to JPMorganChase’s reputation, including due to any perception that its business practices are contrary to public policy or the preferences of different stakeholders.
Climate risks can also arise from inconsistencies and conflicts in the manner in which climate policy and financial regulations are implemented in the many regions where JPMorganChase operates, including initiatives to apply and enforce policy and regulation with extraterritorial effect. Additionally, internal models and estimations used in climate risk assessments have an increased level of uncertainty due to limited historical trend information and the absence of standardized, reliable and comprehensive greenhouse gas emissions data, which could lead to inaccurate disclosures or financial reporting.
