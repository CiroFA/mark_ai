Restricted stock and restricted stock units
Grants of restricted stock and restricted stock units awarded under the Amended 2016 LTIP typically have a
4
-year vesting period, subject to vesting as to one-quarter of the award each anniversary of grant. Restricted stock and restricted stock units are principally granted at market close price on the day of grant. Each service-based restricted stock unit and performance stock unit represents our obligation to deliver to the holder one Common Share upon vesting (or the end of the deferral period, if the unit is under the Chubb Deferred Stock Unit Plan).
Chubb also grants restricted stock awards to non-management directors which vest at the following year's annual general meeting.
