establish and maintain effective, efficient and controlled data management could adversely impact our development of products and client relationships and increase operational losses and regulatory and reputational risk.
Our operations, businesses and clients could be adversely affected by the impacts related to climate change.
Climate change and related environmental sustainability matters present short-, medium- and long-term risks. The physical risks include an increase in the frequency and severity of extreme weather events and natural disasters, including floods, wildfires, hurricanes and tornados, and chronic longer-term shifts such as rising average global temperatures and sea levels. Such disasters and effects could adversely impact our facilities, employees and clientsâ€™ ability to repay outstanding loans, disrupt the operations of us and our clients or third parties, cause supply chain or distribution network disruptions, damage collateral and/or result in market volatility, rapid deposit outflows or drawdowns of credit facilities, the deterioration of the value of collateral or insurance shortfalls.
There is also increasing risk related to the transition to a low-carbon economy. Changes in consumer preferences or financial condition of our clients and counterparties, market pressures, advancements in technology and additional legislation, regulatory, compliance and legal requirements could alter our strategic planning and the scope of our existing businesses, limit our ability to pursue certain business activities and offer certain products and services, amplify credit and market risks, negatively impact asset values, require capital
expenditures and changes in technology and markets, including supply chain and insurance availability and cost, increase expenses and adversely impact our capital requirements and results of operations. Particularly, there is a global regulatory focus on climate change and existing and pending disclosure requirements in various jurisdictions, with jurisdictional divergence, which is expected to impact our legal, compliance and public disclosure risks and costs.
Our climate change strategies, policies, and disclosures, which may evolve over time, our ability to achieve our climate-related goals and targets and/or the environmental or climate impacts attributable to our products, services or transactions may impact legal and compliance risk and could result in reputational harm as a result of negative public sentiment, regulatory scrutiny, litigation and reduced investor and stakeholder confidence. Due to divergent views of stakeholders, we are at increased risk that any action, or lack thereof, by us concerning our response to climate change will be perceived negatively by some stakeholders, which could adversely impact our reputation and businesses. Our ability to meet our climate-related goals and targets, including our goal to achieve certain greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions targets by 2030 and net zero GHG
