Performance Obligations
As of October 27, 2024, the amount of remaining unsatisfied performance obligations on contracts, primarily consisting of written purchase orders received from customers, with an original estimated duration of one year or more was approximately $
3.7
billion, of which approximately
62
% is expected to be recognized within
12
months and the remainder is expected to be recognized within the following
24
months thereafter.
New export rules and regulations issued in December 2024 are expected to have an immaterial impact on remaining unsatisfied performance obligations on contracts with an original estimated duration of one year or more.
We have elected the available practical expedient to exclude the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for contracts with an original expected duration of one year or less.
