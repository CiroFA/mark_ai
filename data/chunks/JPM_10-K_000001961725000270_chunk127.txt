Basel III. If JPMorganChase’s models or estimations are not approved by its regulators, it may be subject to higher capital charges, which could adversely affect its financial results or limit the ability to expand its businesses.
Lapses, weaknesses or deficiencies in controls over disclosure or financial reporting could materially affect JPMorganChase’s profitability or reputation.
JPMorganChase’s businesses and operations are subject to complex and evolving laws, rules and regulations, both within and outside the U.S., requiring continuous enhancements to various disclosures in its financial statements and regulatory reports.
There can be no assurance that JPMorganChase’s disclosure controls and procedures will be effective in every circumstance, or that a material weakness or significant deficiency in internal control over financial reporting will not occur. Any such lapse, weakness or
