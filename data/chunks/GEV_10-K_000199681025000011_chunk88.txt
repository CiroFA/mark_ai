recorded on the settlement of a previously canceled project in the third quarter, and less demand for blades from external customers at LM.
Onshore Wind revenues increased slightly due to improved pricing and delivery of more units in the U.S., partially offset by lower revenue
in the international market as we continue our selectivity resulting in fewer unit deliveries.

$4.8 billion

,
14.5%
, and
11.7%
for the years ended De
cember 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. The increase in gross profit in 2024 was due to an increase
at Power due to Gas Power Services driven from volume, mix, productivity, and price, which more than offset inflation; an increase at
Electrification due to higher volume, price, and cost productivity at Grid Solutions and Electrification
Software
; and an increase at Wind, due
to Onshore Wind through improved pricing, volume, market selectivity, and the impact of cost reduction activities, and a gain recorded on
the settlement of a previously canceled project at Offshore Wind, partially offset by incremental contract losses at Offshore Wind.

of revenues for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. The decrease in
costs in 2024 was primarily attributable to a $0.3 billion arbitration refund received in the second quarter of 2024 and cost reduction
initiatives, partially offset by higher corporate costs required to operate as a stand-alone public company and separation costs.
