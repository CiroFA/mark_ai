The increase in organic sales in 2024 was due to strength in commercial OEM, commercial aftermarket, and military OEM. The increase in organic sales in 2023 was primarily due to broad-based strength across all markets with particular strength in commercial OEM and aftermarket.
The operating margin increased from 22.9% in 2023 to 23.0% in 2024. Material factors affecting the operating margin were a 470 basis point increase from higher sales and a 70 basis point increase from the sale of a production facility in the first quarter of 2024, partially offset by a 280 basis point decline from higher commodity and wage inflation, a 180 basis point decline from higher costs to support growth initiatives, and a 70 basis point decline from unfavorable product mix. The operating margin decreased from 23.2% in 2022 to 22.9% in 2023 primarily due to commodity and wage inflation, unfavorable product mix, and higher costs to support growth initiatives, partially offset by higher sales volumes including inflationary pricing recovery.

The increase in organic sales in 2023 was primarily due to strength in the North American, European, and Asia Pacific regions, partially offset by weakness in the South American truck, bus and agriculture markets.
The operating margin increased from 16.3% in 2023 to 18.0% in 2024. Material factors affecting this increase were a 190 basis point increase from operating efficiencies and a 60 basis point increase from the sale of a non-production facility in the second quarter of 2024, partially offset by a 70 basis point decrease from lower income from investments in associate companies. The operating margin increased from 16.0% in 2022 to 16.3% in 2023 primarily due to higher sales volumes including net price realization, partially offset by operating inefficiencies.
