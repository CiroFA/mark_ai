objectives:
•
Energy Efficiency Improvements.
We continue to implement sustainability projects at our facilities, including energy management and control systems, automation systems for boilers, LED lighting, HVAC controls and refrigerants, variable frequency drives, occupancy sensors, metering, and renewable energy. We require our largest sites to identify their significant energy use in line with ISO 50001, obtain an energy audit on an established cycle, train personnel on energy management, and track identified projects via our standard database. This ensures a robust pipeline of both low-cost and capital projects that can be considered for execution.
•
Managing Air Emissions.
We manage air emissions in accordance with all regulatory requirements while also seeking to minimize our environmental impact. We require all of our manufacturing locations to meet the requirements of our Air Emissions procedure that is part of the Health, Safety, Environment, Product Stewardship, and Sustainability (HSEPS) Management System. These requirements include, but are not limited to, identifying and detailing all emissions to air on an inventory that captures them, developing operational controls, and standardized compliance obligation tracking for permit conditions and regulatory requirements. Where there are industrial air emissions that do not have specific legal or permit requirements, we implement best management practices, where available.
•
Wastewater Management.
We require our locations and functions to manage water use and wastewater effluent in accordance with our HSEPS Management System. In addition to meeting all legal and regulatory requirements, the HSEPS Management System requires Honeywell manufacturing locations to complete actions such as maintain an inventory of its uses, discharges, and consumption of water, develop location-specific operation controls to manage wastewater, and provide training for employees and contractors who perform critical activities related to wastewater.
•
Environmental Remediation.
We recognize idle properties as assets that can be revitalized to mutually benefit communities and the company. The properties that emerge from this approach ignite civic pride and catalyze further community development initiatives. Using cutting-edge science, design, and engineering to protect human health and the environment, we work cooperatively with governments and engage with local communities and other external stakeholders to implement effective solutions.
•
Reducing Greenhouse Gas Emissions
. As part of our commitment to reduce GHG emissions, we have been implementing solar projects to reduce dependency on conventional power sources, including installing rooftop and carport solar systems at various facilities to offset the sites' energy usage.
•
Minimizing Waste
. We require all of our locations and functions to handle waste in accordance with our HSEPS Management System, which includes but is not limited to, detailed
