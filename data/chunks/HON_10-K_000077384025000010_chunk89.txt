rate of return on an annual basis and revises it as appropriate.
For non-U.S. benefit plans, actuarial assumptions reflect economic and market factors relevant to each country.
In July 2024, the UK Court of Appeal upheld a ruling in the matter of Virgin Media Limited versus NTL Pension Trustees II Limited, that certain historical amendments for contracted out defined benefit schemes were invalid if they were not accompanied by the correct actuarial confirmation, a decision that the Company was not a party to or involved in and could impact the Company's non-U.S. pension plan in the UK. The Company and its UK pension scheme trustee are reviewing this development, along with our actuaries, and considering whether this decision has any implications for its UK pension plan.
