special shareholder meeting; and (iv) a $1.9 million net increase in share-based compensation expense primarily attributable to the grant of additional awards under the Stock Incentive Plans, partially offset by certain awards that became fully vested, partially offset by (v) a $4.7 million decrease due to employer payroll taxes for the first quarter of 2024 related to stock options exercised during that quarter; and (vi) a $1.1 million decrease in legal, and professional fees.
Losses (gains) associated with digital assets
Upon adoption of ASU 2023-08 on January 1, 2025, any subsequent increases or decreases in fair value are recognized as incurred in the Consolidated Statements of Operations, and the fair value of our bitcoin is reflected within the Consolidated Balance Sheets each reporting period-end. Since adopting ASU 2023-08, we are no longer required to account for our bitcoin under a cost-less-impairment accounting model and no longer establish a deferred tax asset related to bitcoin impairment losses. Instead, we establish a deferred tax liability if the market value of bitcoin at the reporting date is greater than the average cost basis of our bitcoin holdings at such reporting date, and any subsequent increases or decreases in the market value of bitcoin will increase or decrease the deferred tax liability.

The following table sets forth the unrealized losses (gains) associated with our digital assets (in thousands):
We did not sell any of our digital assets during the three months ended March 31, 2025 or 2024. As a result of our adoption of ASU 2023-08, we may incur greater losses during periods when we previously would have incurred smaller losses or no losses because we had already impaired the carrying value of our bitcoin to a low price observed during a prior period, and we may also incur gains during periods when the market value of bitcoin rises, as compared to periods prior to January 1, 2025, when we would not have incurred any gains under similar circumstances. Accordingly, due in particular to the volatility in the price of bitcoin, we expect the adoption of ASU 2023-08 to increase the volatility of our financial results.  Additionally, as a result of ASU 2023-08 requiring a cumulative-effect adjustment to our opening balance of retained earnings as of January 1, 2025 and not permitting retrospective restatement of prior periods, our future results will not be comparable to results from periods prior to our adoption of the guidance.
Interest Expense, Net
Interest expense, net, primarily relates to the contractual interest expense and amortization of issuance costs related to our long-term debt arrangements. The following table sets forth interest expense, net (in thousands) for the periods indicated:
Interest expense, net, increased $5.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2025, as compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily as a result of (i) interest incurred related to the 2032 Convertible Notes
