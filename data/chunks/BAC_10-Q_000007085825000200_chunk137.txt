the Corporation offering a borrower modified loan terms that reduce their contractual payments temporarily over a
three
-to-
four-month
trial period. If the customer successfully makes the modified payments during the trial period and formally accepts the modified terms, the modified loan terms become permanent. Some borrowers may enter into permanent modifications without a trial period. In a permanent modification, the borrower’s payment terms are typically modified in more than one manner, but generally include a term extension and an interest rate reduction. At times, the permanent modification may also include principal forgiveness and/or a deferral of past due principal and interest amounts to the end of the loan term. The combinations utilized are based on modifying the terms that give the borrower an improved ability to meet the contractual obligations. The term extensions granted for residential mortgage and home equity permanent modifications vary widely and can be up to
30
years, but most are in the range of
1
to
20
years. Principal forgiveness and payment deferrals were insignificant during the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024.
