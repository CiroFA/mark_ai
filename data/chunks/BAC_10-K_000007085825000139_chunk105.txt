The Corporation is committed to equal pay for equal work. We maintain robust policies and practices that reinforce our commitment, including reviews conducted by a third-party consultant with oversight from our Board and senior management.
Physical, Emotional, and Financial Wellness
The Corporation is committed to providing employees with access to leading benefits and programs that help promote their physical, emotional and financial wellness. Investments we make in our teammates are designed to help them thrive, enabling them to better deliver for our clients, communities and each other.
In 2024, we continued our efforts to provide affordable access to healthcare. Teammates enrolled in one of our national medical plans were able to access virtual general medical and behavioral health care at no cost. For the 12th year in a row, U.S. health insurance premiums remained unchanged for teammates earning less than $50,000.
We also recognize the importance of emotional wellness. Globally, teammates and members of their households can utilize our Employee Assistance Programs for 12 in-person confidential counseling sessions, and unlimited phone consultations at no cost. The Corporation also offers comprehensive time-away policies and caregiving benefits. Globally, teammates celebrating at least 15 years of continuous service with the Corporation can participate in our paid Global Sabbatical Program.
We support teammates in reaching financial wellness with retirement savings plans and other programs, along with access to self-guided financial planning tools and expert advice.
