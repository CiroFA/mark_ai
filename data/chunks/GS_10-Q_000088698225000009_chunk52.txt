certain other assets and liabilities;
•
Certain time deposits (deposits with no stated maturity are not eligible for a fair value option election), including structured certificates of deposit, which are hybrid financial instruments;
•
Substantially all other secured financings, including structured financing arrangements and transfers of assets accounted for as financings; and
•
Certain unsecured short- and long-term borrowings, substantially all of which are hybrid financial instruments.
See Note 4 for an overview of the firm’s fair value measurement policies, valuation techniques and significant inputs used to determine the fair value of other financial assets and liabilities, and Note 5 for information about other financial assets and liabilities within the fair value hierarchy.
Gains and Losses on Other Financial Assets and Liabilities Accounted for at Fair Value Under the Fair Value Option
The table below presents the gains and losses recognized in earnings as a result of the election to apply the fair value option to certain financial assets and liabilities.
In the table above:
•
Gains/(losses) were substantially all included in market making.
•
Gains/(losses) exclude contractual interest, which is included in interest income and interest expense, for all instruments other than hybrid financial instruments. See Note 23 for further information about interest income and interest expense.
•
Gains/(losses) included in unsecured short- and long-term borrowings were substantially all related to the embedded derivative component of hybrid financial instruments. These gains and losses would have been recognized under other U.S. GAAP even if the firm had not elected to account for the entire hybrid financial instrument at fair value.
•
Gains/(losses) included in other were primarily related to resale and repurchase agreements, deposits and other secured financings.
•
Other financial assets and liabilities at fair value are frequently economically hedged with trading assets and liabilities. Accordingly, gains or losses on such other financial assets and liabilities can be partially offset by gains or losses on trading assets and liabilities. As a result, gains or losses on other financial assets and liabilities do not necessarily represent the overall impact on the firm’s results of operations, liquidity or capital resources.
