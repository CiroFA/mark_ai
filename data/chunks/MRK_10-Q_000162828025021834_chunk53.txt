Keytruda
is an anti-PD-1 (programmed death receptor-1) therapy that has been approved in over 40 indications in the U.S., including 18 tumor types and 2 tumor-agnostic indications, and has similarly been approved in markets worldwide for many of these indications. The
Keytruda
clinical development program includes studies across a broad range of cancer types. See “Research and Development Update” below.
Global sales of
Keytruda
grew 4% in the first quarter of 2025.
Keytruda
sales growth in the U.S. reflects higher demand and pricing, partially offset by an approximate $250 million negative impact due to the timing of wholesaler purchases. Demand was driven by increased utilization across earlier-stage indications, including in certain types of high-risk early-stage triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), renal cell carcinoma (RCC), and non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), as well as higher demand across the multiple approved metastatic indications, in particular for the treatment of certain types of urothelial and endometrial cancers.
Keytruda
sales growth in international markets reflects higher demand predominately for the TNBC, NSCLC and RCC earlier-stage indications, as well as uptake in gastric, urothelial, and cervical cancer metastatic indications. The 2025 launch and reimbursement of new indications for
Keytruda
in the EU is having a negative impact on pricing in those markets.
