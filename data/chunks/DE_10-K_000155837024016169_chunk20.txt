Banco John Deere S.A.
In August 2024, we entered into a joint venture agreement with a Brazilian bank, Banco Bradesco S.A. (Bradesco), for Bradesco to invest and become
50
percent owner of our wholly-owned subsidiary in Brazil, Banco John Deere S.A. (BJD). BJD is included in our financial services segment and finances retail and wholesale loans for agricultural, construction, and forestry equipment. The transaction is intended to reduce our incremental risk as we continue to grow in the Brazilian market. On the transaction date, which is expected to occur in the first half of 2025, Bradesco will contribute capital equal to our equity investment in BJD. We will retain a
50
percent equity interest in BJD and expect to report the results of the joint venture as an equity investment in unconsolidated affiliates.
The BJD business was reclassified as held for sale in the third quarter of 2024, as the held for sale criteria was met. A reversal of
