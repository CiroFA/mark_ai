7. PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS
We have several funded and unfunded defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans cover U.S. employees and certain foreign employees. The measurement date of our plans is October 31.
The funded status as of October 31, 2024 of the significant plans follows:
​
​
The components of net periodic pension and OPEB (benefit) cost excluding the service cost component are included in the line item “Other operating expenses.”
The components of net periodic pension (benefit) cost and the related assumptions consisted of the following:
​
​
During 2024,
curtailment expense
of $
35
was recognized related to U.S. hourly employee layoffs.
The 2025 net periodic pension benefit is expected to increase by
$
100
due to an increase in the expected long-term rates of return on pension plan assets (estimated to be
7.1
percent) and the U.S. hourly pension curtailment recognized in 2024, described above.

The actuarial loss for pension for 2024 was due to a decrease in discount rates. The actuarial loss for OPEB for 2024 was due to a decrease in discount rates and changes to health care assumptions. The actuarial gain for pension for 2023 was due to an increase in discount rates. The actuarial gain for OPEB for 2023 was due to changes to health care assumptions.

During
2023
, we irrevocably transferred to an insurance company
$
112
of a Canadian pension plan’s defined benefit obligations and related
plan assets
. The transaction resulted in no changes to the benefits to be received by the retired participants. We recognized a one-time, non-cash, pretax pension settlement charge of
$
36
related to the accelerated recognition of actuarial losses included within “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).”
The discount rate assumptions used to determine the pension and OPEB obligations for all periods presented were based on hypothetical AA yield curves represented by a series of annualized individual discount rates. These discount rates represent the rates at which our benefit obligations could effectively be settled at the October 31 measurement
