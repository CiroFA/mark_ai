We based the forward-looking statements on our current expectations, estimates and projections about ourselves and the industries in which we operate in general. We caution you these statements are not guarantees of future performance as they involve assumptions that, while made in good faith, may prove to be incorrect or inaccurate, and involve risks and uncertainties we cannot predict. Accordingly, our actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what we have expressed or forecast in the forward-looking statements. Any differences could result from a variety of factors and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the following:
•
Effects of volatile commodity prices, including prolonged periods of low commodity prices, which may adversely impact our operating results and our ability to execute on our strategy and could result in recognition of impairment charges on our long-lived assets, leaseholds and nonconsolidated equity investments.
•
Global and regional changes in the demand, supply, prices, differentials or other market conditions affecting oil and gas, including changes as a result of any ongoing military conflict and the global response to such conflict; security threats on facilities and infrastructure; global health crises; the imposition or lifting of crude oil production quotas or other actions that might be imposed by OPEC and other producing countries; or the resulting company or third-party actions in response to such changes.
•
The potential for insufficient liquidity or other factors, such as those described herein, that could impact our ability to repurchase shares and declare and pay dividends, whether fixed or variable.
•
Potential failures or delays in achieving expected reserve or production levels from existing and future oil and gas developments, including due to operating hazards, drilling risks and the inherent uncertainties in predicting reserves and reservoir performance.
•
Reductions in our reserve replacement rates, whether as a result of significant declines in commodity prices or otherwise.
•
Unsuccessful exploratory drilling activities or the inability to obtain access to exploratory acreage.
•
Failure to progress or complete announced and future development plans
