announcement of additional capital raising transactions;

•

the volume of shares of our class A common stock and other securities available for public sale;
•
sales or purchases of stock by us or by our stockholders and issuances of awards under our equity incentive plan; and
•
general economic conditions and slow or negative growth of related markets, including as a result of war, terrorism, infectious diseases, natural disasters and other global events, and government responses to such events.
