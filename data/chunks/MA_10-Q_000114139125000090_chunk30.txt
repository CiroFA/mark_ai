PART I
ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Cash Flows
The table below shows a summary of the cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities:
Net cash provided by operating activities increased $708 million for the three months ended March 31, 2025, versus the comparable period in 2024, primarily due to higher net income after adjusting for non-cash items as well as less cash paid for litigation settlements, partially offset by higher employee incentives paid.
Net cash used in investing activities increased $166 million for the three months ended March 31, 2025, versus the comparable period in 2024, primarily due to lower proceeds from maturities of investment securities, partially offset by lower purchases of investment securities.
Net cash used in financing activities increased $306 million for the three months ended March 31, 2025, versus the comparable period in 2024, primarily due to the repayment of debt and higher cash paid for repurchases of our Class A common stock and dividends, partially offset by cash proceeds received from our February 2025 debt issuance.
Debt and Credit Availability
In February 2025, we issued $300 million principal amount of Floating Rate Notes due March 2028, $450 million principal amount of 4.550% notes due March 2028 and $500 million principal amount of 4.950% notes due March 2032 (collectively the “2025 USD Notes”).  The net proceeds from the issuance of the 2025 USD Notes, after deducting the original issue discount, underwriting discount and offering expenses, were $1.242 billion.
In March 2025, $750 million of principal related to the 2019 USD Notes matured and was paid.  Our total debt outstanding at March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024 was $18.8 billion and $18.2 billion, respectively, with the earliest maturity of $750 million of principal occurring in November 2026.
As of March 31, 2025, we have a commercial paper program (the “Commercial Paper Program”), under which we are authorized to issue up to $8 billion in outstanding notes, with maturities up to 397 days from the date of issuance.  In conjunction with the Commercial Paper Program, we have a committed unsecured $8 billion revolving credit facility (the “Credit Facility”) that expires in November 2029.
Borrowings under the Commercial Paper Program and the Credit Facility are to be used to provide liquidity for general corporate purposes, including providing liquidity in the event of one or more settlement failures by our customers.  In addition, we may borrow and repay amounts under these facilities for business continuity purposes.  We had no borrowings outstanding under the Commercial Paper Program or the Credit Facility at March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024.
See Note 9 (Debt) to the consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 for further discussion on our debt and Note 15
