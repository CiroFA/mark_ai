The entire amount of the credit facilities is available for general corporate purposes and to provide additional liquidity in the event of a loss to the companies’ or their subsidiaries’ operating facilities (including, in the case of FPL, a transmission and distribution property loss). FPL’s syndicated revolving credit facilities are also available to support the purchase of $1,663 million of pollution control, solid waste disposal and industrial development revenue bonds in the event they are tendered by individual bondholders and not remarketed prior to maturity as well as the repayment of approximately $1,979 million of floating rate notes in the event an individual noteholder requires repayment at specified dates prior to maturity. As of December 31, 2024, approximately $575 million of FPL's and $5,422 million of NEECH's syndicated revolving credit facilities expire over the next 12 months.
(b)    Only available for the funding of loans. As of December 31, 2024, approximately $925 million of FPL's and $2,600 million of NEECH's bilateral revolving credit facilities expire over the next 12 months.
(c)    Only available for the issuance of letters of credit. As of December 31, 2024, approximately $1,180 million of the letter of credit facilities expire over the next 12 months.
Approximately 74 banks, located globally, participate in FPL’s and NEECH’s revolving credit facilities, with no one bank providing more than 5% of the combined revolving credit facilities. Pursuant to a 1998 guarantee agreement, NEE guarantees the payment of NEECH’s debt obligations under its revolving credit facilities. In order for FPL or NEECH to borrow or to have letters of credit issued under the terms of their respective revolving credit facilities and, also for NEECH, its letter of credit facilities, FPL, in the case of FPL, and NEE, in the case of NEECH, are required, among other things, to maintain a ratio of funded debt to total capitalization that does not exceed a stated ratio. The FPL and NEECH revolving credit facilities also contain default and related acceleration provisions relating to, among other things, failure of FPL and NEE, as the case may be, to maintain the respective ratio of funded debt to total capitalization at or below the specified ratio. At December 31, 2024, each of NEE and FPL was in compliance with its required ratio.
