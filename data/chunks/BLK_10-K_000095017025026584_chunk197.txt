BlackRock is subject to US federal income tax, state and local income tax, and foreign income tax in multiple jurisdictions. Tax years after 2015 remain open to US federal income tax examination.
During 2020 and 2021, the Internal Revenue Service commenced its examination of BlackRock’s 2017 through 2018 tax years and 2019 tax year, respectively. During 2023, the Internal Revenue Service commenced its examination of BlackRock’s 2016 tax year.
The Company is currently under audit in several state and local jurisdictions. The significant state and local income tax examinations are in New York State for tax years 2015 through 2020, and New York City for tax years 2012 through 2014. No open state and local tax examinations cover years earlier than 2012.
Upon conclusion of its examination, Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs (“HMRC”) issued a closure notice during 2017 for various UK BlackRock subsidiaries for tax years 2009 and years after. At that time, the Company decided to pursue litigation for the tax matters included on such notice. During 2020, the Company received a favorable decision from the First Tier Tribunal (“FTT”), however, HMRC appealed to the Upper Tribunal (“UT”) and the UT ruled in HMRC’s favor, overturning the FTT’s decision in July 2022. BlackRock appealed the UT’s decision to the UK Court of Appeal, who dismissed the Company's appeal. The Company applied for permission to appeal to the UK Supreme Court, who refused permission to appeal in October 2024. The resolution did not result in a material impact to the consolidated financial statements.
From time to time, BlackRock may receive or be subject to tax authorities’ assessments and challenges related to income taxes. BlackRock does not currently expect the ultimate resolution of any other existing matters to be material to the consolidated financial statements.
