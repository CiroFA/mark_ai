Our global headquarters are located in New York City.

In many locations, our business and operations are co-located to achieve synergy and operational efficiencies. We continue to advance our global workplace strategy to provide workplaces that promote our forward-thinking and highly inclusive culture. As of December 31, 2024, we had 251 owned and leased properties worldwide, amounting to approximately 37 million square feet.
As of December 31, 2024, PGS had responsibility for 37 plants around the world, which manufacture products for our commercial divisions, including in Belgium, Germany, India, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Singapore and the U.S. The leadership team for PGS is primarily located in New York City. PGS also operates multiple distribution facilities around the world. PGS continuously evaluates it network and capacity to meet Pfizer's ever changing needs and help inform future decisions.
