of our counterparties. Should a
counterparty default, our maximum loss exposure is the asset
balance of the instrument. We have not changed our hedging
strategies, accounting practices or objectives from those
disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for
2024
.
We had
€
2.3
billion
at
March 31, 2025
and
December 31, 2024
in
certain forward currency contracts designated as net investment
hedges,
for which the maximum term is
9
.5 years
,
to hedge a
portion of our investments in certain of our entities with functional
currencies denominated in Euros. In addition to these derivative
financial instruments designated as net investment hedges, we
had
€
5.0
billion
at
March 31, 2025
and
December 31, 2024
of
senior unsecured notes designated as net investment hedges to
selectively hedge portions of our investment in certain
international subsidiaries. The currency effects of our Euro-
denominated senior unsecured notes are reflected in AOCI within
shareholders' equity where they offset gains and losses recorded
on our net investment in international subsidiaries.
The total after-tax gain (loss) recognized in OCI related to
designated net investment hedges was
($
218
)
in the
three
months 2025
.
Currency Exchange Rate Gains (Losses) Recognized in Net
Earnings
Pretax gains (losses) on derivatives designated as cash flow
hedges of
$
13
and net investment hedges of
$
40
recorded in
AOCI are expected to be reclassified to cost of sales and other
income (expense), net in earnings within 12 months of
March 31,
2025
.
This cash flow hedge reclassification is primarily due to the
sale of inventory that includes previously hedged purchases. A
component of the AOCI amounts related to net investment
hedges is reclassified over the life of the hedge instruments as
we elected to exclude the initial value of the component related to
the spot-forward difference from the effectiveness assessment.
Interest Rate Hedges
Pretax gains (losses) of
$
3
recorded in AOCI related to interest
rate hedges closed in conjunction with debt issuances are
expected to be reclassified to other income (expense), net in
earnings within 12 months of
March 31, 2025
.
The cash flow
effect of interest rate hedges is recorded in cash flow from
operations.
NOTE 5 -
FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS
Our policies for managing risk related to foreign currency, interest
rates, credit and markets and our process for determining fair
value have not changed from those described in our Annual
Report on Form 10-K for
2024
.
In the
three months 2025
we assumed contingent consideration
liabilities with a fair value of
$
90
related to previous acquisitions
made by Inari Medical Inc. (Inari). Refer to Note 7 for further
information on the acquisition of Inari.
In
2024
we recorded
$
208
of contingent consideration related to
various acquisitions described in Note 7.
There were no significant transfers into or out of any level of the
fair value hierarchy in
2025
.
On
March 31, 2025
