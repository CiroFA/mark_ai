obligations of approximately $
31
billion and $
30
billion as of February 28, 2025 and August 31, 2024, respectively. Our remaining performance obligations represent the amount of transaction price for which work has not been performed and revenue has not been recognized. The majority of our contracts are terminable by the client on short notice with little or no termination penalties, and some without notice. Under Topic 606, only the non-cancelable portion of these contracts is included in our performance obligations. Additionally, our performance obligations only include variable consideration if we assess it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty is resolved. Based on the terms of our contracts, a significant portion of what we consider contract bookings is not included in our remaining performance obligations. We expect to recognize approximately
50
% of our remaining performance obligations as of February 28, 2025 as revenue in fiscal 2025, an additional
26
% in fiscal 2026, and the balance thereafter.
Contract Estimates
Adjustments in contract estimates related to performance obligations satisfied or partially satisfied in prior periods were immaterial for the three and six months ended February 28, 2025 and February 29, 2024, respectively.
Contract Balances
Deferred transition revenues were $
638,448
and $
641,091
as of February 28, 2025 and August 31, 2024, respectively, and are included in Non-current deferred revenues. Costs related to these activities are also deferred and are expensed as the services are provided. Deferred transition costs were $
929,143
and $
862,140
as of February 28, 2025 and August 31, 2024, respectively, and are included in Deferred contract costs. Generally, deferred transition costs are recoverable under the contract in the event of early termination and are monitored regularly for impairment. Impairment losses are recorded when projected remaining undiscounted operating cash flows of the related contract are not sufficient to recover the carrying amount of contract assets.
The following table provides information about the balances of our Receivables and Contract assets, net of allowance, and Contract liabilities (Deferred revenues):
