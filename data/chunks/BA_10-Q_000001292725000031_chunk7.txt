Liabilities, Commitments and Contingencies
737 MAX Customer Concessions and Other Considerations
During the first quarter of 2024, we recorded an earnings charge of $
443
, net of insurance recoveries, in connection with estimated considerations to customers for disruption related to the January 2024 737-9 door plug accident and 737-9 grounding. This charge is reflected in the financial statements as a reduction to Sales of products.
The following table summarizes changes in the 737 MAX customer concessions and other considerations liability during the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024.
At March 31, 2025, $
92
of the liability balance remains subject to negotiations with customers. The contracted amount includes $
109
expected to be paid in cash primarily in 2025, while the remaining amounts are primarily expected to be liquidated by lower customer delivery payments.
Environmental
The following table summarizes changes in environmental remediation liabilities during the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024.
The liabilities recorded represent our best estimate or the low end of a range of reasonably possible costs expected to be incurred to remediate sites, including operation and maintenance over periods of up to
30
years. It is reasonably possible that we may incur costs that exceed these recorded amounts because of regulatory agency orders and directives, changes in laws and/or regulations, higher than expected costs and/or the discovery of new or additional contamination. As part of our estimating process, we develop a range of reasonably possible alternate scenarios that includes the high end of a range of reasonably possible cost estimates for all remediation sites for which we have sufficient information based on our experience and existing laws and regulations. There are some potential remediation obligations where the costs of remediation cannot be reasonably estimated. At March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, the high end of the estimated range of reasonably possible remediation costs exceeded our recorded liabilities by $
996
and $
1,002

Commercial Aircraft Trade-In Commitments
In conjunction with signing definitive agreements for the sale of new aircraft, we have entered into trade-in commitments with certain customers that give them the right to trade in used aircraft at a specified price. The probability that trade-in commitments will be exercised is determined by using both quantitative information from valuation sources and qualitative information from other sources. The probability of exercise is assessed quarterly, or as events trigger a change, and takes into consideration the current economic
