In March 2024, the jury for the second James case damages phase trial awarded
ten
plaintiffs $
42
million of damages, including $
12
million of doubled economic damages and $
30
million of noneconomic and punitive damages. In May 2024, the Multnomah Court granted PacifiCorp’s request to offset the damage awards by deducting insurance proceeds received by any of the
ten
plaintiffs. In June 2024, the Multnomah Court entered a limited judgment and money award of $
38
million for the March 2024 James verdict, based on the aggregate amounts awarded, offset by insurance proceeds received by plaintiffs.
The January, April and June 2024 limited judgments created liens against PacifiCorp, attaching a debt for the money awards. In each instance, PacifiCorp posted a supersedeas bond, which stays any effort to seek payment of the judgment pending final resolution of any appeals. Under ORS 82.010, interest at a rate of
9
% per annum will accrue on the judgment commencing at the date the judgment was entered until the entire money award is paid, amended or reversed by an appellate court. PacifiCorp amended its January 2024 appeal of the June 2023 James verdict to include the January 2024 jury verdict and further amended its appeal of the June 2023 verdict to include the March 2024 jury verdict. PacifiCorp’s opening brief is due to be filed with the Oregon Court of Appeals on or before February 25, 2025, in connection with its appeal of the June 2023 James verdict and the January and March 2024 verdicts for the first two James damages phase trials.
In February 2025, the jury for the third James case damages phase trial awarded
seven
plaintiffs $
32
million of noneconomic damages in addition to $
4
million of economic damages stipulated for
eight
plaintiffs prior to the trial. In accordance with Oregon law, plaintiffs asked the court to double the economic damages to $
8
million after the verdict. PacifiCorp expects the court will award the doubling of economic damages and also increase the award for $
9
million in punitive damages by applying the
0.25
multiplier of economic and noneconomic
