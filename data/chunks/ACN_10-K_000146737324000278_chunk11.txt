carbon reduction in support of our goals includes:
•
Maintaining 100%
renewable electricity.
In 2023, we achieved our goal of 100% renewable electricity in our facilities and we maintained this in fiscal 2024. As we do not own our facilities and procure most of our energy from the grid, we purchase renewable electricity contracts equivalent to the amount of electricity we consume. Going forward, we plan to maintain 100% renewable electricity in our facilities. As we purchase renewable electricity, we also support the generation of more renewable sources of electricity.
•
Enabling low carbon business travel.
We continue to use technology to facilitate more cost and carbon-efficient delivery for our clients and our business and have implemented an internal carbon price on travel to encourage climate smart travel decisions. In addition, we have developed analytics and reporting focused on our business travel emissions so that we can share emissions data with our clients as part of our delivery activities.
•
Engaging our suppliers.
We are working with our suppliers to reduce our Scope 3 emissions. Our goal is that 90% of our key suppliers disclose their environmental targets and the actions being taken to reduce emissions by the end of 2025. We are on track to meet this goal, with 89% of key suppliers disclosing their targets and 96% disclosing the actions they are taking to reduce their emissions. Key suppliers are defined as vendors that represent a significant portion of our 2019 Scope 3 emissions.
Carbon Removal
•
Nature-based carbon removal.
To address our remaining emissions, we are investing in nature-based carbon removal projects to remove carbon from the atmosphere. We plan to begin applying carbon removal credits in fiscal 2025. Our
nature-based carbon removal projects will also support and respect the universal principles of the UNGC in the relevant areas of human rights, labor, environment, anticorruption and the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
Moving Toward Zero Waste
•
Addressing e-waste and office furniture.
We have a goal of reusing or recycling 100% of our e-waste, such as computers and servers, as well as all our office furniture, by the end of 2025. During fiscal 2024, we reused or recycled nearly 100% of our e-waste relating to computers, servers and uninterruptible power supply devices. We continue to refine our processes, leverage our asset tracking system and work with vendors to help us extend the life cycle of our furniture, including through refurbishment and reuse or recycling.
•
Eliminate single-use plastics in our office locations.
During fiscal 2024, we continued to meet our goal of eliminating single-use plastics in our office locations by purchasing reusable and plastic-free items.
Planning for Water Risk
•
Mitigating the potential impacts of climate change-related water risk.
Although Accenture is not a water-intensive company, to safeguard our people and operations we are developing water resiliency action
