Insurance—Underwriting
Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group
Life/health
A summary of our life/health reinsurance underwriting results follows (dollars in millions).
Premiums written and earned in the first quarter of 2025 were substantially unchanged from 2024. Pre-tax underwriting earnings in the first quarter of 2025 declined $38 million, reflecting the impact of life contract commutation gains of $51 million in the first quarter of 2024 and increased losses from U.S. long-term care business, partially offset by increased earnings from other life business.
Retroactive reinsurance
We have written no significant new retroactive reinsurance contracts over the past several years. Pre-tax underwriting results derive from changes in the ultimate claim liability estimates and changes in the related deferred charge assets, as well as from foreign currency exchange gains and losses attributable to non-U.S. Dollar denominated contracts. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates produced losses of $40 million in the first quarter of 2025 and gains of $45 million in 2024. Pre-tax underwriting losses before foreign currency exchange gains were $169 million in the first quarter of 2025 and $192 million in 2024.
Unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses for retroactive reinsurance contracts declined $469 million in the first quarter of 2025 to $32.0 billion at March 31, 2025, primarily due to loss payments. Deferred charge assets on retroactive reinsurance contracts declined $169 million in the first quarter of 2025 to $8.6 billion at March 31, 2025. Deferred charge balances will be charged to earnings over the expected remaining claims settlement periods.
Periodic payment annuity
Periodic payment annuity business is price and demand sensitive, and the supply of available business is affected by the timing of underlying legal claim settlements. Premium rates for new business continue to be at unacceptable levels. We have written no new business since 2022.
Pre-tax underwriting losses from periodic payment annuity contracts in each period included the accretion of discounted liabilities and includes liabilities for contracts without life contingencies, as well as foreign currency exchange gains and losses on non-U.S.
