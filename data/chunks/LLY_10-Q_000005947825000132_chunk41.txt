FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY
We believe our available cash and cash equivalents, together with our ability to generate operating cash flow and our access to short-term and long-term borrowings, are sufficient to fund our existing and planned capital requirements. For a discussion of our capital requirements, see "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition" in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on
Form 10-K
for the year ended December 31, 2024.
We are making investments in global facilities to manufacture existing and future products. These investments, and other capital investments that support our operations, have increased our capital expenditures and will result in meaningfully higher capital expenditures over the next several years.
As we expand our manufacturing capacity in order to meet existing and expected demand of our medicines, we have entered, and expect to continue to enter, into various agreements for contract manufacturing and for supply of materials. Executed agreements related to our medicines in development could, under certain circumstances, require us to pay up to approximately $8 billion if we do not purchase specified amounts of goods or services over the durations of the agreements, which are generally up to 8 years.
Cash and cash equivalents decreased to $3.09 billion as of March 31, 2025, compared with $3.27 billion as of December 31, 2024. Refer to the consolidated condensed statements of cash flows for additional information on the significant sources and uses of cash for the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024.
In addition to our cash and cash equivalents, we held total investments of $3.35 billion and $3.37 billion as of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively. See Note 6 to the consolidated condensed financial statements for additional information.

As of March 31, 2025, total debt was $38.52 billion, an increase of $4.87 billion compared with $33.64 billion as of December 31, 2024. In February 2025, we issued $6.50 billion of fixed-rate notes and used the net cash proceeds to fund the acquisition of Scorpion's PI3Kα inhibitor program STX-478 and related fees and expenses and for general business purposes, including the repayment of outstanding commercial paper. See Note 6 to the consolidated condensed financial statements for additional information.
As of March 31, 2025, we had a total of $8.42 billion of unused committed bank credit facilities, $8.00 billion of which is available to support our commercial
