Distribution & Sales
Our main types of distribution and sales are tailored to the characteristics of each market and are often used simultaneously:

Direct sales and distribution, where we sell directly to the retailers;

Distribution through independent distributors that often distribute other fast-moving consumer goods and are responsible for distribution in a particular market;

Exclusive zonified distribution, where the dedicated multicategory product distributors are assigned to exclusive territories within a market;

Distribution through national or regional wholesalers that then supply the retail trade;
•
Our own e-commerce infrastructure for product sales to trade partners and to consumers; and
•

Competition
We are subject to highly competitive conditions in all aspects of our business. We compete primarily on the basis of product quality, brand recognition, brand loyalty, taste, R&D, innovation, packaging, customer service, marketing, advertising and retail price.
The competitive environment and our competitive position can be significantly influenced by weak economic conditions; erosion of consumer confidence; competitors' introduction of lower-price products or innovative products; adult smoker willingness to convert to our SFPs; higher product taxes; higher absolute prices and larger gaps between retail price categories; and product regulation that diminishes the ability to differentiate tobacco products, restricts adult consumer access to truthful and non-misleading information about
