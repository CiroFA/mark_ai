respectively. After considering the deferred tax accounting impact, it is expected that about $
425
million of the total as of December 31, 2024 would favorably affect the effective tax rate if resolved in the Company’s favor.
The following table presents a reconciliation of the beginning and ending amounts of unrecognized tax benefits:
(1)
Of this amount, $
421
million and $
319
million are included in Long-term income taxes for 2024 and 2023, respectively, and $
40
million and $
269
million are included in Income taxes for 2024 and 2023, respectively, on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
The Company is currently under audit with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS") for tax years 2011 through 2012 and 2016 through 2021. As of December 31, 2024, the IRS examination for tax years 2011 and 2012 are awaiting final resolution with the IRS appeals team. Examination years 2016 through 2021 remain open as of the end of the period.
The Company is also under audit in multiple foreign tax jurisdictions, primarily related to transfer pricing, as well as multiple state tax jurisdictions. While the Company cannot estimate the impact to the effective tax rate, it is reasonably possible that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits could decrease up to $
45
million within the next 12 months. This would be due to the possible resolution of the aforementioned U.S. Federal, foreign and U.S. state tax audits and the expiration of the statute of limitations in multiple tax jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state and local, or non-U.S. income tax examinations for years before 2009.
During 2024, the Company finalized and settled certain tax examinations and remeasured other income tax reserves based on audit progression.  It is reasonably possible that, as a result of audit progression in both the U.S. and foreign tax audits within the next 12 months, there may be new information that causes the Company to reassess the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits recorded. While the Company cannot estimate the impact that new information may have on the unrecognized tax benefit balance, it believes that the liabilities recorded are appropriate and adequate.
The Company accrued $
17
million and $
25
million for interest and penalties related to tax matters at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Costs recognized for interest and penalties related to tax matters in 2024 and 2023 were immaterial and $
91
million in 2022. These amounts are included in the provision for income taxes.
As of December 31, 2024, the Company has accumulated undistributed earnings generated by its foreign subsidiaries, which were predominantly taxed in the U.S. as a result of the transition tax provisions enacted under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. Management does not assert that these previously-taxed unremitted earnings are indefinitely reinvested in operations outside the U.S. Accordingly, the Company has provided deferred
