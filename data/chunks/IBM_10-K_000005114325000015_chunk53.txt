Computer hackers and others routinely attack the security of technology products, services, systems and networks, like those we offer, using a wide variety of methods, including ransomware or other malicious software and attempts to exploit vulnerabilities in hardware, software, and infrastructure, and the increased use of generative AI may introduce novel methods of attack. Attacks also include social engineering and cyber extortion to induce customers, contractors, business partners, vendors, employees and other third parties to disclose information, transfer funds, or unwittingly provide access to systems or data. The company is at risk of security breaches not only of our own products, services, systems and networks, but also those of customers, contractors, business partners, vendors, employees and other third parties, particularly as all parties increasingly digitize their operations. Cyber threats are increasing in number and sophistication, continually evolving, including with the increased use of AI, making it difficult to anticipate and defend against such threats and vulnerabilities that can persist undetected over extended periods of time.
The companyâ€™s products, services, systems and networks, including cloud-based systems and systems and technologies that the company maintains on behalf of its customers, are used in critical company, customer or third-party operations, and involve the storage, processing and transmission of sensitive data, including valuable intellectual property, other proprietary or confidential data, regulated data, and personal information of employees, customers and others. These products, services, systems and networks are also used by customers in heavily regulated industries, including those in the financial services, healthcare, critical infrastructure and government sectors.
As is common in our industry and for a company our size, we continue to face and prepare for cybersecurity threats. While the company continues to monitor for, identify, investigate, respond to and remediate a wide range of cybersecurity events, there have not been cybersecurity incidents or vulnerabilities that have had a material adverse effect on the company, though there is no assurance that there will not be cybersecurity incidents or vulnerabilities that will have a material adverse effect in the future.
The company regularly addresses cybersecurity attacks and vulnerabilities. Cybersecurity attacks or other security incidents, including industry-wide incidents such as MOVEit, have or could result in, for example, one or more of the following: unauthorized access to, disclosure, modification, misuse, loss, or destruction of company, customer, or other third-party data or systems; theft or import or export of sensitive, regulated, or confidential data including personal information and intellectual property, including key innovations in AI, quantum, or other disruptive technologies; the loss of access to critical data or systems
