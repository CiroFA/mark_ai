weaker global soda ash market, and a soft housing market along with ongoing tariff uncertainties that drove declines in lumber. Partially offsetting some of the volume declines was strength in rock, industrial chemicals, and plastics.
Premium
– Premium includes shipments of finished automobiles, automotive parts, and merchandise in intermodal containers, both domestic and international. Premium freight revenues increased in the first quarter of 2025 compared to 2024 due to a 13% rise in volume and core pricing gains, partially offset by business mix and lower fuel surcharge revenues. The volume increase was primarily due to continued elevated U.S. West Coast imports in the first quarter of 2025, reflecting a 33% increase compared to the first quarter of 2024. In addition, business development efforts in domestic intermodal contributed to year-over-year volume growth. Automotive shipments decreased in the first quarter of 2025 compared to 2024 due to reduced production and tariff uncertainties, which offset some of the volume gains from intermodal shipments.
Mexico business
– Freight revenues from each of our commodity groups includes revenues from shipments to and from Mexico, which decreased 9% to $719 million in the first quarter of 2025 compared to 2024 driven by a 5% volume decline and a 4% decrease in ARC. Volume declines were driven by lower automotive shipments in both parts and finished vehicles.
Operating expenses decreased slightly in the first quarter of 2025 compared to 2024 driven by productivity and lower fuel prices. These decreases were partially offset by volume-related costs, inflation, and higher depreciation.
Compensation and benefits
– Compensation and benefits include wages, payroll taxes, health and welfare costs, pension costs, and incentive costs. For the first quarter of 2025, expense decreased 1% compared to 2024 due to lower employee levels, partially offset by wage inflation.
Purchased services and materials
– Expense for purchased services and materials includes the costs of services purchased from outside contractors and other service providers (including equipment maintenance and contract expense incurred by our subsidiaries for external transportation services); materials used to maintain the Railroad’s lines, structures, and equipment; costs of operating facilities jointly used by UPRR and other railroads; transportation and lodging for train crew employees; trucking and contracting costs for intermodal containers; leased automobile maintenance expense; and tools and supplies. Purchased services and materials increased 3% in the first quarter of 2025 compared to 2024, driven by inflation, volume-related costs (including an increase in our active locomotive fleet), and a 2024 favorable contract settlement, partially offset by decreased volume-related drayage costs incurred at one of our subsidiaries.
Depreciation
– The majority of depreciation relates to road property, including rail, ties, ballast, and other
