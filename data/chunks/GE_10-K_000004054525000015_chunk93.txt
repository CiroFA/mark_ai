stock units (RSU) provide an employee with the right to receive one share of GE Aerospace stock when the restrictions lapse over the vesting period. Upon vesting, each RSU is converted into
one
share of GE Aerospace common stock for each unit. Performance stock units (PSU) and performance shares provide an employee with the right to receive shares of GE Aerospace stock based upon achievement of certain performance or market metrics. Upon vesting, each PSU earned is converted into shares of GE Aerospace common stock. We value stock options using a Black-Scholes option pricing model, RSUs using market price on grant date, and PSUs and performance shares using market price on grant date and a Monte Carlo simulation as needed based on performance metrics.
