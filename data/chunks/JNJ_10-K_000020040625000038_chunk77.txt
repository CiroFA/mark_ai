counterparties establishing collateral thresholds based on respective credit ratings and netting agreements. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details on credit support agreements.
The Company invests in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning securities which carry a degree of interest rate risk. The fair market value of fixed rate securities may be adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than predicted if interest rates fall. A 1% (100 basis points) change in spread on the Company’s interest rate sensitive investments would either increase or decrease the unrealized value of cash equivalents and current marketable securities by less than $8.0 million.
The Company has access to substantial sources of funds at numerous banks worldwide. In June 2024, the Company secured a new 364-day Credit Facility of $10 billion, which expires on June 25, 2025. Interest charged on borrowings under the credit line agreement is based on either Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) Reference Rate or other applicable market rate as allowed plus applicable margins. Commitment fees under the agreement are not material.
Total borrowings at the end of 2024 and 2023 were $36.6 billion and $29.3 billion, respectively. The increase in the borrowings was due to the issuance of new debt in 2024. In 2024, net debt (cash and current marketable securities, net of debt) was $12.1 billion compared to net debt of $6.4 billion in 2023. Total debt represented 34.0% of total capital (shareholders’ equity and total debt) in 2024 and 30.0% of total capital in 2023. Shareholders’ equity per share at the end of 2024 was $29.70 compared to $28.57 at year-end 2023.
A summary of borrowings can be found in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
