associate, job applicant, business partner, and Company information are not successful, we could incur substantial costs and reputational damage and could become subject to litigation and enforcement actions.
Our business, like that of most retailers, involves the collection, use, retention, management, transmission, and deletion of personal information (including identifiers, localization, internet activity, preferences, and payment information) from our customers, associates, job applicants, and business partners, as well as confidential Company information. We also work with third-party service providers that provide technology, systems and services that we use in connection with the handling of information. Our information systems, and those of our third-party service providers, are vulnerable to continually evolving data protection and cybersecurity risks. Unauthorized parties, including criminal threat actors, nation-states, or insiders (including associates or contractors engaged in fraudulent or malicious activities), have in the past gained access, and will continue to attempt to gain access, to these systems and data through technical vulnerabilities, breach of security policies, fraud or other means of deceiving or coercing our associates, contractors or third-party service providers, which could jeopardize the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of such information systems or data that we may handle. Hardware, software or applications we develop or obtain from third parties may contain, and on occasion have contained, exploitable vulnerabilities, bugs, or defects in design, maintenance or manufacture or other problems that could unexpectedly compromise information security. We have experienced and continue to face the ongoing risk of exploitation of our software providers and our software development and implementation process, including from coding and process vulnerabilities and the installation of so-called back doors that provide unauthorized access to systems and data, and through unauthorized access to or theft of our intellectual property. The continued availability of remote or hybrid working arrangements has also expanded the possible attack surface areas and increased risks posed by insider threats, as our interactions with associates, contractors and third-party service providers increasingly occur on information systems, networks and environments over which we have less control and which may be more difficult to monitor. In addition, the risk of cyber-attacks has increased in connection with geopolitical conflicts and ongoing trade and diplomatic tensions. In light of the conflicts in Europe and the Middle East and other geopolitical events, nation-state actors or their supporters and other politically-motivated actors may launch retaliatory cyber-attacks, and may attempt to cause supply chain and other third-party service provider disruptions, or take other geopolitically-motivated retaliatory actions that may
