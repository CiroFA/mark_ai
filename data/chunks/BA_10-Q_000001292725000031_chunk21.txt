eliminating defects, and enhancing our safety and quality culture.
The 737-9 door plug accident and the resulting actions to improve compliance with our manufacturing quality control requirements have significantly impacted our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
On November 4, 2024, the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers District 751 (IAM 751) voted to ratify a new contract, thereby ending the work stoppage initiated on September 13, 2024, which paused production of certain commercial aircraft models (737, 767, 777 and 777X aircraft) as well as production of commercial derivative aircraft for our Defense, Space & Security business (KC-46A Tanker and P-8A Poseidon). Production for all programs resumed in December 2024 and gradually ramped up during the first quarter of 2025.

Revenues
The following table summarizes Revenues:
Revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2025, increased by $2,927 million compared with the same period in 2024 driven by higher revenues at Commercial Airplanes (BCA) and Global Services (BGS), partially offset by lower revenues at Defense, Space & Security (BDS). BCA revenues increased by $3,494 million primarily due to higher deliveries and the absence of 737-9 customer considerations. BGS revenues increased by $18 million primarily due to higher government services revenue, partially offset by lower commercial services revenue. BDS revenues decreased by $652 million primarily driven by lower volume and the absence of a favorable MQ-25 contract modification that was awarded in the first quarter of 2024, partially offset by lower net unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments compared to the comparable period in the prior year.
Revenues will continue to be significantly impacted until deliveries ramp up, the global supply chain stabilizes, and labor instability diminishes.
