Citi’s net interest income in the first quarter of 2025 was $14.0 billion, on both a reported and taxable equivalent basis, an increase of 4%, or $0.5 billion, from the prior-year period. The increases were primarily driven by an 18%, or $0.3 billion, increase in
Markets
net interest income and a 2%, or $0.2 billion, increase in non
-Markets
net interest income
.
The increase in
Markets
net interest income was primarily driven by lower funding costs, as well as higher trading inventory in Fixed Income Markets, partially offset by lower net interest income from structured notes due to lower interest rates.
The increase in non-
Markets
net interest income was largely due to loan growth in Branded Cards and higher deposit spreads in Retail Banking in
USPB
, as well as higher deposit spreads in
Wealth
and
Services
. The impact of these drivers was partially offset by lower net interest income in
All Other
, driven by Mexican peso depreciation and a decrease in Corporate Treasury investment securities.
Citi’s net interest margin was 2.47% on a taxable equivalent basis in the first quarter of 2025, an increase from 2.42% in the prior quarter, largely driven by a more favorable asset mix and higher
