Additional Consumer Credit Details
Consumer Loan Delinquencies Amounts and Ratios
(1)
End-of-period (EOP) loans include interest and fees on credit cards.
(2)
The ratios of 90+ days past due and 30–89 days past due are calculated based on EOP loans, net of unearned income.
(3)
Excludes EOP classifiably managed Private Bank loans. These loans are not included in the delinquency numerator, denominator and ratios.
(4)
These loans are evaluated for non-accrual status and write-off primarily based on their internal risk classification and not solely on their delinquency status, and, therefore, delinquency metrics are excluded from this table. As of December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, 72%, 85% and 96% of
Wealth
classifiably managed loans were rated investment grade. For additional information on the credit quality of the
Wealth
portfolio, including classifiably managed portfolios, see “Consumer Credit Trends” above.
(5)
The 90+ days past due and 30–89 days past due and related ratios for
Retail Banking exclude loans guaranteed by U.S. government-sponsored agencies since the potential risk of loss predominantly resides with the U.S. government-sponsored agencies. The amounts excluded for loans 90+ days past due and (EOP loans) were $69 million ($0.5 billion), $63 million ($0.5 billion) and $89 million ($0.6 billion) at December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The amounts excluded for loans 30–89 days past due (the 30–89 days past due EOP loans have the same adjustments as the 90+ days past due EOP loans) were $66 million, $73 million and $70 million at December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The EOP loans in the table include the guaranteed loans.

The 90+ days past due balances for Branded Cards and Retail Services are generally still accruing interest. Citi’s policy is generally to accrue interest on credit card loans until 180 days past due, unless notification of bankruptcy filing has been received earlier.
