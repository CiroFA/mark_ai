Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratio
Citi’s Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) Capital ratio under the Basel III Standardized Approach was 13.4% as of March 31, 2025, compared to 13.6% as of December 31, 2024, relative to a required regulatory CET1 Capital ratio of 12.1% as of such dates under the Standardized Approach. Citi’s CET1 Capital ratio under the Basel III Advanced Approaches was 11.9% as of March 31, 2025, compared to 12.1% as of December 31, 2024, relative to a required regulatory CET1 Capital ratio of 10.5% as of such dates under the Advanced Approaches framework.
Citi’s CET1 Capital ratio decreased under both the Standardized Approach and Advanced Approaches framework from December 31, 2024, driven primarily by the payment of common and preferred dividends, common share repurchases, increases in Standardized Approach RWA and Advanced Approaches RWA and higher deferred tax assets, partially offset by net income.
