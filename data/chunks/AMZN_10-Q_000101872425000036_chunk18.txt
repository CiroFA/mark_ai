and $(47) million for Q1 2024 and Q1 2025. Cash inflows from financing activities resulted from proceeds from short-term debt, and other and long-term debt of $338 million and $2.6 billion for Q1 2024 and Q1 2025. Cash outflows from financing activities resulted from payments of short-term debt, and other, long-term debt, finance leases, and financing obligations of $1.6 billion and $2.6 billion in Q1 2024 and Q1 2025. Property and equipment acquired under finance leases was $42 million and $54 million during Q1 2024 and Q1 2025.
We had no borrowings outstanding under the two unsecured revolving credit facilities or the commercial paper programs as of March 31, 2025. See Item 1 of Part I, “Financial Statements — Note 5 — Debt” for additional information.
Certain foreign subsidiary earnings and losses are subject to current U.S. taxation and the subsequent repatriation of those earnings is not subject to tax in the U.S. We intend to invest substantially all of our foreign subsidiary earnings, as well as our capital in our foreign subsidiaries, indefinitely outside of the U.S. in those jurisdictions in which we would incur significant, additional costs upon repatriation of such amounts.
Our U.S. taxable income is reduced by accelerated depreciation deductions and increased by the impact of capitalized research and development expenses. U.S. tax rules provide for enhanced accelerated depreciation deductions by allowing us to expense a portion of qualified property, primarily equipment. These enhanced deductions are scheduled to phase out annually from 2023 through 2026. Additionally, effective January 1, 2022, research and development expenses are required to be capitalized and amortized for U.S. tax purposes, which delays the deductibility of these expenses. Cash paid for U.S. (federal and state) and foreign income taxes (net of refunds) totaled $458 million and $877 million for Q1 2024 and Q1 2025.
As of December 31, 2024 and March 31, 2025, restricted cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $3.5 billion and $3.7 billion. See Item 1 of Part I, “Financial Statements — Note 4 — Commitments and Contingencies” and “Financial Statements — Note 5 — Debt” for additional discussion of our principal contractual commitments, as well as our pledged assets. Additionally, we have purchase obligations and open purchase orders, including for inventory and capital expenditures, that support normal operations and are primarily due in the next twelve months. These purchase obligations and open purchase orders are generally cancellable in full or in part through the contractual provisions.
We believe that cash flows generated from operations and our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances, as well as our borrowing arrangements, will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs for at least the next twelve months. However, any projections of future cash needs and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty. See
