lending-related commitments being risk-managed are accounted for on an accrual basis. This asymmetry in accounting treatment, between loans and lending-related commitments and the credit derivatives used in credit portfolio management activities, causes earnings volatility that is not representative, in the Firm’s view, of the true changes in value of the Firm’s overall credit exposure.
The effectiveness of credit default swaps (“CDS”) as a hedge against the Firm’s exposures may vary depending on a number of factors, including the named reference entity (i.e., the Firm may experience losses on specific exposures that are different than the named reference entities in the purchased CDS); the contractual terms of the CDS (which may have a defined credit event that does not align with an actual loss realized by the Firm); and the maturity of the Firm’s CDS protection (which in some cases may be shorter than the Firm’s exposures). However, the Firm generally seeks to purchase credit protection with a maturity date that is the same or similar to the maturity date of the exposure for which the protection was purchased, and remaining differences in maturity are actively monitored and managed by the Firm. Refer to Credit derivatives in Note 5 for further information on credit derivatives and derivatives used in credit portfolio management activities.
The Firm’s allowance for credit losses represents management's estimate of expected credit losses over the remaining expected life of the Firm's financial assets measured at amortized cost and certain off-balance sheet lending-related commitments. The Firm's allowance for credit losses generally consists of:
•
the allowance for loan losses, which covers the Firm’s retained loan portfolios (scored and risk-rated) and is presented separately on the Consolidated balance sheets,
•
the allowance for lending-related commitments, which is reflected in accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets, and
•
the allowance for credit losses on investment securities, which is reflected in investment securities on the Consolidated balance sheets.
Discussion of changes in the allowance
The allowance for credit losses as of December 31, 2024 was $26.9 billion, reflecting a net addition of $2.1 billion from December 31, 2023.
The net addition to the allowance for credit losses included:
•
$2.1 billion in
consumer
, reflecting:
–
a $2.2 billion net addition in Card Services, predominantly driven by loan growth, reflecting higher revolving balances, including the seasoning of vintages originated in recent years,
partially offset by
–
a $125 million net reduction in Home Lending in the first quarter of 2024, and
•
a net reduction of $30 million in
wholesale
, reflecting:
–
changes in certain macroeconomic variables, an update to loss assumptions on certain loans in Markets, and a reduction due to charge-offs largely from collateral-dependent loans,
predominantly offset by
–
net downgrade activity,
