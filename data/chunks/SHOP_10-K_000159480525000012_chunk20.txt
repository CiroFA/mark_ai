Sustainability
Shopify is a company that wants to see the next century and has taken many steps to build a sustainable business, including removing and reducing emissions from building and home office energy usage and business travel and leveraging Google Cloud for platform operations. In 2019, Shopify launched the Sustainability Fund which is designed to identify and support impactful carbon-removal and reduction technologies and projects. Shopify is also a founding member of Frontier, alongside Stripe, Alphabet and McKinsey, among others, with a goal to collectively purchase over $1 billion of permanent carbon removal by the end of 2030. Merchants can also choose to address carbon associated with shipping their orders by adding the Shopify Planet app to their store.
