European currencies. At March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, Abbott held the gross notional amounts of $
16.2
billion
of such foreign currency forward exchange contracts.
Abbott has designated a yen-denominated,
5
-year term loan of $
612
million and $
583
million as of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively, as a hedge of the net investment in certain foreign subsidiaries. The change in the value of the debt, which is due to changes in foreign exchange rates, is recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax.
Abbott is a party to interest rate hedge contracts with a notional amount totaling $
1.2
billion at March 31, 2025 and $
2.2
billion at December 31, 2024 to manage its exposure to changes in the fair value of fixed-rate debt. The decrease from December 31, 2024 was due to the maturity of $
1.0
billion of interest rate hedge contracts in conjunction with long-term debt, both of which matured in March 2025.
These contracts are designated as fair value hedges of the variability of the fair value of fixed-rate debt due to changes in the long-term benchmark interest rates. The effect of the hedge is to change a fixed-rate interest obligation to a variable rate for that portion of the debt. Abbott records the contracts at fair value and adjusts the carrying amount of the fixed-rate debt by an offsetting amount.
