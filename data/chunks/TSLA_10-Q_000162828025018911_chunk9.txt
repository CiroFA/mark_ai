Income Taxes
Our effective tax rate was
29
% for the three months ended March 31, 2025, compared to
26
% for the three months ended March 31, 2024. The change in our effective tax rate was primarily due to the changes in the mix of our jurisdictional earnings.
Our effective tax rates for the first three months of 2025 and 2024 as compared to the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% were primarily impacted by the mix of our jurisdictional earnings subject to different tax rates, valuation allowances on our deferred tax assets and benefits from our U.S. tax credits and the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (“IRA”) manufacturing credits.
