The Company values RSUs at their grant-date fair value as measured by BlackRock's common stock price.

The total fair market value of RSUs granted to employees during 2024, 2023 and 2022 was
$
1.1
billion

Performance-Based RSUs
Pursuant to the Award Plan, performance-based RSUs may be granted to certain employees. Each performance-based award consists of a “base” number of RSUs granted to the employee.
