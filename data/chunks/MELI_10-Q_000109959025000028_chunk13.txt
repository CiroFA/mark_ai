Notes to unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements
The Company’s assets and liabilities measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis were valued using i) Level 1 inputs: unadjusted quoted prices in active markets (Level 1 instrument valuations are obtained from observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets in active markets); ii) Level 2 inputs: obtained from readily-available pricing sources for comparable instruments as well as instruments with inactive markets at the measurement date; and iii) Level 3 inputs: valuations based on unobservable inputs reflecting Company’s assumptions. The unobservable inputs of the fair value of contingent considerations classified as Level 3 refer to the amounts to be paid according to the agreement of an acquisition, the likelihood of achievement of the targets included in that arrangement (expected to be 100%), and the Company’s historical experience with similar arrangements. Reasonable variation on those unobservable inputs would not significantly change the fair value of those instruments. As of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, the Company had not changed the methodology nor the assumptions used to estimate the fair value of the financial instruments.
There were no transfers to and from Levels 1, 2 and 3 during the three-month period ended March 31, 2025, nor during the year ended December 31, 2024.
The Company’s election of the fair value option applies to: i) foreign government debt securities, ii) U.S. government debt securities and iii) Meli Dólar liability. The Company recognized fair value changes of foreign and U.S. government debt securities, which include the related interest income of those instruments, in net service revenues and financial income if it is related to Mercado Pago’s operations or in interest income and other financial gains if not. Such fair value changes and interest income amount to gains of $
125
million and $
69
million in net service revenues and financial income, and $
20
million and $
10
million in interest income and other financial gains for the three-month periods ended March 31, 2025 and 2024,
