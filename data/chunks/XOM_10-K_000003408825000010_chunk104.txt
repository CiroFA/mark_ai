which each subsidiary operates. Operations in the Product Solutions businesses use the local currency. However, the U.S. dollar is used in countries with a history of high inflation (primarily in Latin America) and in Singapore, which predominantly sells into the U.S. dollar export market. Upstream operations which are relatively self-contained and integrated within a particular country, such as in Canada and Europe, use the local currency. Some Upstream operations, primarily in Asia and Africa, use the U.S. dollar because they predominantly sell crude and natural gas production into U.S. dollar-denominated markets.
For all operations, gains or losses from remeasuring foreign currency transactions into the functional currency are included in income.
Note 2.
Russia
In response to Russia’s military action in Ukraine, the Corporation announced in early 2022 that it planned to discontinue operations on the Sakhalin-1 project (“Sakhalin”) and develop steps to exit the venture. In light of this, an impairment assessment was conducted, and management determined that the carrying value of the asset group was not recoverable. As a result, the Corporation’s first-quarter 2022 earnings included after-tax charges of $
3.4
billion largely representing the full impairment of its operations related to Sakhalin. On a before-tax basis, the charges amounted to $
4.6
billion, substantially all of which is reflected in the line captioned “Depreciation and depletion (including impairments)” on the Consolidated Statement of Income. Effective October 14, 2022, the Russian government unilaterally terminated the Corporation’s interests in Sakhalin, transferring operations to a Russian operator. The Corporation’s fourth-quarter 2022 results include an after-tax benefit of $
1.1
billion largely reflecting the impact of the expropriation on the Company’s various obligations related to Sakhalin. The Corporation's exit from the project resulted in approximately
150
million oil-equivalent barrels no longer qualifying as proved reserves at year-end 2022.
