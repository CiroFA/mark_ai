The increase in income tax expense in 2024 of $1.6 billion was primarily due to the tax impacts of the asset sales in Canada, partially offset by the decrease in total income before tax for the company of $2.1 billion. The decrease in income before taxes for the company was primarily the result of lower downstream margins, lower upstream realizations, higher operating expenses, in part due to severance charges, partially offset by the absence of charges from decommissioning obligations for previously divested assets, higher sales volumes and favorable foreign exchange impacts.
U.S. income before tax decreased from $8.6 billion in 2023 to $8.1 billion in 2024. This $0.5 billion decrease in income was primarily driven by lower downstream margins, higher operating expenses, in part due to severance charges, and lower upstream realizations, partially offset by the absence of charges related to decommissioning obligations for previously divested assets and higher sales volumes. The increase of $0.1 billion in U.S. income tax expense between year-over-year periods, from $1.8 billion in 2023 to $1.9 billion in 2024, was primarily driven by current period unfavorable tax items.
International income before tax decreased from $21.0 billion in 2023 to $19.5 billion in 2024.
