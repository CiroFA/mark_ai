Other Derivatives
We also use foreign currency forward contracts, which have not been designated as hedges, to hedge balance sheet exposures, such as intercompany loans. These instruments are generally short-term in nature, with typical maturities of less than one year, and are subject to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. Realized gains or losses and changes in the estimated fair value of these derivatives were net losses of $
48,840
, $
135,586
and $
168,625
for fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Gains and losses on these contracts are recorded in Other income (expense), net in the Consolidated Income Statements and are offset by gains and losses on the related hedged items.

In the Consolidated Balance Sheets, we record derivative assets and liabilities at gross fair value.
The potential effect of netting derivative assets against liabilities under the counterparty master agreements is as follows:
