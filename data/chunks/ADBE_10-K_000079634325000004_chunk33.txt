Entry into markets with weaker protection of brands or changes in the legal systems in countries in which we operate may also impact our ability to protect our brands. If we fail to maintain, enhance or protect our brands, or if we incur excessive expenses in our efforts to do so, our users’ trust in us and purchasing decisions and our business and financial results may be adversely affected.

We may not realize the anticipated benefits of investments or acquisitions, and they may disrupt our business and divert management’s attention.

inability to achieve the financial and strategic goals of the investment or acquisition;

•
disruption of our ongoing business and distraction of our management and other personnel;
•
challenges to completing or failure to complete an announced investment or acquisition related to the failure to obtain regulatory approval, or the need to satisfy certain conditions precedent to closing such transaction (such as divestitures, ownership or operational restrictions or other structural or behavioral remedies) that could limit the anticipated benefits of the transaction;
•
entry into markets in which we have minimal prior experience and where competitors in such markets have stronger market positions;
•
inability to retain personnel, key customers, distributors, vendors and other business partners of the acquired business;
•
delay in customer and distributor purchasing decisions due to uncertainty about the direction of our product and service offerings;

incurring higher than anticipated costs to effectively integrate an acquired business, to bring an acquired company into compliance with applicable laws and regulations, additional compensation issued or assumed in connection with an acquisition, to divest products, services or solutions acquired in unsuccessful investments or acquisitions, to amortize costs for acquired intangible assets or because of our inability to take advantage of anticipated tax benefits;
