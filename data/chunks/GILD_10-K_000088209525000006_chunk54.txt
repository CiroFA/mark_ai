The following table summarizes our key financial results for the year and period-over-period changes:
Total revenues increased 6% to $28.8 billion in 2024, compared to 2023, primarily due to higher sales in HIV, Oncology and Liver Disease, partially offset by lower sales of Veklury.
Net income attributable to Gilead was $480 million and diluted earnings per share attributable to Gilead was $0.38 in 2024, compared to net income attributable to Gilead of $5.7 billion and $4.50 diluted earnings per share attributable to Gilead in 2023. The decrease was primarily due to:
•
A pre-tax IPR&D partial impairment charge of $4.2 billion related to Trodelvy IPR&D assets; and
•
Higher acquired IPR&D expenses, primarily $3.8 billion related to the acquisition of CymaBay; partially offset by
•
Higher product sales; and
•
Lower income tax expense.

Outlook
As we look to 2025, we expect to see continued increases in demand for our products overall, bolstered by the growth of our HIV business. We look forward to the regulatory decisions for twice-yearly lenacapavir for HIV prevention in the U.S. under priority review as well as in the EU where we submitted a marketing authorization application in early 2025. We anticipate that strong, demand-led volume growth in 2025 will be offset by: (i) the effects of the Inflation Reduction Act, which is expected to increase our payment obligations under the redesigned Medicare Part D discount program; (ii) an expected decrease in our Veklury product sales reflecting lower rates of COVID-19-related hospitalizations; and (iii) the impact of the U.S. dollar strengthening against major foreign currencies.
Our R&D portfolio includes over 100 pre-clinical and clinical-stage programs across our core therapeutic areas. We plan to continue investing in our business and R&D pipeline both internally and externally through partnerships and select business development transactions.
