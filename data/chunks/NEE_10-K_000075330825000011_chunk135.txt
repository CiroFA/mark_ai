The above estimates are subject to continuing review and adjustment and actual capital expenditures may vary significantly from these estimates.
In addition to guarantees noted in Note 8 with regards to XPLR, NEECH has guaranteed or provided indemnifications or letters of credit related to third parties, including certain obligations of investments in joint ventures accounted for under the equity method, totaling approximately $
705
million at December 31, 2024. These obligations primarily related to guaranteeing the residual value of certain financing leases and obligations under purchased power agreements. Payment guarantees and related contracts with respect to unconsolidated entities for which NEE or one of its subsidiaries are the guarantor are recorded at fair value and are included in noncurrent other liabilities on NEE’s consolidated balance sheets. Management believes that the exposure associated with these guarantees is not material.
