anticipated performance of the firm’s segments and product lines, (c) the overall success of the firm and (d) where applicable, the estimated participation interests given to the named executive officer at the beginning of the year in respect of the investments to be made in that year. We make annual bonus payments in the first quarter of the ensuing year to reward individual performance for the prior year. The ultimate bonus payments that are made are fully discretionary as further discussed below under “— Determination of Incentive Compensation.”
For 2024, all named executive officers other than Mr. Schwarzman were selected to participate in the Bonus Deferral Plan. The Bonus Deferral Plan provides for the deferral of a portion of each participant’s annual cash bonus payment. Except as otherwise determined by the Plan Administrator (as defined in the Bonus Deferral Plan), the amount of each participant’s annual cash bonus payment deferred under the Bonus Deferral Plan is calculated pursuant to a deferral rate table using the participant’s total annual incentive compensation, which generally includes such participant’s annual cash bonus payment and a portion of any incentive fees earned in connection with our investment funds and is subject to certain adjustments, including reductions for mandatory contributions to our investment funds. By deferring a portion of a participant’s compensation, the Bonus Deferral Plan acts as an employment retention mechanism and thereby enhances the alignment of interests between such participant and the firm. Many publicly traded asset managers utilize deferred compensation plans as a means of retaining and motivating their professionals, and we believe that it is in the interest of our stockholders to do the same for our personnel.
On January 10, 2025, Mr. Gray, Mr. Chae, Mr. Finley and Mr. Sawhney each received a deferral award under the Bonus Deferral Plan of deferred restricted common stock units in respect of their service in 2024. The percentage of the 2024 annual cash bonus payment mandatorily deferred into deferred restricted common stock units for Messrs. Gray, Chae, Finley and Sawhney was approximately 100%, 100%, 40% and 100%, respectively. These awards are reflected as stock awards for fiscal year 2024 in the Summary Compensation Table and in the Grants of Plan-Based Awards in 2024 table.
