U.S. Tax Reform
In December 2017, the Tax Act was enacted into law in the U.S. The Tax Act made significant changes to U.S. federal tax law, including a one-time deemed repatriation tax on accumulated unremitted international earnings, to be paid over eight years. In 2024, the Company reduced its income tax expense that was recorded during the year ended December 31, 2018 by $
416
million relating to its federal one-time deemed repatriation liability. The reduction in expense resulted from a recent U.S. Tax Court decision in Varian Medical Systems, Inc. vs. Commissioner. Under the Tax Act, the Company's future cash generated by the Company's international operations can generally be repatriated without further U.S. federal income tax, but will be subject to U.S. state income taxes and international withholding taxes, which have been accrued by the Company. The Tax Act also introduced in 2018 a tax on 50% of GILTI, which is income determined to be in excess of a specified routine rate of return, and a base erosion and anti-abuse tax ("BEAT") aimed at preventing the erosion of the U.S. tax base. The Company has adopted an accounting policy to treat taxes on GILTI as period costs.
Several countries outside the U.S. have adopted rules, effective January 1, 2024, that impose a
15
% minimum global tax. This is in response to the framework set forth by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development with respect to its base erosion and profit shifting project. The impact of these rules have been reflected in our 2024 income tax expense.
