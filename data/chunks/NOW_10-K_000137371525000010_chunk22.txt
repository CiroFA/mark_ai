and subject to disruptive technologies with low barriers to entry, to shifting customer needs and to frequent introductions of new products and services. As our business expands and the industries in which we operate evolve, we increasingly find ourselves in competition with solutions and alternative approaches to solving customer needs, including, among others:
•
enterprise application software vendors (including cloud-based and traditional on-premises vendors) such as Oracle, SAP, Salesforce and Workday;
•
new technologies and entrants (including both point-solutions and platform solutions covering a wide range of functionalities);
•
custom development and in-house solutions;
•
technology consultants;
•
systems integrators; and
•
software resellers.

Intellectual Property
We rely upon a combination of U.S. and international copyright, trade secret, patent and trademark laws and confidentiality procedures and contractual rights and restrictions to establish, protect and grow our intellectual property (“IP”) rights. We enter into confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements with our employees, partners, vendors, consultants and other third parties and limit access to our IP and other proprietary information. We also purchase or license IP and technology that we incorporate into our products or services.
We continue to grow our global patent portfolio and IP rights that relate to our business. Our success depends in part upon our ability to protect our core technology and IP. As of December 31, 2024, we had over 2,000 U.S. and foreign patents, including patents acquired from third parties, and over 600 pending patent applications. We do not believe that our proprietary technology is dependent on any single patent or group of related patents. See “Risk Factors—We may not be able to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights.”
