whether their own or from a growing collection of pre-optimized, ready-to-use AI models.
Additional Significant Technologies used in Mobile and Other Industries.
We continue to play a leading role in developing (and/or have acquired) many other technologies used across mobile and other industries, including:
•
wireless local area networks (WLAN), such as Wi-Fi, which link two or more nearby devices wirelessly and usually provide connectivity through an access point;
•
Bluetooth technology, which is a wireless personal area network that provides wireless connectivity between devices over short distances ranging from a few centimeters to approximately one hundred meters using the 2.4GHz industrial, scientific and medical spectrum band;
•
position location technologies such as the Assisted-Global Positioning System (A-GPS), Assisted Global Navigation Satellite System (A-GNSS) and WLAN positioning technologies used in most cellular handsets today;
•
multimedia technologies including video, audio and speech compression technologies and system-level solutions enabling feature-rich, high-quality experiences in imaging, audio and vision intelligence;
•
operating system and user interface features;
•
XR platform features such as 6DoF (six-degrees of freedom) head tracking and controller capabilities, video pass-through and embedded cellular connectivity for new types of user experiences, and hybrid computing to distribute workloads across devices;
•
automotive platform features such as digital cockpit and ADAS/AD, to enable in-cabin experiences and assisted driving solutions;
•
security and content protection systems for enhanced device security without compromising the user experience;
•
volatile (LPDDR4, 5) and non-volatile (eMMC) memory and related controllers;
•
fast charging features, enabling devices to charge quickly, safely and efficiently;
•
Qualcomm® Smart Transmit™ technology, a modem-to-antenna technology that optimizes data speeds while complying with RF transmit power limits; and
•
power management systems for improved battery life and device charging.
Acquisitions
We make strategic investments and acquisitions in order to open new opportunities for our technologies, support the design and introduction of new products and services (or enhance existing products or services), obtain resources with development and/or market expertise, grow our patent portfolio or pursue new businesses as part of our strategic plan.
Operating Segments
We have three reportable segments. We conduct business primarily through QCT and QTL, while QSI makes strategic investments. Additional information regarding our operating segments is provided in this Annual Report in “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 8. Segment Information.”
QCT Segment.
QCT is a leading developer and supplier of integrated circuits products and system software with advanced connectivity and high-performance, low-power computing technologies, for use in mobile devices; automotive
