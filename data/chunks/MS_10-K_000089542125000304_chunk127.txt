losses representing a credit loss is recognized in Other revenues and as an increase to the ACL for AFS securities, with the remainder of unrealized losses recognized in OCI. A credit loss exists if the Firm does not expect to recover the amortized cost basis of the security.
When considering whether a credit loss exists, the Firm considers relevant information, including:
•
guarantees (implicit or explicit) by the U.S. government;
•
the extent to which the fair value has been less than the amortized cost basis;
•
adverse conditions specifically related to the security, its industry or geographic area;
•
changes in the financial condition of the issuer of the security or, in the case of an asset-backed debt security, changes in the financial condition of the underlying loan obligors;
•
the payment structure of the debt security and the likelihood of the issuer being able to make payments that increase in the future;
•
failure of the issuer of the security to make scheduled interest or principal payments;
•
the current rating and any changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency.
If a credit loss exists, the Firm measures the credit loss as the difference between the present value of cash flows expected to be collected (discounted at the implicit interest rate at acquisition of the security or discounted at the effective yield for securities that incorporate changes in prepayment assumptions) and the amortized cost basis of the security. Changes in prepayment assumptions alone are not considered to result in a credit loss. When estimating the present value of expected cash flows, information utilized includes the remaining payment terms of the security, prepayment speeds, financial condition of the issuer, expected defaults and the value of any underlying collateral.
