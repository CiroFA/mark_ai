state as “boycotting” or “discriminating” against particular industries or considering environmental and social factors in their investment processes and proxy voting. Other states and localities may adopt similar legislation or other environmental and social-related laws and positions that adversely impact BlackRock’s business. BlackRock has previously communicated and may communicate certain initiatives and goals for its corporate activities related to the environment, human capital management, and other environmental and social-related matters. BlackRock faces criticism for the scope or nature of certain initiatives or goals and may face additional criticism for revisions thereto. If BlackRock is not able to successfully manage environmental and social-related expectations across varied stakeholder interests, it may adversely affect BlackRock’s reputation, ability to attract and retain clients, employees, shareholders and business partners or result in litigation, legal or governmental action, which may cause its AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
Damage to BlackRock’s reputation may harm its business.
BlackRock’s reputation is critical to its relationships with its clients, employees, shareholders and business partners. BlackRock’s reputation may be harmed by, among other factors, regulatory, enforcement or other governmental actions, technology or operational failures, poor investment performance, ineffective management or monitoring of key third-party relationships, ransomware or other cybersecurity incidents, privacy incidents, employee errors or misconduct, failures to manage risks or conflicts of interest, or legal actions related to BlackRock or its products and services. In addition, BlackRock’s business, scale and investments subject it to significant media coverage and increasing attention from a broad range of stakeholders. This heightened scrutiny has resulted in negative publicity and adverse actions for BlackRock and may continue to do so in the future. Any perceived or actual action or lack thereof, or perceived lack of transparency, by BlackRock on matters subject to scrutiny, such as environmental and social matters, may be viewed differently by various stakeholders and adversely impact BlackRock’s reputation and business, including through redemptions or terminations by clients, and legal and governmental action and scrutiny. BlackRock’s global presence and investments on behalf of its clients around the world could also lead to heightened scrutiny and criticism in an increasingly fragmented geopolitical landscape. For example, BlackRock has received criticism from some stakeholders because of its operations and investments in certain countries on behalf of clients, including China. These criticisms could adversely impact BlackRock’s reputation and business. In addition, the increasing popularity of social media and non-mainstream Internet news sources may lead to faster and wider dissemination of adverse publicity,
