As a result of the factors discussed above, we reported $20.2 billion and $16.3 billion of consolidated net income for fiscal 2025 and 2024, respectively, which represents an increase of $3.9 billion and $5.0 billion for fiscal 2025 and 2024, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. Diluted net income per common share attributable to Walmart ("EPS") was $2.41, $1.91 and $1.42 for fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
Walmart U.S. Segment
Net sales for the Walmart U.S. segment increased $20.6 billion or 4.7% and $21.3 billion or 5.1% for fiscal 2025 and 2024, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. The increases in net sales were primarily due to increases in comparable sales of 4.8% and 5.5% for fiscal 2025 and 2024, respectively. Comparable sales in fiscal 2025 were driven by growth in transactions and unit volumes, with strong sales in grocery and health and wellness. Comparable sales in fiscal 2024 were driven by growth in transactions combined with growth in average ticket, including strong sales in grocery and health and wellness. Walmart U.S. eCommerce sales positively contributed approximately 2.9% and 2.6% to comparable sales for fiscal 2025 and 2024, respectively, which was primarily driven by store-fulfilled pickup and delivery.
Membership and other income increased $0.6 billion and $0.1 billion for fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2024, primarily driven by growth in membership fee income from Walmart+ and recycling income.
Gross profit rate increased 47 and 20 basis points for fiscal 2025 and 2024, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. The increase in fiscal 2025 gross profit rate was primarily driven by managing prices aligned to our competitive historic price gaps and growth in higher margin businesses, partially offset by mix shifts into lower margin merchandise categories. The increase in fiscal 2024 gross profit rate was primarily due to managing prices aligned to our competitive historic price gaps and lapping higher net markdowns incurred in the prior year, partially offset by product mix shifts into lower margin categories.
Operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales increased 44 and 9 basis points for fiscal 2025 and 2024, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. The increase for fiscal 2025 was primarily due to increased marketing
