Revenue Recognition
The Company’s revenue recognition policies are as follows:
•
Subscription fees are recognized ratably over the term of the subscription.
•
Affiliate fees are recognized as the programming is provided based on contractually specified per subscriber rates and the actual number of the affiliate’s customers receiving the programming. For affiliate contracts with fixed license fees, the fees are recognized ratably over the contract term. If an affiliate contract includes a minimum guaranteed license fee, the guaranteed license fee is recognized ratably over the guaranteed period and any fees earned in excess of the guarantee are recognized as earned once the minimum guarantee has been exceeded. Affiliate agreements may also include a license to use the network programming for on demand viewing. As the fees charged under these contracts are generally based on a contractually specified per subscriber rate for the number of underlying subscribers of the affiliate, revenues are recognized as earned.
•
Advertising sales are recognized as revenue, net of agency commissions, when commercials are aired. For contracts that contain a guaranteed number of impressions, revenues are recognized based on impressions delivered. When the guaranteed number of impressions is not met (“ratings shortfall”), revenues are not recognized for the ratings shortfall until the additional impressions are delivered.
•
Theme park admissions are recognized when the tickets are used. Sales of annual passes are recognized ratably over the period for which the pass is available for use.
•
Resorts and vacations sales are recognized as revenue as the services are provided to the guest. Sales of vacation club properties are recognized as revenue upon the later of when title transfers to the customer or when construction activity is deemed complete.

Merchandise, food and beverage sales are recognized at the time of sale. Sales from our branded internet shopping sites and to wholesalers are recognized upon delivery.

•
Merchandise licensing fees are recognized as revenue as earned based on the contractual royalty rate applied to the licensee’s underlying product sales.
