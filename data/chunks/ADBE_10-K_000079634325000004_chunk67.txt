$1.5 billion senior unsecured revolving credit agreement (the “Revolving Credit Agreement”) with a syndicate of lenders, providing for loans to us and certain of our subsidiaries through June 30, 2027. Subject to the agreement of lenders, we may obtain up to an additional $500 million in commitments, for a maximum aggregate commitment of $2 billion. As of November 29, 2024, there were no outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Agreement and the entire $1.5 billion credit line remains available for borrowing. Under the terms of our Revolving Credit Agreement, we are not prohibited from paying cash dividends unless payment would trigger an event of default or if one currently exists. We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.
Commercial Paper Program
We have a commercial paper program under which we may issue unsecured commercial paper up to a total of $3 billion outstanding at any time, with maturities of up to 397 days from the date of issue. The net proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper are expected to be used for general corporate purposes, which may include working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, stock repurchases, refinancing indebtedness or any other general corporate purposes. As of November 29, 2024, there were no outstanding borrowings under the commercial paper program.
Senior Notes
In April 2024, we issued $500 million of senior notes due April 4, 2027, $750 million of senior notes due April 4, 2029 and $750 million of senior notes due April 4, 2034. In total, we have $5.65 billion of senior notes outstanding, which rank equally with our other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. As of November 29, 2024, the carrying value of our senior notes was $5.63 billion and our maximum commitment for interest payments was $806 million for the remaining duration of our outstanding senior notes. Interest is payable semi-annually, in arrears. Our senior notes do not contain any financial covenants.

During the first quarter of fiscal 2024, we reclassified the senior notes due February 1, 2025 as current debt in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of November 29, 2024, the carrying value of our current debt was $1.50 billion, net of the related discount and issuance costs. Though we intend to refinance the current portion of our debt on or before the due date, the timing of the refinancing may be impacted by market conditions.
Contractual Obligations
Our principal commitments consist of purchase obligations resulting from agreements to purchase goods and services in the ordinary course of business. As of November 29, 2024, the value of our non-cancellable unconditional purchase obligations was $5.79 billion, primarily relating to contracts with vendors for third-party hosting and data center services.
