our Lower 48 unconventional plays. The remainder of transfers were from development across the other geographic regions.
At both December 31, 2024 and 2023, our PUDs represented 35 percent of total proved reserves. Costs incurred for the year ended December 31, 2024, relating to the development of PUDs were $9.4 billion. A portion of our costs incurred each year relates to development projects where the PUDs will be converted to proved developed reserves in future years.
At the end of 2024, approximately 88 percent of total PUDs were under development or scheduled for development within five years of initial disclosure, including all of our Lower 48 PUDs. The PUDs to be developed beyond five years are in the Willow project in Alaska, a development that is currently underway with production anticipated in 2029 due to its large scale and remote location, as well as in major development areas which are currently producing and located in Canada and in our equity affiliate in Australia.
Results of Operations
The company’s results of operations from oil and gas activities for the years 2024, 2023 and 2022 are shown in the following tables. Non-oil and gas activities, such as pipeline and marine operations, LNG operations, crude oil and gas marketing activities, and the profit element of transportation operations in which we have an ownership interest are excluded.

Statistics
*At year-end 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Delaware Basin Area in Lower 48 contained more than 15 percent of our total proved reserves.
*Average sales prices for Alaska crude oil above reflects a reduction for transportation costs in which we have an ownership interest that are incurred subsequent to the terminal point of the production function. Accordingly, the
