During the second quarter of 2024, we were notified that an affiliate of QatarEnergy transferred a
5
percent joint venture interest in NFE4 to an affiliate of China National Petroleum Corporation. As a result, we have concluded NFE4 is a VIE as it currently requires advances from the joint venture participants to fund the project. We are not the primary beneficiary of the VIE because we do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact economic performance of NFE4, which involve activities related to the production and commercialization of natural gas, as well as LNG processing and export marketing. As a result, we do not consolidate NFE4, and it is accounted for under the equity method. As of December 31, 2024, the carrying value of our equity is included in the total carrying value of our equity method investments in Qatar. This equity together with the guarantee is the only financial support that we have provided NFE4.
