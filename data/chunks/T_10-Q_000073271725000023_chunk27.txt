The following tables highlight other key measures of performance for Consumer Wireline:
Broadband
revenues increased in the first quarter of 2025, driven by a 19.0% increase in fiber revenues. Higher fiber revenues reflect an increase in fiber customers, which we expect to continue as we invest further in building our fiber footprint, and higher ARPU. This increase was partially offset by declines in copper-based broadband services.
Legacy voice and data services
revenues decreased in the first quarter of 2025, reflecting the continued decline in demand for these services in favor of other technologies, such as wireless and fiber services.
Other service and equipment
revenues decreased in the first quarter of 2025, reflecting the continued decline in the number of VoIP customers.
Operations and support
expenses decreased in the first quarter of 2025. The expense decrease in the first quarter was primarily driven by lower customer support costs and network-related costs that included higher vendor settlements in 2025.
Depreciation
expense increased in the first quarter of 2025, primarily due to ongoing capital spending for strategic initiatives such as fiber and network upgrades and expansion, which we expect to continue through the remainder of 2025.
