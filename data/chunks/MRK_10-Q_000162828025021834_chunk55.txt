Japan is expected to decline significantly in future periods given that the last date to initiate the first dose in the national immunization program catch-up cohort was March 2025. Beginning in mid-2024, the Company observed a significant decline in shipments from its distributor and commercialization partner in China, Chongqing Zhifei Biological Products Co., Ltd. (Zhifei), to disease and control prevention institutions and correspondingly into the points of vaccination compared with prior quarters of 2024, resulting in above normal inventory levels at Zhifei. Accordingly, the Company shipped less than its contracted doses to Zhifei in the latter part of 2024. Lower demand in China persisted and, at the end of 2024, overall channel inventory levels in China remained elevated at above normal levels. Therefore, the Company made a decision to temporarily pause shipments to China beginning in February 2025 through at least the middle of the year and, as a result, combined sales of

Gardasil

Gardasil
9 for use in males 16-26 years of age to help prevent certain HPV-related cancers and diseases.
Gardasil
9 is currently indicated in the U.S. for a two-dose regimen in adolescents aged 9-14 and a three-dose regimen for those aged 15-45. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) has stated that at its meeting in June 2025 it intends to discuss and, potentially, vote on a change to the dose recommendation, which could include a reduction in the number of recommended doses.
The Company is a party to license agreements pursuant to which the Company pays royalties on sales of

Global sales of
ProQuad
(Measles, Mumps, Rubella and Varicella Virus Vaccine Live), a pediatric combination vaccine to help protect against measles, mumps, rubella and varicella, declined 41% in the first quarter of 2025. As a result of manufacturing delays, in January 2025, the Company borrowed doses of
ProQuad
from the CDC Pediatric Vaccine Stockpile. The borrowing reduced sales of
ProQuad
in the first quarter of 2025 by approximately $70 million. These doses are being used to support routine vaccination in the U.S. Worldwide sales of
M-M-R
II (Measles, Mumps and Rubella Virus Vaccine Live), a vaccine to help protect against measles, mumps and rubella, grew 62% in the first quarter of 2025 primarily due to higher sales in the U.S. largely reflecting private sector buy-in due to measles outbreaks, as well as higher pricing.
