Critical Accounting Estimates
See Note 1. Summary of Business and Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information about our significant accounting policies and how estimates are involved in the preparation of our financial statements. We believe the following reflect the critical accounting estimates used in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements.
Rebates and Chargebacks
Rebates and chargebacks are determined using a complex estimation process which requires significant judgment by management in part due to the lag between the date of the product sales and the date the related rebates or chargeback claims are settled. Rebates and chargebacks are based on contractual arrangements or statutory requirements and include amounts due to payers and healthcare providers under various programs. These amounts may vary by product, payer and individual plans. Rebates and chargebacks are estimated primarily based on product sales, and expected payer mix and discount rates, which require significant estimates and judgment. In developing our estimates of rebates and chargebacks, we consider the following:
•
product sales, including product mix and pricing;
•
historical and estimated payer mix;
•
statutory discount requirements and contractual terms;
•
historical claims experience and processing time lags;
•
estimated patient population;
•
known market events or trends;
•
market research;
•
channel inventory data obtained from our major U.S. wholesalers; and
•
other pertinent internal or external information.
The following table summarizes the consolidated activities and ending balances in our rebates and chargebacks accounts, including adjustments made relating to previous years’ sales as a result of changes in estimates:
We assess and update our estimates each reporting period to reflect actual claims and other current information. Historically, our actual rebates and chargebacks claimed for prior years have varied by less than 5% from our estimates. However, historical results are not indicative of future results.
