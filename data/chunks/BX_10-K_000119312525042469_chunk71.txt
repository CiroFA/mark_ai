our key personnel would be required to pay. The levying of additional taxes on carried interest, or possible increase in state law tax rates, along with changing opinions regarding living in some geographies where we have offices, may adversely affect our ability to recruit, retain and motivate our current and future professionals.

There is no guarantee that the
non-competition
and
non-solicitation
agreements to which our senior managing directors and other key personnel are subject, together with our other arrangements with them, will prevent them from leaving, joining our competitors or otherwise competing with us. Such agreements also expire after a certain period of time, at which point such personnel would be free to compete against us and solicit our clients and employees. In addition, such agreements may not be enforceable in all cases, particularly as U.S. states and/or federal agencies enact legislation or adopt rules aimed at effectively prohibiting

non-competition
agreement to which our senior managing directors or other key personal are subject if challenged. Further, legislation that would prohibit
post-employment
non-competition
agreements except in limited circumstances has been introduced in New York.

Changes in U.S. and foreign taxation of businesses and other tax laws, regulations or treaties or an adverse interpretation of these items by tax authorities could adversely affect us, including by adversely impacting our effective tax rate and tax liability.
Our effective tax rate and tax liability is based on the application of current income tax laws, regulations and treaties. These laws, regulations and treaties are complex, and the manner which they apply to us and our funds is sometimes open to interpretation. Significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets. Although management believes its application of
