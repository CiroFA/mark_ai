the first quarter of 2025 declined 9.8% versus 2024.
The comparative increase in BHA revenues in the first quarter of 2025 reflected higher new and pre-owned vehicle sales (6.0%), primarily due to increased units sold. BHA’s finance and insurance revenues increased 6.7% in the first quarter of 2025 compared to 2024. The comparative declines in revenues of the home furnishings and the other retailing businesses were primarily attributable to a combination of increased competition, sluggish demand and impacts of higher economic uncertainty.
Retailing group pre-tax earnings declined $24 million (7.6%) in the first quarter of 2025 compared to 2024. BHA’s pre-tax earnings in the first quarter of 2025 were essentially unchanged from 2024, attributable to lower gross margins on auto sales offset by earnings increases from the parts/service/repair and finance/service contract operations. Aggregate pre-tax earnings in the first quarter of 2025 for the remainder of our retailing group declined $24 million (32.8%) compared to 2024, reflecting lower earnings from our other retailing businesses, partially offset by increased earnings from the home furnishings businesses.
Pilot Travel Centers
Pilot operates travel centers, primarily under the names Pilot or Flying J, and fuel-only retail locations. Pilot also operates large wholesale fuel and fuel marketing platforms in the U.S. We acquired the remaining 20% noncontrolling interest in Pilot on January 16, 2024.
Pilot’s revenues in the first quarter of 2025 declined $2.1 billion (16.6%) compared to the same period in 2024. The decline was primarily attributable to lower average fuel prices per gallon, partially offset by higher fuel volumes.
Pilot’s pre-tax earnings increased $98 million (140.0%) in the first quarter of 2025 compared to 2024. The increase reflected gains from asset dispositions and lower interest expense, partially offset by higher selling, general and administrative expenses. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses reflected higher compensation and benefits and maintenance costs, as well as several other expense categories. The decline in interest expense was attributable to reduced borrowing levels and lower rates. Pilot’s borrowings are currently from certain Berkshire insurance subsidiaries and approximated $4.2 billion at March 31, 2025, a decline of approximately $1.5 billion since March 31, 2024. The interest on Pilot’s borrowings from affiliates is included in insurance investment income on page 34.
