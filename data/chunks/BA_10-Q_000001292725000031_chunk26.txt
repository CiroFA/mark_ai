months ended March 31, 2025, totaled $6,017 million and primarily relate to 777X aircraft. ASC 606 adjustments include consideration of aircraft orders where a customer-controlled contingency may exist, as well as an assessment of whether the customer is committed to perform, impacts of geopolitical events or related sanctions, or whether it is probable that the customer will pay the full amount of consideration when it is due. We may experience reductions to backlog and/or significant order cancellations due to various factors including delivery delays, production disruptions and delays to entry into service of the 777X, 737-7 and/or 737-10.
Accounting Quantity
The following table provides details of the accounting quantities and firm orders by program. Cumulative firm orders represent the cumulative number of commercial jet aircraft deliveries plus undelivered firm orders. Firm orders include certain military derivative aircraft that are not included in program accounting quantities. All revenues and costs associated with military derivative aircraft production are reported in the BDS segment.
† Customer financing aircraft orders are identified in parentheses.

Approximate undelivered orders by minor model for March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024: 737-7 (7%), 737-8 (63%), 737-9 (5%) and 737-10 (25%).
Program Highlights
737 Program
In January 2024, a 737-9 flight made an emergency landing after a mid-exit door plug detached in flight. As a result of the accident, the FAA investigated the 737 quality control system, including Spirit AeroSystems Holdings, Inc. (Spirit), and increased its oversight of Boeing’s production and quality and safety management systems. The FAA also communicated it will not approve production rate increases beyond 38 per month or additional production lines until Boeing has complied with required quality and safety standards. In 2024, we submitted a comprehensive safety and quality plan to the FAA to address the issues identified in connection with the FAA's investigation. We also took additional actions to improve safety and quality, which include investing in workforce training, simplifying plans and processes, eliminating defects, and enhancing our safety and quality culture. In 2025, we are continuing to implement these improvements and align our production plans consistent with the comprehensive safety and quality plan.
We are gradually increasing to a production rate of 38 per month aligned with our safety and quality plan. As of March 31, 2025, we had approximately 35 737-8 aircraft in inventory that were produced prior to 2023, including approximately 25 aircraft for customers in China. We are
