and 2022, respectively.
Advertising and market development expense remained consistent in 2024 compared to 2023, as higher client promotional spending was offset by lower spending on digital advertising. The decrease in 2023 from 2022 was primarily a result of lower advertising costs and lower client promotional spending for Ameritrade.
Communications expense decreased in 2024 compared to 2023, due to lower exchange quotation services expenses. The increase in 2023 compared to 2022 was primarily as a result of client communications related to Ameritrade account transitions completed during 2023.
Depreciation and amortization expense increased in 2024 from 2023, and in 2023 from 2022, primarily as a result of higher amortization of purchased and internally developed software and higher depreciation of hardware, driven by capital expenditures to support growth of the business and, in 2023, to support the Ameritrade integration.
Amortization of acquired intangible assets decreased in 2024 from 2023, and in 2023 from 2022, primarily as certain assets from the Ameritrade acquisition were fully amortized during 2023 and 2022.
Regulatory fees and assessments decreased in 2024 from 2023, primarily due to a $172 million FDIC special assessment recorded during the fourth quarter of 2023, partially offset by $30 million of incremental FDIC special assessments in 2024. The increase in 2023 from 2022 was primarily as a result of the FDIC special assessment described above and higher FDIC deposit insurance assessments during 2023, reflecting greater use of brokered CDs and a 2-basis point increase to the FDIC deposit insurance assessment rate, which became effective for the first quarterly assessment period in 2023. These increases were partially offset by a lower assessment base. See Current Regulatory and Other Developments for discussion of the FDIC special assessments.
Other expense increased in 2024 from 2023, primarily due to higher industry fees, partially offset by impairment charges recorded in 2023 related to restructuring. Industry fees increased primarily due to higher average SEC fee rates in effect during 2024 compared to 2023. Effective May 22, 2024, the SEC increased its fee rate applicable to most securities transactions from the rate in effect since late February 2023. The increase in other expense in 2023 from 2022 was primarily due to impairment charges in 2023 related to closing certain leased corporate offices for restructuring and Ameritrade integration. Other expense included restructuring costs of $37 million and $181 million in 2024 and 2023, respectively, and acquisition and integration-related costs of $27 million in 2023.
Capital expenditures primarily include capitalized software costs, information technology and telecommunications equipment, and buildings. Total capital expenditures were $607 million, $804 million, and $952 million in 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. Capital expenditures decreased 25% in 2024 compared to 2023,
