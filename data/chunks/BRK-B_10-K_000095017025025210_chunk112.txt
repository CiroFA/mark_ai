intermodal shipments from west coast imports and volumes from a new intermodal customer.
Operating revenues from industrial products declined 1.2% in 2024 to $5.6 billion from 2023, reflecting slight declines in volume and average revenue per car/unit. The volume decline was primarily due to lower aggregates, taconite, minerals and waste shipments, substantially offset by higher plastics and petroleum products volumes.

Operating revenues from agricultural products increased 4.5% to $5.8 billion in 2024 compared to 2023, attributable to a volume increase of 7.4%, partially offset by lower average revenue per car/unit. The volume increase was primarily due to higher grain, renewable fuels and fertilizer shipments.
Operating revenues from coal decreased 22.5% to $2.9 billion in 2024 compared to 2023. The decrease was attributable to a volume decrease of 17.9% and lower average revenue per car/unit. The volume decline was primarily due to lower natural gas prices.
Railroad operating expenses were $15.9 billion in 2024, a decrease of $173 million (1.1%) compared to 2023. The ratio of railroad operating expenses to railroad operating revenues declined 0.4 percentage points to 68.0% in 2024 versus 2023. Railroad compensation and benefits expenses increased $356 million (6.5%) in 2024 compared to 2023, primarily due to a $290 million charge related to a one-time payment included in the agreement with the SMART-TD labor union that was finalized in December 2024. This agreement allows BNSF the ability to redeploy brakepersons to conductors and engineers, which will allow BNSF to meet short-term hiring demands. Fuel expenses declined $417 million (11.3%) compared to 2023, primarily due to lower average fuel prices, partially offset by higher volumes. Railroad purchased services, equipment rents, materials and other expenses declined $126 million (3.0%), primarily due to cost reductions across numerous spend categories and lower property taxes, partially offset by a litigation charge in 2024 related to a judgment in an ongoing legal case with the Swinomish Tribe, which BNSF has appealed.
2023 versus 2022
Railroad operating revenues declined 6.9% in 2023 compared to 2022, reflecting lower overall volumes (5.7%) and average revenue per car/unit (0.6%), which was primarily attributable to lower fuel surcharge revenue, partially offset by favorable price and mix. Pre-tax earnings were $6.6 billion in 2023, a decline of 14.2% from 2022, reflecting lower volumes and higher non-fuel operating costs, partially offset by lower fuel costs.
Operating revenues from consumer products declined 14.7% in 2023 to $7.9 billion compared to 2022, reflecting a volume decrease of 8.4% and lower average revenue per car/unit. The volume decrease was primarily due to lower intermodal shipments resulting from reduced West Coast imports, the loss of an intermodal customer and competition from lower spot rates in
