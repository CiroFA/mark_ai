Office loans represented the largest property type concentration at 22 percent of the commercial real estate portfolio at March 31, 2025, and approximately one percent of total loans for the Corporation. This property type is roughly 75 percent Class A and had an origination loan-to-value of approximately 55 percent.
Reservable criticized exposure for the office property type was $5.2 billion at March 31, 2025, representing an increase of $168 million, or three percent, from December 31, 2024, with an aggregate loan-to-value of approximately 85 percent based on property appraisals completed in the last twelve months. Approximately $3.4 billion of office loans are scheduled to mature by the end of 2025.
During the three months ended March 31, 2025, net charge-offs decreased $181 million to $123 million compared to the same period in 2024 driven by office loans. We use a number of proactive risk mitigation initiatives to reduce adversely rated exposure in the commercial real estate portfolio, including transfers of deteriorating exposures for management by independent special asset officers and the pursuit of loan restructurings or asset sales to achieve the best results for our customers and the Corporation.

U.S. Small Business Commercial
The U.S. small business commercial loan portfolio is comprised of small business card loans and small business loans primarily managed in
Consumer Banking
. Credit card-related products were 53 percent of the U.S. small business commercial portfolio at both March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024 and represented 98 percent of net charge-offs for the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024. Accruing loans that were past due 90 days or more remained relatively unchanged during the three months ended March 31, 2025.
Nonperforming Commercial Loans, Leases and Foreclosed Properties Activity
Table 30 presents the nonperforming commercial loans, leases and foreclosed properties activity during the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024. Nonperforming loans do not include loans accounted for under the fair value option. During the three months ended March 31, 2025, nonperforming commercial loans and leases increased $142 million to $3.5 billion. At March 31, 2025, nearly 100 percent of commercial nonperforming loans, leases and foreclosed properties were secured, and 36 percent were contractually current. Commercial nonperforming loans were carried at 86 percent of their unpaid principal balance, as the carrying value of these loans has been reduced to the estimated collateral value less costs to sell.
