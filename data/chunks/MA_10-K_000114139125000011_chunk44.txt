Cross-border transactions.
We switch substantially all cross-border transactions using Mastercard, Maestro and Cirrus-branded cards and generate a significant amount of revenue from cross-border volume fees and fees related to switched transactions.  Revenue from switching cross-border and currency conversion transactions for our customers fluctuates with the levels and destinations of cross-border travel and our customers’ need for transactions to be converted into their base currency.  Cross-border activity has been, and may continue to be, adversely affected by world geopolitical, economic, health, weather and other conditions.  These include or have included:
•
Global pandemics (and related post-pandemic global economic impacts) and potential separate outbreaks of flu, viruses and other diseases (any of which could result in future epidemics or pandemics)
•
Current and potential future geopolitical conflicts, as well as expansion into regional or global conflicts, and the resulting impacts to our business
•
The threat of terrorism and major environmental and extreme weather events (including those related to climate change)
The impact of and uncertainty that could result from any of these events or factors could ultimately decrease cross-border activity.  Additionally, any regulation of interregional interchange fees could also negatively impact our cross-border activity (for example, the targets announced by the G20 Financial Stability Board related to cross-border payments).  In each case, decreased cross-border activity could decrease the revenue we receive.
Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
In addition to the cross-border impacts described above, our compliance with sanctions and our decision to suspend our business operations in Russia has led, and could further lead, to other legal ramifications and operational challenges, including fines, the nationalization of our subsidiary and any resulting impacts, and/or lawsuits.
