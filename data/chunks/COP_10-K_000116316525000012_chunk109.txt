Foreign Currency Translation
—Adjustments resulting from the process of translating foreign functional currency financial statements into U.S. dollars are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in common stockholders’ equity. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are included in current earnings. Some of our foreign operations use their local currency as the functional currency.
•
Use of Estimates
—The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results could differ from these estimates.
•
Revenue Recognition
—Revenues associated with the sales of crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, NGLs, LNG and other items are recognized at the point in time when the customer obtains control of the asset. In evaluating when a customer has control of the asset, we primarily consider whether the transfer of legal title and physical delivery has occurred, whether the customer has significant risks and rewards of ownership and whether the customer has accepted delivery and a right to payment exists. These products are typically sold at prevailing market prices. We allocate variable market-based consideration to deliveries (performance obligations) in the current period as that consideration relates specifically to our efforts to transfer control of current period deliveries to the customer and represents the amount we expect to be entitled to in exchange for the related products. Payment is typically due within 30 days or less.
Transactions commonly called buy/sell contracts, in which the purchase and sale of inventory with the same counterparty are entered into “in contemplation” of one another, are combined and reported net (i.e., on the same income statement line).
•
Shipping and Handling Costs
—We typically incur shipping and handling costs prior to control transferring to the customer and account for these activities as fulfillment costs. Accordingly, we include shipping and handling costs in production and operating expenses for production activities. Transportation costs related to marketing activities are recorded in purchased commodities. Freight costs billed to customers are treated as a component of the transaction price and recorded as a component of revenue when the customer obtains control.
•
Cash Equivalents
—Cash equivalents are highly liquid, short-term investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and have original maturities of 90 days or less from their date of purchase. They are carried at cost plus accrued interest, which approximates fair value.
