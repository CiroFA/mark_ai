Significant Transactions
Acquisitions
In April 2025, we acquired Nitel, a network-as-a-service managed service provider, for total cash consideration of $
1.3
billion. The acquisition will enhance our ability to serve and provide connectivity solutions to enterprise customers. Nitel’s results of operations will be included in our condensed consolidated results of operations following the date of acquisition and will be reported in our Business Services Connectivity segment. The assets and liabilities acquired as a result of the transaction will be recorded at their estimated fair values; however, due to the limited time since the acquisition date, the initial acquisition accounting is incomplete.
