the adverse impact of product quality issues can be significant. Actual or perceived design, production, performance, durability or other quality issues related to new product introductions or existing product lines can result in reputational harm to our business, in addition to the potential need for increased inspections and shop visits, and direct warranty, maintenance and other costs that may arise. In addition, a catastrophic product failure or similar event resulting in injuries or death, a fleet grounding or similar systemic consequences could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial position, cash flows and results of operations. Even when there have not been significant or widespread product failures in the field, many of our products and services must function under demanding operating conditions and meet exacting and evolving certification, performance, reliability and durability standards that we, our customers or regulators adopt. Developing and maintaining products that meet or exceed these standards can be costly and technologically challenging, and may also involve extensive coordination of suppliers and highly skilled labor from thousands of workers; a failure to deliver products and services that meet these standards could have significant adverse financial, competitive or reputational effects. Technical, mechanical and other failures occur from time to time, whether as a result of human factors, manufacturing or design defects, or operational process or production issues attributable to us, our customers, suppliers, third-party integrators or others.
In some circumstances we have also incurred, and in the future we may incur, increased costs, delayed payments or lost equipment or services revenue in connection with a significant issue with a third-party product with which our products are integrated, or if parts or other components that we incorporate in our products have defects or other quality issues. For example, a prolonged aircraft grounding, certification or production delays or other adverse developments with aircraft powered by our engines can pose risks to our business. There can be no assurance that the operational processes around sourcing, product design, manufacture, performance and servicing that we or our customers or other third parties have designed to meet rigorous regulatory and quality standards will be sufficient to prevent us or our customers or other third parties from experiencing operational process or product failures and other problems, including through human factors, manufacturing or design defects, process or other failures of contractors or third-party suppliers, cyber-attacks or other intentional acts, software vulnerabilities or malicious software, that could result in potential product, safety, quality, regulatory or environmental risks.
