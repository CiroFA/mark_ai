Technology includes our investments in low-carbon technology opportunities as well as other new technologies or businesses and licensing revenues. Other new technologies or businesses and LNG licensing activities are focused on both conventional and tight oil reservoirs, shale gas, oil sands, enhanced oil recovery as well as LNG. Earnings in Technology decreased due to increased costs in low-carbon and other new technologies and lower licensing revenues.
Other income (expense) or "Other" includes certain foreign currency transaction gains and losses, environmental costs associated with sites no longer in operation, other costs not directly associated with an operating segment, gains or losses on early retirement of debt, holding gains or losses on equity securities and pension settlement expense. Earnings in “Other” increased by $422 million in 2024 compared with 2023. This was primarily due to a tax benefit of $455 million as a result of the acquisition of Marathon Oil and the subsequent utilization of foreign tax credits, and the absence of $89 million loss associated with forward foreign exchange contracts to buy CAD, in support of our acquisition of additional working interest in Surmont in 2023. Decreases to earnings in "Other" were driven by a loss of $147 million associated with the extinguishment of debt in the fourth quarter of 2024.

Financial Indicators
Balance Sheet related line items are shown as of December 31st.
*Capital includes total debt and total equity.
To meet our short- and long-term liquidity requirements, we look to a variety of funding sources, including cash generated from operating activities, our commercial paper and credit facility programs and our ability to sell securities using our shelf registration statement. In 2024, the primary uses of our available cash were $12.1 billion to support our ongoing capital expenditures and investments program, which included $0.4 billion of spend related to fourth-quarter acquisitions; $5.5 billion to repurchase common stock; and $3.6 billion to pay the ordinary dividend and VROC. In addition to cash from operating activities, the other primary sources of capital were $5.6 billion in proceeds from long-term debt issuances, of which $4.1 billion was used to repurchase certain existing Marathon Oil debt assumed in the acquisition and ConocoPhillips debt; and $0.4 billion net sales of short-term investments. In 2024, cash and cash equivalents remained flat with 2023 at $5.6 billion.
