to our unaudited consolidated financial statements contained in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Cash provided by (used for) financing activities in the first quarter of 2024 included a registered public offering of €2.000 billion in aggregate principal amount of euro-denominated senior notes (the 2024 Eurobonds). The 2024 Eurobonds offering resulted in cash proceeds of $2.145 billion, net of investor discounts and issuance costs. We primarily used the net proceeds from the 2024 Eurobonds offering to fund a portion of the purchase price of our acquisition of Axonics and to pay related fees and expenses, and for general corporate purposes. We also used the net proceeds to fund the repayment at maturity of our 3.450% Senior Notes due March 2024 and to pay accrued and unpaid interest with respect to such notes.
Financial Covenant
As of March 31, 2025, we were in compliance with the financial covenant required by the 2021 Revolving Credit Facility.
(1)
Ratio of total debt to deemed consolidated EBITDA, as defined by the 2021 Revolving Credit Facility credit agreement.
The 2021 Revolving Credit Facility includes the financial covenant requirement for all of our credit arrangements that we maintain the maximum permitted leverage ratio of 3.75 times for the remaining term. The credit agreement provides for higher leverage ratios, at our election, for the period following a Qualified Acquisition, as defined by the agreement, for which consideration exceeds $1.000 billion. In the event of such an acquisition, for the four succeeding quarters immediately following, including the quarter in which the acquisition occurs, the maximum permitted leverage ratio is 4.75 times. It steps down for the fifth, sixth and seventh succeeding quarters to 4.50 times, 4.25 times and 4.00 times, respectively. Thereafter, a maximum leverage ratio of 3.75 times is required through the remaining term of the 2021 Revolving Credit Facility. On November 15, 2024, we announced the closing of our acquisition of Axonics, which we had previously designated as a Qualified Acquisition under the credit agreement, increasing the maximum permitted leverage ratio to 4.75 times as of March 31, 2025. We believe that we have the ability to comply with the financial covenant for the next 12 months.
The financial covenant requirement, as amended on May 10, 2024, provides for an exclusion from the calculation of consolidated EBITDA, through maturity, of certain charges and expenses. The credit agreement amendment reset the starting date for purposes of calculating such permitted exclusions related to restructuring charges and restructuring-related expenses from December 31, 2022 to March 31, 2024. Permitted exclusions include up to $500 million in cash and non-cash restructuring charges and restructuring-related expenses associated with our current or future restructuring
