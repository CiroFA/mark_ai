to successfully maintain or grow usage of and engagement with applications that integrate with our products.
We have made and are continuing to make investments to enable developers to build, grow, and monetize applications that integrate with our products. Such existing and prospective developers may not be successful in building, growing, or monetizing applications that create and maintain user engagement.

In some instances, these actions, as well as other actions to enforce our policies applicable to developers, have adversely affected, or
