The changes in
Provision/(benefit) for taxes on income
impacting the effective tax rate year-over-year are summarized below:
2024 v. 2023
The tax benefit of $
28
million for 2024 compared to the tax benefit of $
1.1
billion for 2023 was primarily a result of changes in the jurisdictional mix of earnings partially offset by a tax benefit related to the Transition Tax liability under the TCJA.
2023 v. 2022
The tax benefit of $
1.1
billion for 2023 compared to the tax provision of $
3.3
billion for 2022 was primarily a result of changes in the jurisdictional mix of earnings and the resolution of uncertain tax positions in various markets. The 2023 pre-tax income included a greater percentage of expenses taxed at higher rates as compared to the 2022 pre-tax income, resulting in a 2023 tax benefit compared to the 2022 tax provision. These expenses included amortization expense, acquisition-related costs, restructuring charges and intangible asset impairment charges. The tax benefit for 2023 and the tax provision for 2022 included tax benefits related to global income tax resolutions in multiple tax jurisdictions spanning multiple tax years. The tax provision for 2022 also included the closing of U.S. IRS audits covering five tax years.
In
all
years, federal, state and international net tax liabilities assumed or established as part of a business acquisition are not included in
Provision/(benefit) for taxes on income
(see
Note 2A
