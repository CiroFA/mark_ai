Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Critical Audit Matter
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.
Fair Value of Certain Underlying Investments to determine Performance Allocations and Accrued Performance Allocations — Refer to Notes 2 and 4 to the financial statements
Critical Audit Matter Description
Blackstone, as a general partner, is entitled to an allocation of income from certain carry fund and open-ended structures (“Blackstone Funds”) assuming certain investment returns are achieved, referred to as “Performance Allocations”. Performance Allocations are made based on either cumulative fund performance to date, subject to a preferred return to limited partners or based on fund or vehicle performance over a period of time, subject to a high water mark and preferred return to investors. The change in the fair value of the underlying investments held by the Blackstone Funds is the significant input into this calculation.
As the fair value of underlying investments varies between reporting periods, adjustments are made to amounts recorded as Accrued Performance Allocations to reflect either (a) positive performance resulting in an increase in the Accrued Performance Allocation or (b) negative performance that would cause the amount due to the general partner to be less than the amount previously recognized as revenue, resulting in a negative adjustment to the Accrued Performance Allocation to the general partner.
We considered the valuation of certain investments without readily determinable fair values used in the calculation of Performance Allocations and Accrued Performance Allocations as a critical audit matter because of
