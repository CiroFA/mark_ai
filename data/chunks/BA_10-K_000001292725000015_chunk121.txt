restricted stock units (RSUs) as part of our long-term incentive program with grant date fair values of $

, $

and $
217.48
per unit, respectively. In March 2024, we granted to our executive officers
125,432
RSUs with a grant date fair value of $
192.94
per unit as part of our long-term incentive program. In July 2022, we granted
2,568,112
RSUs with a grant date fair value of $
157.69
per unit as part of our long-term incentive program, accelerating awards planned for 2023 to retain executives. The RSUs granted under this program are generally scheduled to vest and settle in common stock (on a one-for-one basis) on the third anniversary of the grant date. If an executive terminates employment because of retirement, layoff, disability, or death, the executive (or beneficiary) may receive some or all of their stock units depending on certain age and service conditions. In all other cases, the RSUs will not vest and all rights to the stock units will terminate. These RSUs are labeled executive long-term incentive program in the table below.
In addition to RSUs awarded under our long-term incentive programs, we granted RSUs to certain executives and employees. These RSUs are labeled other RSUs in the table below.
The fair values of all RSUs are estimated using the average of the high and low stock prices on the date of grant.
RSU activity for the year ended December 31, 2024 was as follows:

three-year

three-year
performance period may be reduced by
25
% or down to
0
% if two specified product safety operational goals are not timely completed. The PRSUs granted under this program will vest at the payout amount determined on the third anniversary of the grant date and settle in common stock (on a one-for-one basis).
