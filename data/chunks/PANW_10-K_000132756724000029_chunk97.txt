and administrative organizations and incur additional costs to support our business growth, although our general and administrative expense may fluctuate as a percentage of total revenue.
General and administrative expenses increased for fiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023 primarily due to litigation-related charges of $204.4 million in fiscal 2024. Refer to Note 12. Commitments and Contingencies in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information.
INTEREST EXPENSE
Interest expense primarily consists of interest expense related to our 0.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2023 (the “2023 Notes”) and our 0.375% Convertible Senior Notes due 2025 (the “2025 Notes,” and together with “2023 Notes,” the “Notes”).
Interest expense decreased for fiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023 primarily due to maturity of our 2023 Notes in July 2023 and early conversion of our 2025 Notes in fiscal 2024. Refer to Note 10. Debt in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information on the Notes.

Provision for (benefit from) income taxes consists primarily of U.S. taxes, foreign income taxes, and withholding taxes.

This is also the primary driver of the change in our effective tax rate for fiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023. Refer to Note 15.
