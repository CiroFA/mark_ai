Note 17
Taxes
The reconciliation between the U.S. statutory federal income tax rate and the company’s effective income tax rate is detailed in the following table:
1
Includes one-time tax costs (benefits) associated with changes in uncertain tax positions.
2
Includes one-time tax costs (benefits) associated with changes in valuation allowances (2024 - $(
12
); 2023 - $(
84
); 2022 - $(
36
)).

The company’s effective tax rate is reflective of equity income reported on an after-tax basis as part of the “Total Income (Loss) Before Income Tax Expense,” in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Chevron’s share of its equity affiliates’ total income tax expense in 2024 was $
1,286
.
The 2024 increase in income tax expense of $
1,584
and the change in the company’s effective tax rate from
27.6
percent in 2023 to
35.5
percent in 2024 were primarily a result of the tax impacts from the asset sales in Canada.

The company records its deferred taxes on a tax-jurisdiction basis.
The reported deferred tax balances are composed of the following:
Deferred tax liabilities increased by $
1,336
from year-end 2023, driven by deferred tax impacts resulting from the asset sales in Canada and foreign exchange impacts. Deferred tax assets increased by $
1,273
from year-end 2023. This increase was primarily related to increases in foreign tax credits and foreign exchange impacts, partially offset by decreases in tax loss carryforwards and other accrued liabilities.
The overall valuation allowance, which increased by $
897
from year-end 2023, relates to deferred tax assets for U.S. foreign tax credit carryforwards, tax loss carryforwards and temporary differences. The valuation allowance reduces the deferred tax assets to amounts that are, in management’s assessment, more likely than not to be realized. At the end of 2024, the company had gross tax loss carryforwards of approximately $
9,231
and tax credit carryforwards of approximately $
288
, primarily related to various international tax jurisdictions. Whereas some of these tax loss carryforwards do not have an expiration date, others expire at various times from 2025 through 2043. U.S. foreign tax credit carryforwards of $
15,261
will expire between 2025 and 2034.
At December 31, 2024 and 2023, deferred taxes were classified on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as follows:
Income taxes, including U.S. state and foreign withholding taxes, are not accrued for unremitted earnings of international operations that have been or are intended to be
