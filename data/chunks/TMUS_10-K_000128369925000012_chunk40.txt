such that they may no longer be able to operate. Any of these could adversely impact our ability to distribute, market, or sell our products and services.
If we do not successfully deliver new products and services, we may not realize our intended growth targets or generate the expected returns from our business, adversely affecting our financial condition, and operating results.
We continue to expand our offerings beyond traditional wireless services to include High Speed Internet (including fiber broadband), advertising technology and services, and specialized network solutions, such as network slicing for first responders (T-Priority) and 5G advanced network solutions (ANS) for enterprises. These new ventures require significant capital, expertise, and operational support, and their success depends on factors we cannot fully control or predict. Increased competition, technical challenges, security concerns, operational complexities, or shifting regulatory landscapes could delay product rollouts, inflate costs, or limit adoption rates. Additionally, entering new markets or lines of business may expose us to unfamiliar regulatory requirements, compliance challenges, or damage existing customer relationships. Should these new products and services fail to gain traction, generate expected returns, or deliver value to customers, we could incur substantial expenses without offsetting revenue gains, adversely affecting our business, financial condition, and operating results.

We rely on third parties to provide products and services for the operation of our business, and the failure or inability of such parties to provide these products or services could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results.
We have a diverse set of suppliers to help us develop, maintain, and troubleshoot products and services such as wireless and wireline network components, software development services, and billing and customer service support. However, in certain areas such as, billing services, voice, and data communications transport services, wireless or wireline network infrastructure equipment, handsets, other devices, back-office processes and payment processing, there are a limited number of suppliers who can provide adequate support for us, which decreases our flexibility to switch to alternative third parties. Unexpected termination of our arrangement with any of these suppliers or difficulties in renewing our commercial arrangements with them could have a material and adverse effect on our business operations.
Our suppliers are also subject to their own risks, including, but not limited to, cybersecurity, economic, financial and credit conditions, labor force disruptions, geopolitical tensions, disruptions in global supply chain and the risks of natural catastrophic events (such as earthquakes, floods, hurricanes, storms, heatwaves and fires), energy shortages, power outages, equipment failures, terrorist attacks
