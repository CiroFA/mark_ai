Mastercard is not a financial institution.  We do not issue cards, extend credit, determine or receive revenue from interest rates or other fees charged to account holders by issuers (the account holders’ financial institutions), or establish the rates charged by acquirers (the merchants’ financial institutions) in connection with merchants’ acceptance of our products.  In most cases, account holder relationships belong to, and are managed by, our customers.
