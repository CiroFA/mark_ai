months ended March 31, 2025, compared to $29 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024. We expect revenue from Lease Buyouts to fluctuate period to period depending on the timing of when, and if, customers choose to exercise buyout options embedded in their leases.
The da Vinci surgical system ASP, excluding systems placed under fixed-payment or usage-based operating lease arrangements, Ion systems, and the impact of specified-price trade-in rights, was approximately $1.62 million for the three months ended March 31, 2025, compared to approximately $1.38 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024. The higher first quarter 2025 ASP was largely driven by favorable product mix, including from da Vinci 5 sales, and lower pricing discounts. ASP fluctuates from period to period based on geographic and product mix, product pricing, systems placed involving trade-ins, and changes in foreign exchange rates.
During the first quarter of 2025, 49 Ion systems were placed compared to 70 systems during the first quarter of 2024. By geography, 45 systems were placed in the U.S., three in Europe, and one in other markets during first quarter of 2025, compared to 66 systems placed in the U.S. and four in Europe during the first quarter of 2024. In the U.S., where we estimate that penetration of lung biopsy is approaching the halfway point, our customers’ focus has begun to shift from increasing

capacity to increasing utilization of their existing systems. As of March 31, 2025, we had an Ion system installed base of approximately 853 systems, compared to an installed base of approximately 604 systems as of March 31, 2024.
The following table summarizes our Ion system placements and systems installed at customers under leasing arrangements:
Service Revenue
Service revenue increased by 16% to $363 million for the three months ended March 31, 2025, compared to $314 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024. The increase in service revenue was primarily driven by a larger installed base of systems producing service revenue.
Gross Profit
Product
Product gross profit for the three months ended March 31, 2025, increased by 19% to $1.22 billion, representing 64.5% of product revenue, compared to $1.02 billion, representing 64.8% of product revenue, for the three months ended March 31, 2024. The lower product gross profit margin for the three months ended March 31, 2025, was primarily driven by higher costs associated with our da Vinci 5 surgical system, incremental fixed overhead costs, including depreciation expense, associated with expanded manufacturing capacity, and higher scrap, partially offset by lower excess and obsolete inventory charges. The impact of tariffs for the three months ended March 31, 2025, was immaterial.
Product gross profit for the three months ended March 31, 2025, and 2024, included share-based compensation expense of $30.2 million and $22.7 million, respectively, and intangible assets amortization expense of $2.2 million
