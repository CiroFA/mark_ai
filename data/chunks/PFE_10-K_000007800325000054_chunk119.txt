Costs and Expenses
2024 v. 2023
Cost of Sales
Cost of sales
decreased $7.1 billion, primarily due to:
•
the non-recurrence of a non-cash charge of $6.2 billion in 2023 related to Paxlovid and Comirnaty recorded for inventory write-offs and related charges ($5.0 billion for Paxlovid and $1.2 billion for Comirnaty); and
•
a favorable change in sales mix of $2.6 billion, primarily driven by lower sales of Comirnaty,
partially offset by:
•
an impact of $1.9 billion from our Seagen acquisition, inclusive of the amortization of the fair value step-up of inventory.
The decrease in
Cost of sales
as a percentage of revenues reflects the non-recurrence of the aforementioned non-cash charge of $6.2 billion, as well as significantly lower sales of Comirnaty.
Certain of our vaccines, including Comirnaty, are subject to seasonality of demand, with a greater portion of revenues and related cost of sales anticipated in the fall and winter seasons. See also
