Capital Return Program
Share Repurchase
Our board of directors has authorized a share repurchase program of our Class A common stock, which commenced in January 2017 and does not have an expiration date. As of December 31, 2023, $
30.93
billion remained available and authorized for repurchases under this program. In January 2024, an additional $
50
billion of repurchases was authorized under this program. In 2024, we repurchased and subsequently retired
65
million shares of our Class A common stock for an aggregate amount of $
29.75
billion, which includes the 1% excise tax accruals as a result of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. As of December 31, 2024, $
51.28
billion remained available and authorized for repurchases.
The timing and actual number of shares repurchased under the repurchase program depend on a variety of factors, including price, general business and market conditions, and other investment opportunities. Shares may be repurchased through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, including through the use of trading plans intended to qualify under Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
Dividend
Beginning in February 2024, our board of directors declared quarterly cash dividend of $
0.50
per share to the holders of our Class A and Class B common stock. RSUs granted on or after March 1, 2024 under our 2012 Equity Incentive Plan (Amended 2012 Plan), which was most recently amended in May 2024, are entitled to dividend equivalent rights. During the year ended December 31, 2024, total dividend and dividend equivalent payments were $
4.38
billion and $
691
million for Class A and Class B common stock, respectively.
Subject to legally available funds and future declaration by our board of directors, we currently intend to continue to pay a quarterly cash dividend on our outstanding common stock. The declaration and payment of future dividends is at the sole discretion of our board of directors after taking into account various factors, including our financial condition, operating results, available cash, and current and anticipated cash needs.
Share-based Compensation Plan
We have
one
active share-based employee compensation plan, the 2012 Equity Incentive Plan (Amended 2012 Plan), which was most recently amended in May 2024. Our Amended 2012 Plan provides for the issuance of incentive and nonqualified stock options, restricted stock awards, stock appreciation rights, RSUs, performance shares, and stock bonuses to qualified employees, directors, and consultants. Shares that are withheld in connection with the net settlement of RSUs or forfeited are added to the reserves of the Amended 2012 Plan.
