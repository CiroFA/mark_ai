Our growth may not be sustainable and depends on our ability to attract new merchants, retain existing merchants, retain revenue from existing merchants and increase sales to both new and existing merchants.
We principally generate revenues through the sale of subscriptions to our platform and the sale of additional solutions to our merchants. Our merchants have no obligation to renew their subscriptions after their subscription term expires, and new merchants joining our platform may decide not to continue or renew their subscriptions for reasons outside of our control.
