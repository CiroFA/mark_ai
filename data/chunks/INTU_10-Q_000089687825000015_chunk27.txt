Our strategy, combined with our five Big Bets that focus on the largest customer problems and growth opportunities, positions us for durable growth in the future. Our scale of data, our investment in AI capabilities such as knowledge engineering, machine learning, and generative AI (GenAI), and our network of AI-powered virtual experts give us significant advantage as we deliver reimagined customer experiences.
With the introduction of GenAI, we are transforming how we strive to serve our customers by delivering “done for you” experiences, where we do the hard work for them, and connecting them with AI-powered human expertise to fuel their success. We use powerful and relevant contextual data sets spanning small and mid-market businesses, consumer finance, and tax to deliver personalized financial insights to customers across our platform.
Additionally, our investment in AI, GenAI, data, and world-class developer tools in particular, provides a foundation for us to accelerate productivity, innovate at scale, and move with speed to deliver benefits to our customers. This includes utilizing our own financial large language models (LLMs), as well as models from other leaders in GenAI, which together unlock new opportunities to serve our customers with accuracy and speed in a cost-efficient way.
