Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging at NVIDIA
We believe that diverse teams fuel innovation, and we are committed to creating an inclusive culture that supports all our employees.
When recruiting new talent or developing our current employees, we strive to build a diverse talent pipeline that includes those underrepresented in the technology field, including women, Black/African American, and Hispanic/Latino candidates.
To this end, we:
•
Hire, promote and compensate our employees based on merit;
•
Partner with institutions and professional organizations serving historically underrepresented communities;
•
Enlist dedicated recruiting teams to shepherd underrepresented candidates through the interview process and identify internal opportunities;
•
Support the development and growth of women employees through programs aimed at building a pipeline of future leaders;
•
Provide peer support and executive sponsors for our internal community resource groups;
•
Provide training and education to managers and peers on fostering supportive environments that allow all our employees to do their best work;
•
Track equity and parity in retention, promotions, pay, and employee engagement scores; and
•
Measure year over year progress and provide leadership visibility on talent and diversity efforts.
As of the end of fiscal year 2025, our global workforce was 78% male, 21% female, and 1% not declared, with 6% of our workforce in the United States composed of Black or African American and Hispanic or Latino employees.
Flexible Working Environment
We support a flexible work environment allowing us to recruit the very best employees, regardless of where they live. This flexibility supports diverse hiring, retention of talent, including working parents and other caregivers and employee engagement, which we believe makes NVIDIA a great place to work. We also provide company-wide 2-days off per quarter for employees to rest and recharge.
