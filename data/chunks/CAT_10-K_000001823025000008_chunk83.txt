decreased in 2024, compared to an increase in 2023.
Total dealer inventory increased about $400 million during 2024, compared to an increase of about $2.1 billion during 2023. Machine dealer inventory decreased about $700 million during 2024, compared to an increase of $700 million during 2023. Dealers are independent, and the reasons for changes in their inventory levels vary, including their expectations of future demand and product delivery times. Dealers’ demand expectations take into account seasonal changes, macroeconomic conditions, machine rental rates and other factors. Delivery times can vary based on availability of product from Caterpillar factories and product distribution centers. We do not expect a significant change in machine dealer inventories in 2025.

Operating profit was $13.072 billion in 2024, an increase of $106 million, or 1 percent, compared with $12.966 billion in 2023. The profit impact of lower sales volume of $1.298 billion, higher selling, general and administrative (SG&A) and research and development (R&D) expenses of $201 million, and higher restructuring costs of $165 million were more than offset by favorable price realization of $1.238 billion, the absence of the impact of the divestiture of the company's Longwall business in 2023 of $586 million and favorable manufacturing costs of $246 million. The increase in SG&A/R&D expenses was primarily driven by investments aligned with strategic initiatives. Favorable manufacturing costs largely reflected lower freight.
For the twelve months ended December 31, 2024, restructuring costs increased primarily due to the divestitures of certain non-U.S. entities.
Operating profit margin was 20.2 percent in 2024, compared with 19.3 percent in 2023.
