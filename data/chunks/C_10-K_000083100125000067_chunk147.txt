quantitative component of expected credit losses, due to changes in the length and severity of forecasted economic variables or events in the respective scenarios. Citi’s downside scenario incorporates more adverse macroeconomic assumptions than the weighted scenario assumptions. To demonstrate this sensitivity, if Citi applied
130
100% weight to the downside scenario as of December 31, 2024 to reflect the most severe economic deterioration forecast in the macroeconomic scenarios, there would have been a hypothetical incremental increase in the ACL of approximately $5.3 billion related to lending exposures, except for loans individually evaluated for credit losses and other financial assets carried at amortized cost.
This analysis does not incorporate any impacts or changes to the qualitative component of the ACL. These factors could change the outcome of the sensitivity analysis based on historical experience and current conditions at the time of the assessment. Given the uncertainty inherent in macroeconomic forecasting, Citi continues to believe that its ACL estimate based on a three probability-weighted macroeconomic scenario approach combined with the qualitative component remains appropriate as of December 31, 2024.
4Q24 Changes in the ACL
As further discussed below, Citi’s ending ACL balance for the fourth quarter of 2024 was $22.2 billion, a slight increase from September 30, 2024. The net build of $0.3 billion in the quarter was primarily driven by growth in cards balances in
USPB
. Citi believes its analysis of the ACL reflects the forward view of the economic environment as of December 31, 2024. See Note 16 for additional information.
Consumer Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans
Citi’s consumer ACLL is largely driven by U.S. cards (Branded Cards and Retail Services) in
USPB
. Citi’s total consumer ACLL build was $0.3 billion in the fourth quarter of 2024, primarily driven by growth in U.S. cards balances. This resulted in a December 31, 2024 ACLL balance of $16.0 billion, or 4.08% of total funded consumer loans.
For U.S. cards, the level of reserves relative to total funded loans decreased to 7.93% at December 31, 2024, due to seasonal improvement, compared to 8.15% at September 30, 2024. For the remaining consumer exposures, the level of reserves relative to total funded loans was 1.11% at December 31, 2024, compared to 1.08% at September 30, 2024.
Corporate Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans
Citi had a corporate ACLL release of less than $0.1 billion in the fourth quarter of 2024, largely driven by a release for specific risks and uncertainties impacting vulnerable industries and regions in
Banking
and lower transfer risk associated with exposures outside the U.S., driven by safety and soundness considerations under U.S. banking law in
Services
,
partially offset by a build for changes in portfolio composition in
Markets
. This resulted in a December 31, 2024 ACLL balance of $2.6 billion, or 0.87% of total funded corporate loans.
