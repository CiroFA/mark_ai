such conversion (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share), we will be required to make cash payments in respect of the Convertible Notes being converted. However, any future debt may contain limitations on our ability to (i) pay cash upon conversion or redemption of the Convertible Notes, which may require us to elect to deliver solely shares of our class A common stock to settle such conversion (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share), or (ii) sell certain bitcoin to generate cash that can be used to make such cash payments. Upon a fundamental change as defined in the indentures governing the Convertible Notes, the holders of such notes will have the right to require us to offer to purchase all of the applicable notes then outstanding at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Convertible Notes, plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the repurchase date. Moreover, the exercise by holders of the Convertible Notes of their right to require us to repurchase such Convertible Notes could cause a default under future debt agreements, even if the change of control or fundamental change itself does not, due to the financial effect of such repurchase on us. In order to obtain sufficient funds to pay the purchase price of such notes, we expect that we would have to refinance the Convertible Notes or obtain a waiver from the applicable holders of Convertible Notes and we may not be able to refinance the Convertible Notes on reasonable terms, if at all. Absent a waiver from the applicable holders of Convertible Notes, our failure to offer to purchase all applicable Convertible Notes or to purchase all validly tendered Convertible Notes would be an event of default under the indentures governing the Convertible Notes. In addition, holders of (i) the 2028 Convertible Notes have the right to require us to repurchase all or a portion of their notes on September 15, 2027, (ii) the 2029 Convertible Notes have the right to require us to repurchase all or a portion of their notes on June 1, 2028, (iii) the 2030 Convertible Notes and the 2031 Convertible Notes have the right to require us to repurchase all or a portion of their notes on September 15, 2028, and (iv) the 2032 Convertible Notes have the right to require us to repurchase all or a portion of their notes on June 15, 2029,

in each case, at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any.
The conditional conversion feature of the Convertible Notes, if triggered, may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results
In the event the conditional conversion feature of the Convertible Notes is triggered, holders of the applicable Convertible Notes will be entitled to convert such notes at any time during specified periods at their option. If one or more holders elect to convert their Convertible Notes, unless we
