Income Taxes
Our tax provision for interim periods is determined using an estimated annual effective tax rate, adjusted for discrete items arising in that quarter, including excess tax benefits or shortfall tax expenses from share-based compensation and changes in unrecognized tax benefits. In each quarter, we update the estimated annual effective tax rate and make a year-to-date adjustment to the provision. The estimated annual effective tax rate is subject to significant volatility due to several factors, including our ability to accurately predict the proportion of our income (loss) before provision for income taxes in multiple jurisdictions, the U.S. tax benefits from foreign derived intangible income, and the effects of tax law changes.
Our gross unrecognized tax benefits were $
16.01
billion and $
15.13
billion as of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively. These unrecognized tax benefits were primarily accrued for the uncertainties with our research tax credits and transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries, which include licensing of intellectual property, providing services and other transactions. If the gross unrecognized tax benefits as of March 31, 2025 were realized in a future period, this would result in a tax benefit of $
10.79
billion within our provision for income taxes at such time. The amount of interest and penalties accrued was $
2.47
billion and $
2.21
billion as of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively. We expect to continue to accrue unrecognized tax benefits for certain recurring tax positions.
In July 2016, we received a Statutory Notice of Deficiency (Notice) from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) related to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries in conjunction with the examination of the 2010 tax year. While the Notice applies only to the 2010 tax year, the IRS stated that it will also apply its position for tax years subsequent to 2010 and has done so in years covered by the second Notice described below. We do not agree with the position of the IRS and have filed a petition in the Tax Court challenging the Notice. On January 15, 2020, the
