The fair value of contingent consideration liabilities is impacted by the passage of time and multiple other inputs, including the probability of success of achieving regulatory milestones, discount rates, the estimated amount of future sales of the acquired products and other market-based factors. For the three months ended March 31, 2025, the change in fair value reflected higher estimated Skyrizi sales, the passage of time and lower discount rates.
