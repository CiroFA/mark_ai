material default on interest or principal payments for our debt securities.
Realized gains and losses on sales of available-for-sale investments are computed based upon specific identification of the initial cost adjusted for any other-than-temporary declines in fair value that were recorded in earnings and were not material for the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024. Proceeds from sales of available-for-sale investments were $
41.6
million and $
24.4
million for the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively.

Fair Value of Investments
The following table summarizes certain fair value information at March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024 for investment assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis, as well as the carrying amount and amortized cost of certain other investments:
(1)
For available-for-sale debt securities, amounts disclosed represent the securities' amortized cost.
(2)
We consider all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less from the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. The cost of these investments approximates fair value.
(3)
Fair value disclosures are not applicable for equity method investments and investments accounted for under the measurement alternative for equity investments.
17
We determine our Level 1 and Level 2 fair value measurements based on a market approach using quoted market values, significant other observable inputs for identical or comparable assets or liabilities, or discounted cash flow analyses. Level 3 fair value measurements for other investment securities are determined using unobservable inputs, including the investments' cost adjusted for impairments and price changes from orderly transactions. Fair values are not readily available for certain equity investments measured under the measurement alternative.
