year-end 2023, ending 2024 at 11.6%, primarily as a result of lower total assets and 2024 net income.
In light of the Federal Reserve’s 2023 regulatory capital rule proposal, which, among other things, would require the Company to include AOCI in regulatory capital, the Company has developed an adjusted Tier 1 Leverage Ratio, which is a non-GAAP and non-regulatory capital financial measure that includes AOCI in the ratio. The primary component of AOCI for Schwab is unrealized gains and losses on our AFS investment securities portfolio and on securities transferred from AFS to the HTM category.
During the second quarter of 2024, Schwab updated its long-term operating objective to be its consolidated adjusted Tier 1 Leverage Ratio of 6.75% - 7.00%. As of December 31, 2024, our adjusted Tier 1 Leverage Ratio, which includes AOCI in the

ratio, was 6.8% for CSC (consolidated) and 7.3% for CSB (see Non-GAAP Financial Measures for further details and a reconciliation of such measures to GAAP reported results). The Company is continuing to accrete capital organically, and will continue to manage its capital as described above. In evaluating returns of excess capital to stockholders, we will consider the amount of bank supplemental funding outstanding, and may choose to utilize the liquidity we would otherwise use for capital returns to repay outstanding bank supplemental funding balances. See also below and Item 8 – Note 28 for additional information regarding share repurchase activity subsequent to December 31, 2024.
IDA Agreement
Certain brokerage client deposits are swept off-balance sheet to the TD Depository Institutions pursuant to the 2023 IDA agreement. During 2024 and 2023, Schwab did not move IDA balances to its balance sheet. The Company’s overall capital management strategy includes supporting migration of IDA balances in future periods as available pursuant to the terms of the 2023 IDA agreement. The Company’s ability to migrate these balances to its balance sheet is dependent upon multiple factors including having sufficient capital levels to sustain these incremental deposits. See Item 8 – Note 15 for further information on the 2023 IDA agreement.
Dividends
Since the initial dividend in 1989, and as of December 31, 2024, CSC has paid 143 consecutive quarterly dividends and has increased the quarterly dividend rate 28 times, resulting in a 19% compounded annual growth rate, excluding the special cash dividend of $1.00 per common share in 2007. While the payment and amount of dividends are at the discretion of the Board of Directors, subject to certain regulatory and other restrictions, CSC currently targets its common and nonvoting common stock cash dividend at approximately 20% to 30% of net income.
The Board of Directors of the Company declared a quarterly
