As a result, the full extent of liability under our insurance or reinsurance contracts may not be known for many years after a contract is issued.

Changes in regulations and regulatory actions can adversely affect our operating results and our ability to allocate capital.
Our insurance businesses are subject to regulation in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Such regulations may relate to, among other things, the types of business that can be written, the rates that can be charged for coverage, the level of capital that must be maintained and restrictions on the types and size of investments that can be made. Regulations may also restrict the timing and amount of dividend payments to Berkshire by these businesses.

To the extent that changes in government policies limit or restrict the usage of coal as a fuel source in generating electricity or alternate fuels, such as natural gas, or otherwise displace coal as an energy source, revenues and earnings could be adversely affected. As a common carrier, BNSF is also required to transport toxic inhalation hazard chemicals and other hazardous materials. A release of hazardous
