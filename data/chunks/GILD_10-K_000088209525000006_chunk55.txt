For example, we entered into an agreement with LEO Pharma A/S in early 2025 to develop and commercialize their pre-clinical oral signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 programs for the potential treatment of inflammatory diseases. In addition, as part of our overall investment approach to fund the advancement of our pipeline and commercialization of our products, we will continue to focus on disciplined operating expense management.
Our ability to deliver on our strategy and 2025 objectives is subject to a number of uncertainties. Please refer to Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a listing of risk factors that could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.

Biktarvy sales increased primarily due to higher demand, including patients switching from Genvoya and other Gilead HIV products. To a lesser extent, the increase was also due to higher average realized price.

Descovy sales increased primarily due to higher demand, partially offset by lower average realized price.
