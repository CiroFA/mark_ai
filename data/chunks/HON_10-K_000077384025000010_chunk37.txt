Our credit ratings are periodically reviewed by the major independent debt-rating agencies. As of December 31, 2024, S&P Global Inc. (S&P), Fitch Ratings Inc. (Fitch), and Moody’s Investor Service (Moody's) have ratings on our debt set forth in the table below:
CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS
Following is a summary of our significant contractual obligations and probable liability payments as of December 31, 2024:
ASBESTOS MATTERS
Payments, net of insurance recoveries, related to known asbestos matters were $209 million, $109 million, and $166 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively, and are estimated to be approximately $157 million in 2025. We expect to make payments associated with these asbestos matters from operating cash flows. The timing of these payments depends on several factors, including the timing of litigation and settlements of liability claims. In early 2023, we made payments of approximately $1.3 billion in connection with the NARCO Buyout. For additional information regarding the NARCO Buyout, see Note 19

Accruals for environmental matters deemed probable and reasonably estimable were $261 million, $222 million, and $186 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. In addition, for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, we incurred operating costs for ongoing businesses of approximately $124 million, $110 million, and $71 million, respectively, relating to compliance with environmental regulations.
Payments related to known environmental matters were $224 million, $196 million, and $211 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively, and are estimated to be approximately $244 million in 2025. We expect to make payments associated with these environmental matters from operating cash flows. The timing of these payments depends on several factors, including the timing of litigation and settlements of remediation liability, personal injury and property damage claims, regulatory approval of cleanup projects, execution timeframe of projects, remedial techniques to be utilized, and agreement with other parties.
Reimbursements from Resideo for payments related to environmental matters at certain sites, as defined in the indemnification and reimbursement agreement, were $140 million in 2024 and are expected to be $140 million in 2025.
