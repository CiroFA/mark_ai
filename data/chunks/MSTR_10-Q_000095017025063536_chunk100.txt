Risks Related to Our Preferred Stock
Our Perpetual Strike Preferred Stock is senior to our class A common stock, but junior to our Perpetual Strife Preferred Stock, and our Perpetual Strike Preferred Stock and Perpetual Strife Preferred Stock are junior to our existing and future indebtedness, structurally junior to the liabilities of our subsidiaries and subject to the rights and preferences of any other class or series of preferred stock that we may issue in the future
If we liquidate, dissolve or wind up, whether voluntarily or involuntarily, then our assets will be available to distribute to our equity holders, including holders of our class A common stock, Perpetual Strike Preferred Stock and Perpetual Strife Preferred Stock, only if all of our then-outstanding indebtedness is first paid in full.

If any assets remain after any liquidation senior stock is paid in full, those assets will first be distributed pro rata to our holders of Perpetual Strife Preferred Stock and any series of preferred stock with liquidation parity with our Perpetual Strife Preferred Stock, then pro rata among holders of our Perpetual Strike Preferred Stock and any series of preferred stock with liquidation parity with our Perpetual Strike Preferred Stock, with any remaining assets distributed to holders of our common stock. There may be insufficient remaining assets available to pay the liquidation preference and unpaid accumulated dividends on our Perpetual Strife Preferred Stock, in which case holders of our Perpetual Strike Preferred Stock and common stock would not receive any value for their shares.
If we issue any dividend senior stock in the future, such dividend senior stock could contain provisions that prohibit us from paying accumulated dividends on our Perpetual Strike Preferred Stock or Perpetual Strife Preferred Stock, or from purchasing, redeeming or acquiring our Perpetual Strike Preferred Stock or Perpetual Strife Preferred Stock until and unless we first pay accumulated
