Board Oversight of Human Capital Management
BlackRock’s Board of Directors (the “Board”) plays an important role in the oversight of human capital management and devotes one Board meeting annually to an in-depth review of BlackRock’s culture, talent development, retention and recruiting initiatives, human capital management strategy, leadership and succession planning and employee feedback. Moreover, the Board’s Management Development and Compensation Committee periodically reviews efforts and developments related to the firm’s human capital management strategy.

An important element of the succession planning across the organization is a commitment to building leadership from within.
