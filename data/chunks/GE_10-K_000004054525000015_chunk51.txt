software in a product used by a partner or supplier to deliver a service or embedded in a product that is later integrated into a GE Aerospace product could lead to a vulnerability in the security of GE Aerospaceâ€™s product or, if used internally in our network environment, to a compromise of the GE Aerospace network, which may lead to the loss of information or operational disruptions.
Cybersecurity-related and data privacy and protection laws and regulatory regimes are evolving, can vary significantly by country and present increasing compliance challenges, and we from time to time receive, and in the future will likely receive, regulatory inquiries about specific incidents or aspects of our cybersecurity framework; these dynamics increase our costs, affect our competitiveness and can expose us to fines or other penalties and reputational risks.

Our business and operating results have been, and will continue to be, affected by worldwide economic conditions, including conditions in the aerospace and defense sector. Activity in our sector is also particularly influenced by the actions of a
