fair value.
We estimate the fair values for non-qualified stock options using the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions:
We use market-based measures of implied volatility to determine expected volatility on all options granted. We determine expected lives of options based on the historical option exercise experience of our option holders using a rolling
10-year
average.
Expected dividend yields are based on the annualized approved quarterly dividend rate and the current market price of our common stock at the time of grant. No assumption for a future dividend rate change is included unless there is an approved plan to change the dividend in the near term.
