Given our role in the financial, commodities and automotive markets, our ability to attract and retain customers is uniquely affected by external perceptions of our reputation, credibility, and brand.

We provide credit ratings, pricing and valuation services, benchmark products, indices, and ESG scores and data, many of which depend on contributions or inputs from third parties or market participants. Our customers and other market participants expect us to be able to demonstrate that our products and services are produced independently and are not readily subject to manipulation.

Our divisions are all actively engaged in analyzing and providing views on economic conditions, including assessing the impact of events that create volatility and economic uncertainty, such as the ongoing military conflicts between Russia and Ukraine and in the Middle East and tensions across the Taiwan Strait. Notwithstanding the care we take in carrying out our work, the views and assumptions we express, the
