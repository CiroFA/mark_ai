claims, actions, inquiries, or investigations could require us to pay substantial damages or fines, undertake service actions, initiate recall campaigns, or take other costly actions. It is therefore possible that legal judgments or investigations could give rise to expenses that are not covered, or not fully covered, by our insurance programs and could affect our financial position and results.
We are currently subject to a consolidated multidistrict class action lawsuit in the Northern District of Illinois alleging that we have engaged in attempted monopolization, exclusionary conduct, and restraint of the market for repair services for John Deere brand agricultural equipment by limiting repair resources only to our authorized technicians or independent authorized John Deere dealers. In addition, the FTC, along with the Attorneys General of the States of Arizona, Illinois, Michigan, Minnesota, and Wisconsin, filed a lawsuit against us in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois Western Division alleging similar claims. We are currently unable to predict the outcome of these matters.
