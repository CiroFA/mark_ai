disruptions to our or our third parties’ critical business operations and client services are possible, such as due to computer, telecommunications, network, utility, electronic or physical infrastructure outages, including from abuse or failure of our electronic trading and algorithmic platforms, significant unplanned increases in client transactions, fraudulent transactions, cyberattacks, aging information systems, newly introduced or identified vulnerabilities or defects in key hardware and software, failure of or defects in infrastructure or manual processes, technology project implementation challenges and supply chain disruptions. Operational disruptions and prolonged operational outages could also result from events arising from natural disasters, including acute and chronic weather events, such as wildfires, tornadoes, hurricanes and floods, some of which are happening with more frequency and severity, and earthquakes, as well as local or larger scale political or social matters, including civil unrest, terrorist acts and military conflict.
We continue to have greater reliance on our and our third parties’ remote access tools and technology, and employees’ personal systems and increased data utilization and dependence upon our information systems to operate our businesses, including from evolving client preferences, which has led to increased reliance on digital banking and other digital services provided by our businesses. Effective management of our business continuity increasingly depends on the security, reliability and adequacy of such systems.
We also rely on our employees, representatives and third parties in our day-to-day operations, who may, due to illness, unavailability, the emergence of widespread health emergencies or pandemics, human error, misconduct (including errors in judgment, malice, fraud or illegal activity), malfeasance or a failure, breach or misuse of information systems, cause disruptions to our organization and expose us to operational losses, regulatory risk and reputational harm. Our and our third parties’ inability to properly introduce, deploy and manage operational or technology changes and continuously alter, improve and automate processes and systems, including related controls, such as regarding internal financial and governance processes, existing products and services, and new product innovations and technology, could also result in additional operational, information security, reputational  and regulatory risk, including from the use of artificial intelligence (AI), such as machine learning and generative AI.
Regardless of the measures we have taken to implement training, procedures, controls, backup systems and other safeguards to support our operations and bolster our operational resilience, our ability to conduct business may be adversely affected by significant failures or disruptions to us or to third parties with whom we interact or upon whom we rely, including localized or systemic cyber
