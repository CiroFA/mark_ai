Results of operations
Our strategic focus is on analog and embedded processing products. We sell our products into six end markets: industrial, automotive, personal electronics, enterprise systems, communications equipment and other. While all of these end markets represent good opportunities, we place additional strategic emphasis on designing and selling our products into the industrial and automotive markets, which we believe represent the best long-term growth opportunities.
Our focus on analog and embedded processing allows us to generate strong cash flow from operations. Our cash flow from operations of $6.32 billion underscored the strength of our business model, the quality of our product portfolio and the benefit of 300mm production. Free cash flow was $1.50 billion and represented 9.6% of revenue. During 2024, we invested $3.75 billion in R&D and SG&A, invested $4.82 billion in capital expenditures and returned $5.72 billion to shareholders.
Details of financial results – 2024 compared with 2023
Revenue of $15.64 billion decreased $1.88 billion, or 10.7%, due to lower revenue from Analog and Embedded Processing.
Gross profit of $9.09 billion was down $1.93 billion, or 17.5%, primarily due to lower revenue and, to a lesser extent, higher manufacturing costs associated with our planned capacity expansions. As a percentage of revenue, gross profit decreased to 58.1% from 62.9%.
Operating expenses (R&D and SG&A) were $3.75 billion compared with $3.69 billion.
