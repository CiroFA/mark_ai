believe to be prudent instrument selection. We limit our direct exposure to securities in any one industry or issuer.
In 2021, we entered into our $2.750 billion revolving credit facility (as amended, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the 2021 Revolving Credit Facility) with a global syndicate of commercial banks. The 2021 Revolving Credit Facility has a maturity date of May 10, 2029. This facility provides backing for our commercial paper program, and outstanding commercial paper directly reduces borrowing capacity under the 2021 Revolving Credit Facility. There were no amounts outstanding under the 2021 Revolving Credit Facility or our commercial paper program as of March 31, 2025, resulting in an additional $2.750 billion of available liquidity.
