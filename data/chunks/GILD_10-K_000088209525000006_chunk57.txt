Research and Development Expenses
Research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel costs including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation expense, infrastructure, materials and supplies and other support costs, research and clinical studies performed by contract research organizations and our collaboration partners and other outside services.
We manage our R&D expenses by identifying the R&D activities we expect to be performed during a given period and then prioritizing efforts based on scientific data, probability of successful technical development and regulatory approval, market potential, available human and capital resources and other considerations. We regularly review our R&D activities based on unmet medical need and, as necessary, reallocate resources among our internal R&D portfolio and external opportunities that we believe will best support the long-term growth of our business. We do not track total R&D expenses by product candidate, therapeutic area or development phase.
The following table provides a breakout of expenses by major cost type:
Research and development expenses increased 3% to $5.9 billion in 2024, compared to 2023.
Personnel, infrastructure and other support costs increased mainly due to higher compensation expenses, increases in restructuring costs, and stock-based compensation expenses and other integration costs related to the acquisition of CymaBay.
Clinical studies and other costs decreased mainly due to timing of clinical activities, including the wind-down of studies for magrolimab and obeldesivir for treatment of COVID-19, and higher R&D reimbursements, partially offset by increases related to the progression of other studies.
Acquired In-Process Research and Development Expenses
Acquired in-process research and development expenses are recorded when incurred and reflect costs of externally-developed IPR&D projects, acquired directly in a transaction other than a business combination, that do not have an alternative future use, including upfront and pre-commercialization milestone payments related to various collaborations and the costs of rights to IPR&D projects.
