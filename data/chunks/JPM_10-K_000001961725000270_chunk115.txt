(such as clearing and payment systems, CCPs and securities exchanges). These external operational systems with which JPMorgan is connected, whether directly or indirectly, can be sources of operational risk to JPMorganChase. JPMorganChase may be exposed not only to a systems failure or cyber attack that may be experienced by a vendor or market infrastructure with which JPMorganChase is directly connected, but also to a systems breakdown or cyber attack involving another party to which such a vendor or infrastructure is connected. Similarly, retailers, payment systems and processors, data aggregators and other external parties with which JPMorganChase’s customers do business can increase JPMorganChase’s operational risk. This is particularly the case where activities of customers or other parties are beyond JPMorganChase’s security and control systems, including through the use of the internet, cloud computing services, and personal smart phones and other mobile devices or services.
If an external party obtains access to customer account data on JPMorganChase’s systems, whether authorized or unauthorized, and that party misappropriates that data, this could result in negative outcomes for JPMorganChase and its clients and customers, including a heightened risk of fraudulent transactions using JPMorganChase’s systems, losses from fraudulent transactions and reputational harm arising from the perception that JPMorganChase’s systems may not be secure.
As JPMorganChase’s interconnectivity with clients, customers and other external parties continues to expand, JPMorganChase increasingly faces the risk of operational failure or cyber attacks with respect to the systems of those parties. Security breaches affecting JPMorganChase’s clients or customers, or systems breakdowns or failures, security breaches or human error or misconduct affecting other external parties, may require JPMorganChase to take steps to protect the integrity of its own operational systems or to safeguard confidential information, including restricting the access of customers to their accounts. These actions can increase JPMorganChase’s
operational costs and potentially diminish customer satisfaction and confidence in JPMorganChase.
Furthermore, the widespread and expanding interconnectivity among financial institutions, clearing banks, CCPs, payments processors, financial technology companies, securities exchanges, clearing houses and other financial market infrastructures increases the risk that the disruption of an operational system involving one institution or entity, including due to a cyber attack, may cause industry-wide operational disruptions that could materially affect JPMorganChase’s ability to conduct business. In addition, the risks associated with the disruption of an operational system of a third party could be exacerbated to the extent that the services provided by that system are used by a significant number or proportion of market participants.
