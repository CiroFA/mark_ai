restrictions or other structural or behavioral remedies) that could limit the anticipated benefits of the transaction;
•
entry into markets in which we have minimal prior experience and where competitors in such markets have stronger market positions;
•
inability to retain personnel, key customers, distributors, vendors and other business partners of the acquired business;
•
delay in customer and distributor purchasing decisions due to uncertainty about the direction of our product and service offerings;
•
incurring higher than anticipated costs to effectively integrate an acquired business, to bring an acquired company into compliance with applicable laws and regulations, additional compensation issued or assumed in connection with an acquisition, to divest products, services or solutions acquired in unsuccessful investments or acquisitions, to amortize costs for acquired intangible assets or because of our inability to take advantage of anticipated tax benefits;
•
increased collection times, elevated delinquency or bad debt write-offs related to receivables of an acquired business we assume;
•
difficulty in maintaining controls, procedures and policies during the transition and integration and inability to conclude that our internal controls over financial reporting are effective;
•
potential identified or unknown security vulnerabilities in acquired products that expose us to additional security risks or delay our ability to integrate the product into our offerings;
•
exposure to litigation or other claims in connection with, or inheritance of claims or litigation risk as a result of, an acquisition;
•
incurrence of additional debt to finance an acquisition, which will increase our interest expense and leverage, and/or issuance of equity securities to finance acquisitions, which will dilute current shareholders’ percentage ownership and earnings per share; and
•
failure to identify significant problems, liabilities or other challenges during due diligence.
Our ability to acquire other businesses or technologies, make strategic investments or integrate acquired businesses effectively may also be impaired by adverse economic and political events, including trade tensions, and increased global scrutiny and evolving regulatory expectations relating to acquisitions and strategic investments. We may not be able to complete acquisitions or other strategic transactions to realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions or transactions on favorable terms, or at all, including as a result of challenges in obtaining regulatory approvals, and may incur additional costs. For example, we have experienced difficulties in obtaining regulatory approvals, resulting in the termination of a previously announced acquisition and the incurrence of additional costs. Any of these factors may adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.
