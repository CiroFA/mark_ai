Management’s Discussion and Analysis
Insurance—Underwriting
GEICO
GEICO writes property and casualty policies, primarily private passenger automobile insurance, in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. GEICO markets its policies mainly by direct response methods where most customers apply for coverage directly to the company via the Internet or over the telephone. GEICO also operates an insurance agency that offers primarily homeowners and renters insurance to its auto policyholders. A summary of GEICO’s underwriting results follows (dollars in millions).
2024 versus 2023
GEICO’s pre-tax underwriting earnings increase in 2024 compared to 2023 reflected higher average premiums per auto policy, lower claims frequencies and improved operating efficiencies. These effects were partially offset by less favorable development of prior accident years’ claims estimates, increases in average claims severities and losses from catastrophe events.
Premiums written increased $3.1 billion (7.7%) in 2024 compared to 2023, reflecting an increase in average written premiums per auto policy of 7.8%, primarily attributable to rate increases, partially offset by a 0.5% decrease in policies-in-force over the past year. The rate of decline in policies-in-force slowed in the first half of 2024, with growth experienced in the second half of the year. Premiums earned in 2024 increased $3.0 billion (7.6%) compared to 2023.
Losses and loss adjustment expenses decreased $1.5 billion (4.7%) in 2024 compared to 2023. GEICO’s loss ratio (losses and loss adjustment expenses to premiums earned) was 71.8% in 2024 and 81.0% in 2023. The loss ratio decline reflected the impact of higher average earned premiums per auto policy and lower claims frequencies, partially offset by increases in average claims severities and less favorable development of prior accident years’ claims estimates.
Claims frequencies declined in 2024 versus 2023 for property damage (two to three percent range) and collision (eight to nine percent range) coverages, with bodily injury down slightly. Average claims severities increased in 2024 for property damage and collision (two to five percent range) and bodily injury coverages (eight to ten percent range) compared to 2023. Losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred in 2024 from Hurricanes Helene and Milton were approximately $360 million. Reductions in the ultimate loss estimates for prior accident years’ claims were $550 million in 2024 compared to $1.5 billion in 2023.
Underwriting expenses increased 7.7% in 2024 compared to 2023. GEICO’s expense ratio (underwriting expense to premiums earned) was 9.7% in 2024, unchanged from 2023, as improved operating efficiencies and increased operating leverage were offset by increased advertising expenses. The earnings from GEICO’s insurance agency (third-party
