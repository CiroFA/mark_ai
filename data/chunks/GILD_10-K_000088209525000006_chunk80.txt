segment disclosures in Topic 280. Beginning with this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we adopted this standard using a retrospective approach, resulting in increased disclosures in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. See Note 17. Segment Information for additional information.
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted
In November 2024, FASB issued ASU No. 2024-03 “Income Statement — Reporting Comprehensive Income — Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses.” ASU 2024-03 requires disclosure, in the notes to financial statements, of specified information about certain costs and expenses, and can be applied prospectively or retrospectively. We plan to adopt this guidance beginning with our 2027 annual report to be filed in early 2028 and all quarterly and annual reports thereafter. We expect the adoption of this standard to result in increased disclosures in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
In December 2023, FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09 “Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures.” ASU 2023-09 requires incremental annual disclosures around income tax rate reconciliations, income taxes paid and other related disclosures. This guidance requires prospective application and permits retrospective application to prior periods presented. We plan to adopt it beginning with our 2025 annual report to be filed in early 2026. We expect the adoption of this standard to result in increased disclosures in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
