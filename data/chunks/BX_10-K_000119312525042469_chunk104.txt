opportunities is within our discretion and there can be no assurance that
co-investment
opportunities of any particular type or amount will become available to any of our investors. We may take into account a variety of factors and considerations we deem relevant in allocating
co-investment
opportunities, including, without limitation, whether a potential
co-investor
has expressed an interest in evaluating
co-investment
opportunities, our assessment of a potential
co-investor’s
ability to invest an amount of capital that fits the needs of the investment and our assessment of a potential
co-investor’s
ability to commit to a
co-investment
opportunity within the required timeframe of the particular transaction.
Our fund documents typically do not mandate specific allocations with respect to
co-investments.
The investment advisers of our funds may have an incentive to provide potential
co-investment
opportunities to certain investors in lieu of others and/or in lieu of an allocation to our funds, including, for example, as part of an investor’s overall strategic relationship with us, or if such allocations are expected to generate relatively greater fees or Performance Allocations to us than would arise if such
co-investment
opportunities were allocated otherwise. At the same time, we may have an incentive to offer
co-investment
opportunities to our funds in lieu of (or to an extent that reduces the amount available to) coinvestors, particularly as we expand the number and type of private wealth products we offer.
As a general matter,
co-investors
may bear different fees and expenses than our funds. In certain instances,
co-investment
arrangements may be structured through one or more of our investment vehicles, and in such circumstances
co-investors
will generally bear the costs and expenses thereof. As a result, there may be conflicts of interest regarding the allocation of costs and expenses between
co-investors
and investors in our funds. The terms of any such existing and future
co-investment
vehicles may differ materially, and in some instances may be more favorable to us, than the terms of certain of our funds or prior
co-investment
vehicles. Such different terms may create an incentive for us to allocate a greater or lesser percentage of an investment opportunity to such
co-investment
vehicles. There can be no assurance that any conflicts of interest will be resolved in favor of any particular investment funds or investors (including any applicable
co-investors).
As with our investment allocation decisions generally, there is a risk that regulators and/or investors could challenge our allocations of
co-investment
opportunities or fees and expenses.
Valuation methodologies for certain assets in our funds can be subject to a significant degree of subjectivity and judgment, and the fair value of assets established pursuant to such methodologies may never be realized, which could result in significant losses for our funds and the reduction of
