of higher net income in 2024 offset by higher average common stockholders’ equity. Average common stockholders’ equity was higher year-over-year due to higher retained earnings as well as higher average AOCI. The increase in average AOCI was driven by lower unrealized losses on our AFS investment securities portfolio and securities transferred in 2022 from AFS to HTM (see Item 8 – Note 21).
Employing our diligent approach to managing the balance sheet, Schwab supported client-driven growth in margin and bank lending, while reducing our bank supplemental funding in 2024. Total balance sheet assets decreased 3% during the year, though margin lending grew to $83.8 billion at year-end 2024, up 34%, and bank loans increased to $45.2 billion, rising 12% during the year. Principal and interest from our AFS and HTM securities portfolios, along with deceleration of client cash realignment from sweep products to higher-yielding investment solutions, supported a reduction in bank supplemental funding, which includes brokered CDs, FHLB borrowings, and borrowings under repurchase agreements at our banks. Total bank supplemental funding ended 2024 at $49.9 billion, down $29.7 billion, or 37%, from year-end 2023, and down 49% from peak

2023 Compared to 2022
Through an uneven environment in 2023, with shifting views on the trajectory of the U.S. economy, persistent geopolitical unrest, and turmoil beginning early in the year within the banking sector, our “no trade-offs” value proposition continued to resonate with investors. The Federal Reserve raised the Federal Funds rate four times in the first three quarters of 2023 for a total of 100 basis points before holding rates unchanged from July through the end of 2023.
