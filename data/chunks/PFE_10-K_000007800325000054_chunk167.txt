Interest related to our unrecognized tax benefits is recorded in accordance with the laws of each jurisdiction and is recorded primarily in
Provision/(benefit) for taxes on income
. In 2024, we recorded a net increase in interest of $
91
million. In 2023, we recorded a net increase in interest of $
64
million. In 2022, we recorded a net decrease in interest of $
17
million. Gross accrued interest totaled $
636
million as of December 31, 2024 (reflecting a decrease of $
56
million as a result of cash payments) and gross accrued interest totaled $
605
million as of December 31, 2023 (reflecting a decrease of $
11
million as a result of cash payments). In 2024 and 2023, these amounts were substantially all included in
Other taxes payable.

Status of Tax Matters and Potential Impact on Accruals for Uncertain Tax Positions
The U.S. is one of our major tax jurisdictions, and we are regularly audited by the IRS. During the third quarter of 2024, we effectively settled the audit of Pfizer’s federal income tax returns for years 2016-2018.
Tax years 2019-2024 are open but not under audit. All other tax years are closed. In addition to the open audit years in the U.S., we have open audit years and certain related audits, appeals and investigations in certain major international tax jurisdictions such as
Canada (2017-2024), Europe (2012-2024, primarily in Ireland, the U.K., France, Italy, Spain and Germany), Asia Pacific (2014-2024, primarily in Australia, China, Japan and Singapore) and Latin America (1998-2024, primarily in Brazil).
Any settlements or statutes of limitations expirations could result in a significant decrease in our uncertain tax positions. We estimate that it is reasonably possible that within the next 12 months, our gross unrecognized tax benefits, exclusive of interest, could decrease by as much as $
200
