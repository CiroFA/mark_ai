Under certain circumstances, such as geopolitically challenging situations in regions like Russia, the Middle East and China, these various risks could become highly correlated or combine in unprecedented ways.
Any of these potential outcomes could cause JPMorganChase to suffer losses on its market-making positions or in its investment portfolio, reduce its liquidity and capital levels, increase the allowance for credit losses or lead to higher net charge-offs, hamper its ability to deliver products and services to its clients and customers, and weaken its results of operations and financial condition or credit rating.

JPMorganChase’s results of operations can be negatively affected by adverse changes in any of the following:
•
investor, consumer and business sentiment
•
events that reduce confidence in the financial markets
•
inflation, deflation or recession
•
high unemployment or, conversely, a tightening labor market
•
the availability and cost of capital, liquidity and credit
•
levels and volatility of interest rates, credit spreads and market prices for currencies, debt and equity securities and commodities, as well as the duration of any such changes
•
the economic effects of an outbreak or escalation of war, hostilities, terrorism or other geopolitical instabilities, cyber attacks, climate change, natural disasters, severe weather conditions, health emergencies, the spread of infectious diseases, epidemics or pandemics or other extraordinary events beyond JPMorganChase’s control, and

•
the inability to effectively hedge risks related to market-making and investment portfolio positions, or
•
other market risks that may not have been appropriately taken into account in the development, structuring or pricing of a financial instrument.
