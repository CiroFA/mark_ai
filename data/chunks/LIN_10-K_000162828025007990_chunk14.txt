Foreign acquisitions and joint ventures involve unique risks in addition to those mentioned herein, including those related to integration of operations across different cultures and languages, currency risks and the particular economic, political and regulatory risks associated with specific countries.
Also, the anticipated benefit of potential future acquisitions may not materialize. Future acquisitions or dispositions could result in the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities or amortization expenses, or impairments of goodwill, any of which could adversely impact Linde’s financial results.
Linde is subject to a variety of international laws and government regulations and changes in, or failure to comply with, these laws or regulations could have an adverse impact on the company’s business, financial position and results of operations.
Linde is subject to regulations in the following areas, among others:
•
environmental protection, including climate change and energy efficiency laws and policies;
•
U.S. and non-U.S. tax laws and currency controls;
•
safety;
•
securities laws applicable in the United States, the European Union, and other jurisdictions;
•
trade and import/export restrictions, as well as economic sanctions laws;
•
antitrust matters;
•
data protection;
•
global anti-bribery laws, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act; and
•
healthcare regulations.
