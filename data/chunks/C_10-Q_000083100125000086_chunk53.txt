MARKET RISK OF TRADING PORTFOLIOS
Value at Risk (VaR)
Citi believes its VaR model is conservatively calibrated to incorporate fat-tail scaling and the greater of short-term (approximately the most recent month) and long-term (18 months for commodities and three years for others) market volatility. As of March 31, 2025, Citi estimates that the conservative features of the VaR calibration contribute an approximate 17% add-on to what would be a VaR estimated under the assumption of stable and perfectly, normally distributed markets. As of December 31, 2024, the add-on was 24%.
As presented in the table below, Citi’s average trading VaR for the first quarter of 2025 remained unchanged from the fourth quarter of 2024 despite VaR changes within asset classes from inventory changes and volatility updates.
Quarter-end and Average Trading VaR and Trading and Credit Portfolio VaR
(1)    Covariance adjustment (also known as diversification benefit) equals the difference between the total VaR and the sum of the VaRs tied to each risk type.
