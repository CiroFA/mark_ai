Overview
PMI operates globally with manufacturing and sales facilities in various locations around the world and is exposed to risks such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. As a result, PMI uses deliverable and non-deliverable forward foreign exchange contracts, foreign currency swaps and foreign currency options, (collectively referred to as "foreign exchange contracts"), and interest rate contracts to mitigate its exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange and interest rates related to net investments in foreign operations, third-party and intercompany actual and forecasted transactions. The primary currencies to which PMI is exposed include the Euro, Egyptian pound, Indonesian rupiah, Japanese yen, Mexican peso, Philippine peso, Polish zloty, Russian ruble and Swiss franc.
