debt, excluding post-closing adjustments.
Under the acquisition method, the purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair value. NEE acquired identifiable assets of approximately $
1.3
billion, primarily relating to property, plant and equipment and intangible assets associated with biogas rights agreements and above-market purchased power agreements, and assumed liabilities of approximately $
0.3
billion and noncontrolling interests of approximately $
0.1
billion. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed resulted in approximately $
0.3
billion of goodwill which has been recognized on NEE's consolidated balance sheets, of which approximately $
0.2
billion is expected to be deductible for tax purposes. Goodwill associated with the RNG acquisition is reflected within NEER and, for impairment testing, is included in the clean energy assets reporting unit. The goodwill arising from the transaction represents expected benefits of synergies and expansion opportunities for NEE's clean energy businesses.
