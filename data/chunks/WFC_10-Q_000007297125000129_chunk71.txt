We manage our credit risk by establishing what we believe are sound credit policies for underwriting new business, while monitoring and reviewing the performance of our existing loan portfolios. We employ various credit risk management and monitoring activities to mitigate risks associated with multiple risk factors affecting loans we hold including:
•
Loan concentrations and related credit quality;
•
Counterparty credit risk;
•
Economic and market conditions;
•
Legislative or regulatory mandates;
•
Changes in interest rates;
•
Merger and acquisition activities; and
•
Reputation risk.
Our credit risk management oversight process is governed centrally, but provides for direct management and accountability by our lines of business. Our overall credit process includes comprehensive credit policies, disciplined credit underwriting, frequent and detailed risk measurement and modeling, extensive credit training programs, and a continual loan review and audit process.
A key to our credit risk management is adherence to a well-controlled underwriting process, which we believe is appropriate for the needs of our customers as well as investors who purchase the loans or securities collateralized by the loans.

COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL LOANS AND LEASE FINANCING.

Our ratings are aligned to regulatory definitions of pass and criticized categories with criticized segmented among special mention, substandard, doubtful, and loss categories.
