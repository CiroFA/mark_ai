States. The FDA’s decision followed its comprehensive assessment of our PMTA. On December 7, 2020, the FDA reached the same determination for the
IQOS
3 device and authorized that version of
IQOS
for sale in the United States.
On July 7, 2020, the FDA determined that the available scientific evidence demonstrates that the issuance of an exposure modification order would be appropriate for the promotion of public health and authorized the marketing of a version of
IQOS
, namely
IQOS
2.4 and three related consumables, as an MRTP with reduced exposure claims. On March 11, 2022, the FDA reached the same determination for the
IQOS
3 device. The FDA authorized the marketing of this product in the U.S. with the following information:
"AVAILABLE EVIDENCE TO DATE:
•
the
IQOS
system heats tobacco but does not burn it.
•
this significantly reduces the production of harmful and potentially harmful chemicals.
•
scientific studies have shown that switching completely from conventional cigarettes to the
IQOS
system significantly reduces your body’s exposure to harmful or potentially harmful chemicals."

The FDA may issue two types of MRTP orders: a “risk modification” order or an “exposure modification” order. We had requested both types of orders for
IQOS
2.4 and an initial selection of three related consumables' variants.  After review, the FDA determined that the evidence did not support issuing a "risk modification" order at that time, but that it did support issuing an "exposure modification" order for the product. This determination included a finding that issuance of the exposure modification order is expected to benefit the health of the population as a whole. We also received an exposure modification order for
IQOS
3 in March 2022. We look forward to working with the FDA to provide any additional information they may require to market SFPs with reduced risk claims.
The FDA’s PMTA and MRTP orders do not mean that the agency “approved”
IQOS
.  These authorizations are subject to strict marketing, reporting, and other requirements, and are not a guarantee that the product will remain authorized, particularly if there is a significant uptake in youth or non-smoker initiation.  The FDA will monitor the marketing of the product.
On January 26, 2023, the FDA authorized the marketing of two new tobacco-flavored consumables (
Marlboro
Sienna
HeatSticks
and
Marlboro
Bronze
HeatSticks
) and a modified version of the authorized
Marlboro
Amber
HeatSticks
. These products are line extensions and/or modified versions of the tobacco-flavored consumables for which the FDA had previously issued a marketing granted order. In its assessment, the FDA determined that the three variants of
HeatSticks
were comparable to the previously authorized tobacco-flavored consumables.
On July 5, 2023, we submitted renewal applications to the FDA requesting re-authorization to continue to market those
IQOS
products that previously received an exposure modification order with a
