margins could be materially adversely affected.
As a greater percentage of our transactions involve us processing payments, our global systems and processes must be managed on a larger scale, which adds complexity, administrative burdens and costs, and increases the demands on our systems and controls, which could adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, as our payment processing activities develop or expand into different geographies, we expect to be subject to additional regulations, including financial services and export controls regulations, which we expect to result in increased compliance costs and complexities, including those associated with the implementation of new or advanced internal controls. Compliance with and implementation of the EU's Payment Services Directive 2 and similar or successor legislation such as the EU's Payment Services Directive 3 and Payment Services Regulations may be difficult to adhere to in a timely manner, result in increased compliance costs, and be administratively burdensome, any of which could negatively impact our business and results of operations.
Regulators (or we) may determine, and in some cases are likely to determine, that certain aspects of our business are subject to laws that govern payments activities, such as money transmission and online payments processing, which could require us to obtain licenses to continue to operate in certain jurisdictions or result in modification or interruption of our business plans, which would negatively impact our business and results of operations. Certain of our subsidiaries that may provide payment services in support of our brands are subject to licensing and regulations that impose notice and approval obligations on investors that seek indirect or direct ownership, in the aggregate, of 10% or more of our outstanding shares. Regulations relating to operational resilience, including the EU's Digital Operations Resilience Act, banking (including consumer protection), privacy, and security of our processes also apply to us. Further, our payments systems are susceptible to illegal and improper uses, including money laundering, terrorist financing, fraudulent sales of goods or services, and transactions by or with sanctioned parties. We have invested and will need to continue to invest substantial resources to comply with applicable laws and regulations, and failure to maintain compliance with applicable licensing, payment services, customer fund safeguarding, or related regulations could lead to fines, which could be significant, or require us to modify or interrupt our business practices, plans, or operations, any of which could negatively impact our business, results of operations, and profit margins.
We are also subject to payment card association rules and obligations under our contracts with the card schemes and our payment card processors, and indirectly to the rules of payment systems in respect of credit (i.e., account to account)
