required to file an IRS Form 8886 (including a protective filing) in connection with the potential issuance of fast-pay stock with respect to our previously issued series A perpetual strike preferred stock or Additional Shares, we intend to provide public notice to the holders of our series A perpetual strike preferred stock or Additional Shares, as applicable, which notice may be by a press release, by publication on our investor relations website, or by filing a current report on Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Notwithstanding our intent not to issue Additional Shares that would be fast-pay stock, the rules regarding the definition of fast-pay stock are unclear in certain respects and, therefore, the IRS could disagree with our determination and treat such Additional Shares as fast-pay stock. In addition, even though we believe that our series A perpetual strike preferred stock is not fast-pay stock, treatment of the Additional Shares as fast-pay stock could result in adverse consequences to holders of our series A perpetual strike preferred stock because such Additional Shares may be indistinguishable from our previously issued our series A perpetual strike preferred stock.
Accordingly, holders of series A perpetual strike preferred stock are strongly urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the Fast-Pay Stock Regulations and their potential consequences to an investment in our series A perpetual strike preferred stock.
A future issuance of Additional Shares could have an adverse tax profile, which could subject holders of our previously issued series A perpetual strike preferred stock to adverse consequences
If we issue Additional Shares that have a different, and potentially adverse, tax profile or treatment for U.S. federal income tax purposes from our series A perpetual strike preferred stock, since such Additional Shares would trade under the same CUSIP or other identifying number as that of our series A perpetual strike preferred stock, our series A perpetual strike preferred stock may be treated by subsequent purchasers, withholding agents and potentially the IRS as having the same profile or treatment as such Additional Shares if our previously issued series A perpetual strike preferred stock is not otherwise distinguishable from the Additional Shares.
For example, notwithstanding our intent not to issue any Additional Shares that are fast-pay stock, the IRS could assert that such Additional Shares constitute fast-pay stock, particularly if they are issued at a premium to their liquidation preference.
Furthermore, if any Additional Shares are issued at a price that exceeds their liquidation preference, such Additional Shares would constitute “disqualified preferred stock” within the meaning of Section 1059(f)(2) of the Code and any corporate U.S. holder generally will be required to reduce its tax basis (but not below zero) in our series A perpetual strike preferred stock by the amount of any dividends-
