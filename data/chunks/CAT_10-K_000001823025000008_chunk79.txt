OVERVIEW
Total sales and revenues for 2024 were $64.809 billion, a decrease of $2.251 billion, or 3 percent, compared with $67.060 billion for 2023. The decrease reflected lower
sales volume
, partially offset by favorable
price realization
. Lower sales volume was primarily driven by lower sales of equipment to end users.
Profit per share was $22.05 in 2024, compared with profit per share of $20.12 in 2023. Profit was $10.792 billion in 2024, compared with $10.335 billion in 2023. The profit impact of lower sales volume was more than offset by favorable price realization and the absence of the impact of the divestiture of the company's Longwall business in 2023.
Trends and Economic Conditions
Outlook for Key End Markets
Our results continue to reflect the benefit of the diversity of our end markets.
In Construction Industries, we expect moderately lower sales of equipment to end users in North America in 2025 compared to 2024. Construction spend in North America remains healthy, primarily driven by large, multi-year projects and government-related infrastructure investments supported by funding from the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA). Although we anticipate the combined non-residential and residential construction spend in 2025 to remain similar to 2024 levels, our current planning assumptions reflect lower demand for new equipment in 2025 as compared to 2024. We also expect lower dealer rental fleet loading in 2025 compared to 2024, although dealer rental revenue is expected to grow. We remain positive about the medium- and long-term outlook in North America. In Asia Pacific, outside of China, we expect soft economic conditions to

, we anticipate that weak economic conditions in Europe will continue, and we anticipate a healthy level of construction activity in Africa and in the Middle East in 2025. Construction activity in

is expected to moderately decline in 2025 as compared to 2024. We also anticipate the ongoing benefit
