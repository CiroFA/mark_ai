carryforwards of approximately $
335
million. The California research and experimentation credit will carry forward indefinitely.
The aggregate changes in the balance of our gross unrecognized tax benefits were as follows for the periods indicated:
The total amount of our unrecognized tax benefits at July 31, 2024 was $
327
million. If we were to recognize these net benefits, our income tax expense would reflect a favorable net impact of $
210
million. We do not believe that it is reasonably possible that there will be a significant increase or decrease in unrecognized tax benefits over the next 12 months.
We file U.S. federal, U.S. state, and foreign tax returns. Our major tax jurisdiction is the U.S. federal jurisdiction. For U.S. federal tax returns, we are no longer subject to tax examinations for years prior to fiscal 2021 except for fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2016.
We recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for income taxes. Amounts accrued at July 31, 2024 and July 31, 2023 for the payment of interest and penalties were not material. The amounts of interest and penalties that we recognized during the twelve months ended July 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, were also not material.
We offset a $
66
million and $
85
million long-term liability for uncertain tax positions against our long-term income tax receivable at July 31, 2024 and July 31, 2023, respectively. The long-term income tax receivable at July 31, 2024 was primarily related to the government’s approval of a method of accounting change request for fiscal 2018. The long-term income tax receivable at July 31, 2023 was primarily related to the government’s approval of a method of accounting change request for fiscal 2018 and a refund claim related to Credit Karma’s alternative minimum tax credit that was recorded as part of the acquisition.

Intuit’s Board of Directors has authorized a series of common stock repurchase programs. Shares of common stock repurchased under these programs become treasury shares. Under these programs, we repurchased
3.4
million shares of our common stock for $
2.0
billion during the twelve months ended July 31, 2024. At July 31, 2024, we had authorization from our Board of Directors for up to $
1.9
billion in stock repurchases. On August 20, 2024, our Board of Directors approved an increase in the authorization under the existing stock repurchase program under which we are authorized to repurchase up to an additional $
3
billion of our common stock. Future stock repurchases under the current program are at the discretion of management, and authorization of future stock repurchase programs is subject to the final determination of our Board of Directors.
Our treasury shares are repurchased at the market price on the trade date; accordingly, all amounts paid to reacquire these shares have been recorded as treasury stock on our consolidated balance sheets. Any direct costs to acquire treasury stock are
