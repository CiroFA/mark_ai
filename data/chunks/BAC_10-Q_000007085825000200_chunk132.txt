The table below presents the fair value and the associated gross unrealized losses on AFS debt securities and whether these securities have had gross unrealized losses for less than 12 months or for 12 months or longer at March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024.
The remaining contractual maturity distribution and yields of the Corporation’s debt securities carried at fair value and HTM debt securities at March 31, 2025 are summarized in the table below. Actual duration and yields may differ as prepayments on the loans underlying the mortgage-backed securities (MBS) or other asset-backed securities (ABS) are passed through to the Corporation.

The weighted-average yield is computed based on a constant effective yield over the contractual life of each security. The yield considers the contractual coupon and the amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts, excluding the effect of related open hedging derivatives.
