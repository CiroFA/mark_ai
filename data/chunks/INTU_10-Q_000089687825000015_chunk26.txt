includes the exit of employees and the closing of real estate sites in certain markets in service to growing technology teams and capabilities in strategic locations. The actions associated with the Plan were substantially complete in the first quarter of fiscal 2025. Total restructuring costs associated with the Plan are estimated to be approximately $236 million. During the six months ended January 31, 2025, we recorded a $13 million charge in connection with the Plan. This charge is primarily related to severance, employee benefits, and site closure costs and is recorded to restructuring in our condensed consolidated statements of operations.

On August 1, 2024, we renamed our Small Business & Self-Employed segment as the Global Business Solutions segment. This new name better aligns with the global reach of the Mailchimp and QuickBooks platform, our focus on serving both small and mid-market businesses, and our vision to become the end-to-end platform that customers use to grow and run their business.
On August 1, 2024, we reorganized certain technology and customer success functions in our Global Business Solutions, Consumer, and ProTax segments that support and benefit our overall platform and are managed at that level rather than at the segment level. As a result of these reorganizations, costs associated with these functions are no longer included in segment operating income and are now included in other corporate expenses. For the
three and six
months ended January 31, 2024, we reclassified expenses totaling
$350 million and $682 million
from Global Business Solutions
, $129 million and $194 million from Consumer, and $8 million and $16 million from ProTax to other corporate expenses, respectively, to conform to the current presentation.
