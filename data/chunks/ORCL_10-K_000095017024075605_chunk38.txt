U.S. federal, state, or foreign laws and regulations, including laws and regulations regulating privacy, data security, or consumer protection, public perception, standards, self-regulatory requirements or legal obligations, could result in lost or restricted business, proceedings, actions or fines brought against us or levied by governmental entities or others, or could adversely affect our business and harm our reputation.
Third parties have claimed, and in the future may claim, infringement or misuse of intellectual property rights and/or breach of license agreement provisions.
We periodically receive notices from, or have lawsuits filed against us by, third parties claiming infringement or other misuse of their intellectual property rights and/or breach of our agreements with them. These third parties include entities that do not design, manufacture, or distribute products or services or that acquire intellectual property for the sole purpose of monetization through infringement assertions. We expect to continue to receive such claims as:
•
we continue to expand into new businesses and acquire companies;
•
the number of products and competitors in our industry segments grows;
•
the use and support of third-party code (including open source code) becomes more prevalent in the industry;
•
the volume of issued patents continues to increase; and
•
non-practicing entities continue to assert intellectual property infringement in our industry segments.
Responding to any such claim, regardless of its validity, could:
•
be time consuming, costly and result in litigation;
•
divert management’s time and attention from developing our business;
•
require us to pay monetary damages or enter into royalty and licensing agreements that we would not normally find acceptable;
•
require us to stop selling or to redesign certain of our products;
•
require us to release source code to third parties, possibly under open source license terms;
•
require us to satisfy indemnification obligations to our customers; or
•
otherwise adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.
We may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights.
We rely on copyright, trademark, patent and trade secret laws, confidentiality procedures, controls and contractual commitments to protect our intellectual property. Despite our efforts, these protections may be limited. Unauthorized third parties may try to copy or reverse engineer our products or otherwise use our intellectual property. Our patents may be invalidated or circumvented. Any of our pending or future patent applications may not be issued with the claim scope we seek, if at all. In addition, the laws of some countries do not provide the same level of intellectual property protection as U.S. laws and courts. If we cannot protect our intellectual property against unauthorized copying or use, or other misappropriation, we may not remain competitive.
