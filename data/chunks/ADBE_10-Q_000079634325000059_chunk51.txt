The occurrence of an epidemic or a pandemic, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, has had, and may in the future have, an adverse effect on our operating results. The extent to which epidemics and pandemics impact our financial condition or results of operations will depend on many factors outside of our control and whether there is a material impact on the businesses or productivity of our customers, employees, suppliers and other partners. A global pandemic may also intensify the other risks described in this Part II, Item 1A of this report.
Our stock price may be volatile and your investment could lose value.
Our stock price has been and may continue to be volatile and subject to fluctuations. All factors described in this Part II, Item 1A of this report, some of which are beyond our control, may affect our stock price, including:
•
shortfalls in our results or shortfalls, changes to estimates, recommendations or expectations in guidance we provide or provided by financial analysts about our revenue, margins, earnings, annualized recurring revenue, growth rates or other key performance metrics;
•
changes to our key performance metrics;
•
changes in investor and analyst valuation models for our stock;
•
changes in unearned revenue, remaining performance obligations and revenue recognized at a point in time, all of which may impact implied growth rates;
•
developments related to products or services, technological advancements, strategic alliances, acquisitions or significant transactions by us or our competitors;
•
changes in the amounts or frequency of stock repurchases;
•
the loss of large customers or our inability to retain or increase sales to existing customers or attract new customers;

other events, such as significant litigation and regulatory actions and media and social media scrutiny.
In addition, the market for technology stocks or the stock market in general has experienced, and may in the future experience, extreme fluctuations, which has caused, and may in the future cause, our stock price to decline for reasons unrelated to our financial performance. Volatility in our stock price has increased, and may continue to increase, our susceptibility to securities class action litigation, which could result in substantial costs and divert management’s attention and resources, which may adversely affect our business.
