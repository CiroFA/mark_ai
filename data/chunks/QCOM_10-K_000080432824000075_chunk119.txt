unused federal net operating loss carryforwards of $
150
million, of which $
102
million expire from 2025 through 2037 and $
48
million may be carried forward indefinitely. At September 29, 2024, we had unused state tax credits of $
1.9
billion, of which substantially all may be carried forward indefinitely, unused federal tax credits of $
219
million expiring from 2028 through 2041 and unused tax credits of $
92
million in foreign jurisdictions expiring from 2031 through 2044. We do not expect our federal net operating loss carryforwards to expire unused.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
At September 29, 2024, we have provided a valuation allowance on certain state tax credits, foreign deferred tax assets and state net operating losses of $
1.9
billion, $
121
million and $
41
million respectively. The valuation allowance reflects the uncertainties surrounding our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions to utilize our net deferred tax assets. We believe, more likely than not, that we will have sufficient taxable income to utilize our remaining deferred tax assets.
A summary of the changes in the amount of unrecognized tax benefits for fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022 follows (in millions):
Of the $
2.5
billion of unrecognized tax benefits, $
2.3
billion has been recorded to other liabilities. We believe that it is reasonably possible that certain unrecognized tax benefits recorded at September 29, 2024 may result in a cash payment in fiscal 2025. Unrecognized tax benefits at September 29, 2024 included $
91
million for tax positions that, if recognized, would impact the effective tax rate. The unrecognized tax benefits differ from the amount that would affect our effective tax rate primarily because the unrecognized tax benefits were included on a gross basis and did not reflect related receivables or secondary impacts, such as the federal deduction for state taxes, adjustments to deferred tax assets and the valuation allowance that might be required if our tax positions are sustained. The increase in unrecognized tax benefits for all periods presented was primarily due to expected refunds of Korean withholding tax previously paid (which such increase had an insignificant impact to our income tax provision). If successful, the refund will result in a corresponding reduction in U.S. foreign tax credits. We believe that it is likely that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits at September 29, 2024 will increase in fiscal 2025 as licensees in Korea continue to withhold taxes on future payments due under their licensing agreements at a rate higher than we believe is owed; such increase is not expected to have a significant impact on our income tax provision. At September 29, 2024, total interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits accrued in other current liabilities and other liabilities was $
250
million, with a corresponding noncurrent income taxes
