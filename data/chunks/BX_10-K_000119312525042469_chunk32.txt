“Fee-Earning
Assets Under Management” refers to the portion of Total Assets Under Management on which we are entitled to earn management fees and/or performance revenues. The
Fee-Earning
Assets Under Management attributable to an individual vehicle is driven by the basis on which fees are earned and accordingly, will vary from vehicle to vehicle.
Fee-Earning
Assets Under Management generally equals the sum of the following across Blackstone-managed or advised vehicles, as applicable: (a) net asset value, (b) committed capital and remaining invested capital during the investment period and post-investment period, respectively, (c) invested capital (including leverage to the extent management
fee-eligible),
(d) gross asset value, (e) fair value of investments, or (f) the aggregate par amount of collateral assets, including principal cash, of CLOs.
Assets may be raised in one vehicle or business unit and subsequently invested in or managed or advised by another vehicle or business unit.

Fee-Earning
Assets Under Management may differ from the definition set forth in the agreements governing the vehicles that we manage or advise.

Perpetual Capital includes
co-investment
capital with an investor right to convert into Perpetual Capital.
Commitment-based drawdown structured funds generally do not permit investors to redeem their interests at their election. Certain of our open-ended vehicles generally afford an investor the right to withdraw or redeem their interests on a periodic basis (for example, annually, quarterly or monthly), typically with 2 to 95 days’ notice, depending on the fund and the liquidity profile of the underlying assets. In our perpetual capital vehicles where redemption rights exist, redemption requests are required to be fulfilled only (a) in Blackstone’s or the vehicles’ board’s discretion, as applicable, (b) to the extent there is sufficient new capital, or (c) where such
