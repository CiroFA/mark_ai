Revenue Service (IRS). We partner with third-party issuing banks to originate the loans and subsequently purchase full participating interests in those loans. The refund advance loans are not secured and are recorded at amortized cost, net of an allowance for credit losses. As of January 31, 2025 and July 31, 2024, the net notes receivable balances for refund advance loans were $
268
million and $
4
million, respectively. As of January 31, 2025, we had commitments to purchase $
30
million in refund advance loans that were originated on or prior to January 31, 2025. We maintain an allowance for credit losses to reserve for potentially uncollectible loans. We estimate the allowance based on expected funding of refunds by the IRS using historical trends. When we determine that any amounts are uncollectible, we charge them off against the allowance. As of January 31, 2025 and July 31, 2024, the allowances for credit losses on refund advance loans were not material.
Term loans to small businesses.
We have entered into two forward flow arrangements that facilitate the sale of participation interests in unsecured term loans to small businesses.
In August 2023, we entered into a forward flow arrangement with an institutional investor (2023 Forward Flow Agreement), which has since been amended, most recently in January 2025. Pursuant to the amended 2023 Forward Flow Agreement, we have a commitment to sell to the institutional investor a minimum of approximately $
8
million monthly and $
350
million cumulatively in participation interests in unsecured term loans to small businesses over
four years
, subject to certain eligibility criteria. As of January 31, 2025, we have met the cumulative commitment to sell term loans under this arrangement, and the remaining monthly commitments total $
225
million through July 31, 2027.
In January 2025, we entered into a forward flow arrangement with an institutional investor (2025 Forward Flow Agreement) that terminates on July 23, 2029. Pursuant to the 2025 Forward Flow Agreement, we have a commitment to sell to the institutional investor a minimum of $
300
million in participation interests in unsecured term loans to small businesses over the first
18
months of the arrangement, subject to certain eligibility criteria. The 2025 Forward Flow Agreement also includes monthly commitments that vary based on certain conditions, up to a maximum of $
45
million. As of January 31, 2025, the remaining cumulative commitment totals $
300
million.
Notes receivable held for sale are recorded at the lower of amortized cost or fair value determined on an individual loan basis. We recognize a gain or loss on sale of loans sold to third parties by calculating the difference between the proceeds received and the carrying value of the loans sold. As of January 31, 2025 and July 31, 2024, the balances of notes receivable held for sale were $
