Table 13.2:
Residential MSRs – Assumptions at Securitization Date
(1)
Includes a blend of prepayment speeds and expected defaults. Prepayment speeds are influenced by mortgage interest rates as well as our estimation of drivers of borrower behavior.
See Note 12 (Fair Value Measurements) and Note 6 (Mortgage Banking Activities) for additional information on key assumptions for residential MSRs.
RESECURITIZATION ACTIVITIES.
We enter into resecuritization transactions as part of our trading activities to accommodate the investment and risk management activities of our customers. In resecuritization transactions, we transfer trading debt securities to VIEs in exchange for new beneficial interests that are sold to third parties at or shortly after securitization settlement. This activity is performed for customers seeking a specific return or risk profile. Substantially all of our transactions involve the resecuritization of conforming mortgage-backed securities issued by the GSEs or guaranteed by GNMA. We do not consolidate the resecuritization VIEs as we share in the decision-making power with third parties and do not hold significant economic interests in the VIEs other than for market-making activities. During the quarters ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, we transferred trading debt securities of $
4.9
billion and $
2.7
billion, respectively, to resecuritization VIEs, and retained trading debt securities of $
575
million and $
229
million, respectively. These amounts are not included in Table 13.1. As of March 31, 2025, and December 31, 2024, we held $
1.1
billion and $
819
million of trading debt securities, respectively. Total resecuritization VIE assets, to which we sold assets and hold an interest, were $
49.8
billion and $
44.1
billion at March 31, 2025, and December 31, 2024, respectively.
Sold or Securitized Loans Serviced for Others
Table 13.3 presents information about loans that we have originated and sold or securitized in which we have ongoing involvement as servicer. For loans sold or securitized where servicing is our only form of continuing involvement, we generally experience a loss only if we were required to repurchase a delinquent loan or foreclosed asset due to a breach in representations and warranties associated with our loan sale or servicing contracts. Delinquent loans include loans 90 days or more past due and loans in bankruptcy, regardless of delinquency status.
Table 13.3 excludes mortgage loans sold to and held or securitized by GSEs or GNMA of $
527.7
billion and $
528.1
billion at March 31, 2025, and December 31, 2024, respectively, due to guarantees provided by GSEs and the FHA and VA, which limit our credit risk associated with such securitizations. Delinquent loans and foreclosed assets related to loans sold to and held or securitized by GSEs and GNMA were $
2.2
billion and $
2.4
billion at March 31, 2025, and December 31, 2024, respectively.
