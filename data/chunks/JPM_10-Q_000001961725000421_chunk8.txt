credit losses was $973 million.
Net charge-offs included $2.1 billion in
consumer
, predominantly driven by Card Services, reflecting the seasoning of vintages originated in recent years, and $187 million in
wholesale
.
The net addition to the allowance for credit losses was largely driven by changes in the weighted-average macroeconomic outlook, and consisted of:
•
$549 million in
wholesale
, which also reflected changes in credit quality on client-specific exposures and the impact of new lending-related commitments, and
•
$441 million in
consumer
, predominantly driven by Card Services.
In the prior year, the provision was $1.9 billion, net charge-offs were $2.0 billion and the net reduction in the allowance for credit losses was $72 million.

Includes depreciation expense associated with auto operating lease assets. Refer to Note 16 for additional information.
(b)
Refer to Note 5 for additional information.
Quarterly results
Compensation expense
increased driven by:
•
higher revenue-related compensation, particularly in CIB and AWM, and
•
growth in the number of employees across the LOBs and Corporate, primarily in front office and technology.
Noncompensation expense
decreased as a result of:
•
lower FDIC-related expense, which included the impact of an FDIC special assessment accrual release of $323 million in Corporate, compared with an accrual increase of $725 million in the prior year, and
•
the absence of restructuring and integration costs associated with First Republic recorded in the prior year,
offset by
•
higher legal expense, particularly in CIB, largely due to the absence of a legal benefit from the prior year,
•
higher brokerage expense in CIB and higher distribution fees in AWM,
•
higher investments in marketing, predominantly in CCB, as well as in technology across the Firm; and to a lesser extent,
•
higher occupancy expense, higher operating losses, largely in CCB, and higher depreciation expense on higher auto lease assets.
Refer to Note 5 for additional information on other expense.
Quarterly results
The
effective tax rate
decreased predominantly driven by higher benefits related to the vesting of employee share-based awards in the current period as a result of the Firm’s higher share price, and changes in the mix of income and expenses subject to U.S. federal, state and local taxes.
