We are impacted by evolving laws, regulations and legislative or regulatory actions applicable to the healthcare industry.
The healthcare industry is subject to various federal, state and international laws and regulations pertaining to drug approval, manufacturing, reimbursement, rebates, price reporting, healthcare fraud and abuse, and data privacy and security. In the U.S., these laws include anti-kickback and false claims laws, the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, laws and regulations relating to the Medicare and Medicaid programs and other federal and state programs, such as the Medicaid Rebate Statute and the 340B statute, laws that regulate written and verbal communications about our products, individual state laws relating to pricing and sales and marketing practices, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act and other federal and state laws relating to the privacy and security of health information, including the Executive Order on Preventing Access to Americansâ€™ Bulk Sensitive Personal Data, which may impact how and where clinical and other sensitive data is shared, accessed and analyzed, and United States Government-Related Data by Countries of Concern issued in February 2024.
