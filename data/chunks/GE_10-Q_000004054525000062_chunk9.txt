ended March 31, 2025 and 2024. The change in the tax provision was primarily due to the tax effect of the increase in adjusted net income before taxes* and an increase in global minimum tax (Pillar 2), partially offset by favorable audit resolutions for the three months ended March 31, 2025 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2024.

CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY
FINANCIAL POLICY
. GE Aerospace is committed to maintaining strong investment grade ratings with a disciplined capital allocation strategy. The Company will continue to invest in future growth and innovation through research and development and capital expenditures. We intend to return a majority of our free cash flow* to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Merger and acquisition investments will be pursued in a disciplined way and focused on those that offer strategic, operational and financial synergies.
LIQUIDITY POLICY.
We maintain a strong focus on liquidity and define our liquidity risk tolerance based on sources and uses to maintain a sufficient liquidity position to meet our business needs and financial obligations under both normal and stressed conditions. We believe that our consolidated liquidity and availability under our revolving credit facilities will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs.
CONSOLIDATED LIQUIDITY.
Our primary sources of liquidity consist of cash and cash equivalents, free cash flow* from our operating businesses, and access to capital markets. If needed, we can also draw from short-term borrowing facilities, including revolving credit facilities. Cash generation can be subject to variability based on many factors, including receipt of down payments on large equipment orders, timing of billings on long-term contracts, timing of customer allowances and market conditions. Total cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash was $12.4 billion at March 31, 2025, of which $4.3 billion was held in the U.S. and $8.1 billion was held outside the U.S.
Cash held outside the U.S. has generally been reinvested in active foreign business operations; however, substantially all of our unrepatriated income was subject to U.S. federal tax and, if there is a change in reinvestment, we would expect to be able to repatriate available cash (excluding amounts held in countries with currency controls) without significant tax cost.
Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash at March 31, 2025 included $0.4
