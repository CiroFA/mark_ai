274 million
common shares that
were issued upon Spin-Off and excludes Net loss (income) attributable to noncontrolling interests. For periods prior to the Spin-Off, the
Company participated in various GE stock-based compensation plans, and there were no dilutive equity instruments as there were no
equity awards of GE Vernova outstanding prior to Spin-Off.

increased productivity partially offset by the impact of inflation and additional expenses to support investments at Gas Power and Nuclear
Power
; at Electrification of
$0.1 billion
, primarily due to volume, productivity, and favorable
price
at Grid Solutions; and at
Wind of less than
$0.1 billion
, primarily at Onshore Wind
due to improved equipment pricing,
market select
ivity, and increases in units delivered at
Onshore

Wind due to a
termination
of a supply agreement; partially offset by higher corporate costs required to operate as a stand-alone public
company
