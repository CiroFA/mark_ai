devaluation of the Argentine peso contributed approximately 2 percentage points of the negative impact of foreign exchange, which was largely offset by inflation-related price increases consistent with practice in that market.
Sales of livestock products grew 4% in 2024 primarily due to higher pricing, increased demand for poultry and swine products, as well as the inclusion of sales from the July 2024 acquisition of the aqua business of Elanco Animal Health Incorporated (Elanco aqua business).

Cost of Sales
Cost of sales was $15.2 billion in 2024 and $16.1 billion in 2023. Cost of sales includes the amortization of intangible assets recorded in connection with acquisitions, collaborations, and licensing arrangements, which totaled $2.4 billion in 2024 and $2.0 billion in 2023. Amortization expense in 2024 and 2023 includes $48 million and $154 million, respectively, of cumulative catch-up amortization related to Merck’s collaborations with AstraZeneca and Eisai, respectively. (See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for more information on Merck’s collaborative arrangements). Also included in cost of sales are expenses associated with restructuring activities, which amounted to $495 million in 2024 and $211 million in 2023, primarily reflecting accelerated depreciation and asset impairment charges related to the planned sale or closure of manufacturing facilities. Separation costs associated with manufacturing-related headcount reductions have been incurred and are reflected in
Restructuring costs
as discussed below.
Gross margin was 76.3% in 2024 compared with 73.2% in 2023. The gross margin improvement was primarily due to the favorable effects of product mix (including lower royalty rates related to
Keytruda
and
Gardasil/Gardasil

sales) and foreign exchange, partially offset by increased amortization of intangible assets, higher restructuring costs (primarily reflecting asset impairment charges), and increased manufacturing-related costs (including inventory write-offs).
Selling, General and Administrative
Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses were $10.8 billion in 2024, an increase of 3% compared with 2023. The increase was primarily due to higher administrative costs (including compensation and benefits), and increased promotional costs (reflecting prioritization in support of key growth drivers including new product launches), as well as higher selling and acquisition-related costs, partially offset by the favorable effect of foreign exchange and lower restructuring costs.
