Three Months Ended March 31, 2025 Compared with Three Months Ended March 31, 2024
Revenue increased $548 million, or 12%, from the three months ended March 31, 2024, primarily driven by organic base fee growth, the impact of market beta on average AUM, fees related to the GIP Transaction and higher technology services and subscription revenue, including the partial impact of the Preqin Transaction, which closed on March 3, 2025, partially offset by lower performance fees.
Investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue
of $4.4 billion increased $623 million from $3.8 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2024, primarily driven by organic base fee growth, the impact of market beta on average AUM and approximately $285 million of fees related to the GIP Transaction, partially offset by the effect of one fewer day in the current quarter. Securities lending revenue of $157 million increased from $151 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024.
Investment advisory performance fees
of $60 million decreased $144 million from $204 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, primarily reflecting lower revenue from private markets and liquid alternative products.
Technology services and subscription revenue
of $436 million increased $59 million from $377 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, reflecting the sustained demand for Aladdin technology offerings and the partial impact from the Preqin Transaction, which added approximately $20 million to first quarter revenue.
