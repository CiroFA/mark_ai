Legacy Franchises (Managed Basis)
Legacy Franchises (managed basis) includes:
•
Mexico Consumer/SBMM;
•
Asia Consumer Banking (Asia Consumer), representing the consumer banking operations of the remaining three exit countries (Korea, Poland and Russia); and
•
Legacy Holdings Assets, primarily $2.0 billion of legacy consumer mortgage loans in North America, as well as the U.K. retail banking business, both of which Citi continues to wind down.
Since announcing its intention to exit consumer banking across 14 markets in Asia, Europe, the Middle East and Mexico as part of its strategic refresh, Citi has now closed sales in nine of those markets, has a sale process underway in Poland and has continued to make progress on its wind-downs in Korea and Russia. The previously announced wind-down of Citi’s consumer business in China is substantially complete. See Note 2 for additional information on Legacy Franchises’ consumer banking business sales and wind-downs. For additional information about Citi’s continued efforts to reduce its operations and exposures in Russia, see “Risk Factors” and “Managing Global Risk—Other Risks—Country Risk—Russia” below.
Mexico Consumer/SBMM operates primarily through Banamex and provides traditional retail banking and branded card products to consumers and small business customers and traditional middle-market banking products and services to commercial customers, as well as retirement fund administration and insurance products through certain Banamex affiliate entities. As previously disclosed, Citi completed the separation of Mexico Consumer/SBMM from its
