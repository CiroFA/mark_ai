limits, and excise taxes. During the year ended December 31, 2024, we repurchased shares of our common stock for an aggregate cost of $6.5 billion, including $345 million to repurchase shares of our common stock withheld to satisfy employee withholding tax obligations related to stock-based compensation. As of December 31, 2024, we recorded an estimated excise tax liability of $56 million for share repurchases in 2024. During the year ended December 31, 2024, we remitted excise taxes of $96 million for our share repurchases in 2023. We expect to complete the share repurchases under the remaining authorization of $7.7 billion of the program authorized by our Board of Directors ("the Board") in 2023 by the end of 2026, assuming no major downturn in the travel market. In January 2025, our Board authorized a program to repurchase up to an additional $20 billion of our common stock.
During the year ended December 31, 2024, we paid cash dividends of $1.2 billion. In February 2025, the Board declared a cash dividend of $9.60 per share of common stock, payable on March 31, 2025 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on March 7, 2025.

Commitments, contingencies, and other
At December 31, 2024, we had, in the aggregate, $986 million of non-cancellable purchase obligations individually greater than $10 million, of which $208 million is payable within the next twelve months. Such purchase obligations relate to agreements to purchase goods and services that are enforceable and legally binding, that specify all significant terms, including the quantities to be purchased, price provisions, and the approximate timing of the transaction.
At December 31, 2024, we had lease obligations of $756 million, of which $169 million is payable within the next twelve months. See Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
At December 31, 2024, we had a remaining transition tax liability of $487 million as a result of the Tax Act, which included $257 million reported as "Long-term U.S. transition tax liability" and $230 million included in "Accrued expenses and other current liabilities" in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. This liability will be paid over the next two years. Due to a recent U.S. Tax Court decision in Varian Medical Systems, Inc. vs. Commissioner, a portion of our total transition tax liability may be refunded. In accordance with the Tax Act, generally, future repatriation of our international cash will not be subject to a U.S. federal income tax liability as a dividend, but will be subject to U.S. state income taxes and international withholding taxes, which have been accrued by us.
See Note 16 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for information related to the $650 million standby letters of credit and bank guarantees issued on our behalf at December 31, 2024.
