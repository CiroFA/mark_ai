NOTE 14:
PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS
Net periodic benefit cost or income for our pension and other postretirement benefit plans consisted of the following (in millions):
1
The weighted-average expected long-term rates of return on plan assets used in computing 2025 net periodic benefit cost (income) were
7.00
% for pension plans and
6.75
% for other postretirement benefit plans.
2
The curtailment loss and special termination benefits were related to the group annuity purchase (“buy-in”) for a non-U.S. defined benefit plan. The Company intends to convert the buy-in to a buy-out in the future, at which time the insurer would assume full responsibility for the plan obligations.
All of the amounts in the table above, other than service cost, were recorded in the line item other income (loss) — net in our consolidated statements of income. During the three months ended March 28, 2025, the Company contributed $
11
million to our pension trusts, offset by a $
61
million transfer of surplus non-U.S. plan assets from pension trusts to general assets of the Company. We anticipate making additional contributions of approximately $
18
million during the remainder of 2025. The Company contributed $
6
million to our pension trusts, offset by a $
44
million transfer of surplus non-U.S. plan assets from pension trusts to general assets of the Company during the three months ended March 29, 2024.

The Company’s effective tax rates for the three months ended March 28, 2025 and March 29, 2024 vary from the statutory U.S. federal tax rate of

The Company’s effective tax rate for the three months ended March 28, 2025 included $
143
million of net tax benefits related to various discrete tax items, including net interest income of $
53
million related to the IRS Tax Litigation Deposit recorded in the line item income taxes in our consolidated statement of income, in accordance with our accounting policy, and a tax benefit of $
85
million related to a change in the Company’s indefinite reinvestment assertion for certain foreign entities.
