Fair Value of Debt
At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the estimated fair value of the outstanding debt was approximately $
18.8
billion and $
15.2
billion, respectively, and was considered a "Level 2" fair value measurement (see Note 2). The fair values were estimated based upon actual trades at the end of the reporting period or the most recent trade available as well as the Company's stock price at the end of the reporting period. The estimated fair value of the Company's debt in excess of the outstanding principal amount at December 31, 2024 and 2023 primarily relates to the conversion premium, which is the conversion value in excess of the principal amount, on the convertible senior notes due in May 2025.

Convertible Senior Notes
In April 2020, the Company issued $
863
million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due in May 2025 with an interest rate of
0.75
% (the "May 2025 Notes"). The May 2025 Notes are convertible, subject to certain conditions, into the Company's common stock at a current conversion price of $
1,869.86
per share. The May 2025 Notes were convertible, at the option of the holder, prior to November 1, 2024, upon the occurrence of specific events, including but not limited to a change in control, or if the closing sales price of the Company's common stock for at least
20
trading days in the period of
30
consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter was more than
130
% of the conversion price in effect for the notes on the last trading day of the immediately preceding quarter. In the event that all or substantially all of the Company's common stock is acquired on or prior to the maturity of the May 2025 Notes in a transaction in which the consideration paid to holders of the Company's common stock consists of all or substantially all cash, the Company would be required to make additional payments in the form of shares of common stock to the holders of the May 2025 Notes in an aggregate value ranging from $
0
to $
235
million depending upon the date of the transaction and the then current stock price of the Company. Starting on November 1, 2024, holders have the right to convert all or any portion of the May 2025 Notes, regardless of the Company's stock price. The May 2025 Notes may not be redeemed by the Company prior to maturity. The holders may require the Company to repurchase the May 2025 Notes for cash in certain circumstances. Interest on the May 2025 Notes is payable on May 1 and November 1 of each year. Prior to November 2024, if the note holders exercised their option to convert, the Company delivered cash to repay the principal amount of the May 2025 Notes and had the option to deliver shares of the Company's common stock or cash, to satisfy the conversion premium. As of November 1, 2024, note holders are entitled to repayment of the principal amount of the May 2025 Notes in
