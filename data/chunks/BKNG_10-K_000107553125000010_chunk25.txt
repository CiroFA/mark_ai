career conversations between employees and their managers, as well as succession planning.

are shared with senior management. We believe that the results of our 2024 engagement surveys broadly demonstrate an engaged workforce.
Employee Relations
Although we have works councils or employee representatives in certain countries, our U.S. employees are not represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We work collaboratively with works councils, employee representatives, and other organizations in relevant jurisdictions. We have never had a work stoppage and we consider our relations with our employees to be good.
