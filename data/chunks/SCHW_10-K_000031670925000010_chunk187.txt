How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit
Our audit procedures related to the Company’s systems to process the third-party mutual funds and managed investing solutions within AMAF, and commissions within trading revenue transactions included the following, among others:
•
With the assistance of our IT specialists, we:
◦
Identified the significant systems used to process third-party mutual funds, managed investing solutions, and commissions revenue transactions and, using a risk-based approach, tested the relevant general IT controls over each of these systems.
◦
Performed testing of automated business controls and system interface controls (including batch processing) within the relevant third-party mutual funds, managed investing solutions, and commissions revenue streams.
◦
For a sample of pricing rules, inspected configuration and ascertained that the relevant systems applied appropriate rates and calculated third-party mutual funds, managed investing solutions, and commissions revenue completely and accurately.
•
We tested internal controls within the relevant third-party mutual funds, managed investing solutions, and commissions revenue business processes, including those in place to reconcile the various systems to the Company’s general ledger.
•
We created data visualizations to evaluate recorded third-party mutual funds, managed investing solutions, and commissions revenue and evaluate trends in the data.
•
For a sample of third-party mutual funds, managed investing solutions, and commissions revenue transactions, we performed detail transaction testing by agreeing the amounts recognized to contractual agreements and testing the mathematical accuracy of the recorded revenue.
•
For a sample of accounts, we tested the accuracy and completeness of assets under management by obtaining independent pricing support and reconciling total positions to third-party statements.
