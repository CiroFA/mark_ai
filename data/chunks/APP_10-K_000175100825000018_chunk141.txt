Employee Stock Purchase Plan
The ESPP permits participants to purchase shares of the Company’s Class A common stock through contributions of up to
15
% of their eligible compensation. The ESPP provides for consecutive, overlapping
24-month
offering periods, during which the contributed amount by the participant will be used to purchase shares of the Company’s Class A common stock at the end of each
6-month
purchase period with the purchase price of the shares being
85
% of the lower of the fair market value of the Company’s Class A common stock on the first day of an offering period or on the exercise date. The ESPP has an automatic reset feature, whereby the offering period resets if the fair value of the Company’s common stock on a purchase date is less than that on the original offering date. No participant may purchase, in any one purchase period, more than
590
shares of Class A common stock, or
3,500
shares of Class A common stock for offering periods commencing on or after May 20, 2023. Participants may end their participation at any time during an offering and will be paid their accrued contributions that have not yet been used to purchase shares. Participation ends automatically upon termination of employment with the Company.
A total of
7,800,000
shares of the Company’s Class A common stock were initially reserved for issuance under the ESPP. The number of shares available for issuance under the ESPP also include an annual increase of shares, equal to the least of: (a)
