2025 Credit Facility.
On January 30, 2025, we entered into a credit agreement with certain lenders providing for a $
4.5
billion unsecured short-term revolving credit facility that matures on April 30, 2025 (2025 Credit Facility) to fund a portion of our TurboTax 5-day early refund offering.
Advances under the 2025 Credit Facility accrue interest at a rate equal to, at our election, either (i) the alternate base rate plus a margin of
0.125
%, or (ii) the adjusted daily simple SOFR or term SOFR plus a margin of
1.125
%. Unused portions of the commitment accrue a fee of
0.10
% per annum.
The 2025 Credit Facility includes customary affirmative and negative covenants, including a financial covenant that requires us to maintain a ratio of total gross debt to EBITDA, as defined in the agreement, of not greater than
4.00
to 1.00 as measured on a rolling twelve month basis as of the last day of each fiscal quarter. As of January 31, 2025, we were compliant with all covenants governing the 2025 Credit Facility. As of January 31, 2025, we have not borrowed any amounts under the 2025 Credit Facility. We paid

2019 Secured Facility.
On February 19, 2019, a subsidiary of Intuit entered into a secured revolving credit facility with a lender to fund the lending products and services we offer to qualified small businesses (the 2019 Secured Facility). The 2019 Secured Facility is secured by cash and receivables of the subsidiary and is non-recourse to Intuit Inc. We have entered into several amendments to this facility, most recently on January 31, 2025. These amendments primarily increase the facility limit, extend the commitment term and final maturity date, and update the benchmark interest rate. Under the amended 2019 Secured Facility, the facility limit is $
500
million, of which $
300
million is committed and $
200
million is uncommitted. Advances accrue interest at adjusted daily simple SOFR plus
1.25
%. Unused portions of the committed credit facility accrue a fee at a rate ranging from
0.25
% to
0.75
%, depending on the total unused committed balance. The commitment term is through August 31, 2027, and the final maturity date is August 31, 2028. The agreement includes certain affirmative and negative covenants, including financial covenants that require the subsidiary to maintain specified financial ratios. As of January 31, 2025, we were compliant with all covenants governing the 2019 Secured Facility. At January 31, 2025, $
