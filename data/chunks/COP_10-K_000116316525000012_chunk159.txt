unconventional plays of 88 million barrels, technical revisions of 75 million barrels, continued conversion of acquired Concho Permian two-stream contracts to a three-stream (crude oil, natural gas and NGLs) basis adding 70 million barrels, and higher prices of 13 million barrels. This was partially offset by increasing operating costs of 38 million barrels.

Purchases
: Purchases in 2024 were due to our acquisition of Marathon Oil, resulting in purchases for Lower 48 as well as in Africa, representing reserves in Equatorial Guinea.
•
Extensions and discoveries
: In 2024, Lower 48 extensions and discoveries were primarily within unconventional plays in the Permian Basin. Extensions and discoveries in our equity affiliates were in the Middle East.
In 2023, extensions and discoveries in Lower 48 were primarily within unconventional plays in the Permian Basin. Canada extensions and discoveries were in Montney.
In 2022, extensions and discoveries in Lower 48 were primarily within unconventional plays in the Permian Basin. Extensions and discoveries in our equity affiliates were in the Middle East.
*All Equity Affiliate reserves are located in our Asia Pacific/Middle East Region.
Natural gas production in the reserves table may differ from gas production (delivered for sale) in our statistics disclosure, primarily because the quantities above include gas consumed in production operations. Quantities consumed in production operations are not significant in the periods presented. The value of net production consumed in operations is not reflected in net revenues and production expenses, nor do the volumes impact the respective per unit metrics.
Reserve volumes include natural gas to be consumed in operations of 2,285 BCF, 2,263 BCF and 2,416 BCF, as of December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. These volumes are not included in the calculation of our Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows Relating to Proved Oil and Gas Reserve Quantities.
Natural gas reserves are computed at 14.65 pounds per square inch absolute and 60 degrees Fahrenheit.
Notable changes in proved natural gas reserves in the three years ended December 31, 2024, included:

Revisions
: In 2024, upward revisions in Lower 48 were due to were due to additional development drilling of 841 BCF, technical revisions of 113 BCF, partly offset by downward revisions of 422 BCF for changes in development plans, 127 BCF due to lower prices and 49 BCF due to increasing operating costs. Upward revisions in Alaska of 68 BCF were due to updated total North Slope development phasing, as future production of gas is dependent on the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System minimum flow limit, which will be reached later than previously premised. Further upward revisions in Alaska included 28 BCF from revised development plans and 24 BCF to be consumed in operations. Offsetting downward revisions from technical revisions and costs were 18 BCF. In Europe, technical revisions contributed 64 BCF of
