If any assets remain after any liquidation senior stock is paid in full, those assets will be distributed pro rata among holders of our series A perpetual strike preferred stock and any series of preferred stock with liquidation parity with our series A perpetual strike preferred stock, which we refer to as “liquidation parity stock,” with any remaining assets distributed to holders of our common stock. There may be insufficient remaining assets available to pay the liquidation preference and unpaid accumulated dividends on our series A perpetual strike preferred stock in which case holders of our common stock would not receive any value for their shares. If we issue any dividend senior stock in the future, such dividend senior stock could contain provisions that prohibit us from paying accumulated dividends on our series A perpetual strike preferred stock or purchasing, redeeming or acquiring our series A perpetual strike preferred stock until and unless we first pay accumulated dividends in full on such dividend senior stock.
