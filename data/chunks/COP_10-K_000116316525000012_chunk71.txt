natural gas prices decreased 17 percent from an average of $2.74 per MMBTU in 2023 to $2.27 per MMBTU in 2024. Natural gas prices decreased due to excess North American natural gas storage levels following a mild 2023-2024 winter. Lower 48 segment realized gas prices decreased to $0.18 in the third quarter of 2024 driven by lower regional prices related to pipeline capacity constraints. In the fourth quarter of 2024 prices increased as constraints were relieved and realizations ended the year at an average of $0.87.
Our realized bitumen price increased 14 percent from an average of $42.15 per barrel in 2023 to $47.92 per barrel in 2024. The increase was driven by narrowing WCS differentials due to Trans Mountain Expansion project egress, tightening Russian sanctions impacting global heavy oil supply and improving heavy oil demand in Asia. We continue to optimize bitumen price realizations through optimizing diluent recovery unit operation, blending and transportation strategies.
Our worldwide annual average realized price decreased six percent from $58.39 per BOE in 2023 to $54.83 per BOE in 2024 primarily due to lower crude and natural gas prices.
