Part I
JPMorganChase’s businesses depend, are unable to meet the requirements of JPMorganChase’s businesses and operations or bank regulatory standards, or if they fail or have other significant shortcomings, JPMorganChase could be materially and adversely affected.
A successful cyber attack affecting JPMorganChase could cause significant harm to JPMorganChase and its clients and customers.
JPMorganChase experiences numerous cyber attacks on its computer systems, software, networks and other technology assets on a daily basis from various actors, including groups acting on behalf of hostile countries, cyber-criminals, “hacktivists” (i.e., individuals or groups that use technology to promote a political agenda or social change) and others. These cyber attacks can take many forms, including attempts to introduce computer viruses or malicious code, which are commonly referred to as “malware,” into JPMorganChase’s systems. These attacks are often designed to:
•
obtain unauthorized access to JPMorganChase's systems or to confidential information belonging to JPMorganChase or its clients, customers, counterparties or employees
•
manipulate data
•
destroy data or systems with the aim of rendering services unavailable
•
disrupt, sabotage or degrade service on JPMorganChase’s systems

steal money, or
•
extort money through the use of so-called “ransomware.”
