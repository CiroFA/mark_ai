For a description of how the Company accounts for derivative instruments, see Note 2. For additional information on the basis of presentation for derivative instruments on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets and related offsetting considerations, see Note 18.
Fair Value Hedges of Interest Rate Risk
The Company is exposed to changes in the fair value of its fixed-rate AFS securities and Senior Notes, as well as its fixed-to-floating rate Senior Notes during the fixed-rate period, due to changes in benchmark interest rates. The Company uses cleared interest rate swaps to manage its exposure to changes in fair value of these instruments attributable to changes in the designated benchmark interest rate. Cleared interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges of AFS securities involve the payment of fixed-rate amounts to a CCP in exchange for the Company receiving floating-rate payments over the life of the agreements. Cleared interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges of Senior Notes involve the receipt of fixed-rate amounts from a CCP in exchange for the Company’s floating-rate payments over the life of the agreements.
The Company had outstanding interest rate swaps with aggregate notional amounts of $
30.9
billion and $
8.9
billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, that were designated as fair value hedges of interest rate risk. The notional amount is the basis upon which the pay-fixed/receive-float and receive-fixed/pay-float payments are determined; however, the amount is not exchanged.

10
million reduction of derivative liabilities related to variation margin settlements. At December 31, 2023, there was an $
