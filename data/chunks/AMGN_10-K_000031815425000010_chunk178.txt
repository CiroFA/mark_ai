Interest rate swaps
To achieve a desired mix of fixed-rate and floating-rate debt, we enter into interest rate swap contracts that effectively convert fixed-rate interest coupons for certain of our debt instruments to floating SOFR-based coupons over the terms of the respective debt instruments. These interest rate swap contracts qualify and are designated as fair value hedges. For information regarding the terms of these contracts, see Note 19, Derivative instruments.
Cross-currency swaps
To hedge our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with certain of our long-term notes denominated in foreign currencies, we entered into cross-currency swap contracts. The terms of these contracts outstanding as of December 31, 2024, effectively convert the interest payments and principal repayments on our
2.00
% 2026 euro Notes,
5.50
% 2026 pound sterling Notes and
4.00
% 2029 pound sterling Notes from euros and pounds sterling to U.S. dollars. These cross-currency swap contracts have been designated as cash flow hedges. For information regarding the terms of these contracts, see Note 19, Derivative instruments. Cross-currency swap contracts associated with other foreign denominated debt previously outstanding were settled in connection with the repayment of such debt, as discussed above.
