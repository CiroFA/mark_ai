Shareholders’ equity
All of Chubb’s Common Shares are authorized under Swiss corporate law. Though the par value of Common Shares is stated in Swiss francs, Chubb continues to use U.S. dollars as its reporting currency for preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements. Under Swiss corporate law, dividends, including distributions from legal reserves or through a reduction in par value (par value reduction), must be stated in Swiss francs though dividend payments are made by Chubb in U.S. dollars. At March 31, 2025, our Common Shares had a par value of CHF
0.50
per share.
At our May 2024 and 2023 annual general meetings, our shareholders approved annual dividends for the following year of up to $
3.64
per share and $
3.44
per share, respectively, which were paid in four quarterly installments of $
0.91
per share and $
0.86
per share, respectively, at dates determined by the Board of Directors (Board) after the annual general meetings by way of a distribution from capital contribution reserves, transferred to free reserves for payment.
Dividend distributions per Common Share for the three months ended March 31, 2025, and 2024, were $
0.91

0.81

Increases in Common Shares in treasury are due to open market repurchases of Common Shares and the surrender of Common Shares to satisfy tax withholding obligations in connection with the vesting of restricted stock and the forfeiture of unvested restricted stock. Decreases in Common Shares in treasury are principally due to grants of restricted stock, exercises of stock options, purchases under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP), and share cancellations.
