As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the following amounts were recorded on the Consolidated balance sheets related to certain cumulative fair value hedge basis adjustments that are expected to reverse through the income statement in future periods as an adjustment to yield.
(a)
Excludes physical commodities with a carrying value of $
6.2
billion and $
5.6
billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, to which the Firm applies fair value hedge accounting. As a result of the application of hedge accounting, these inventories are carried at fair value, thus recognizing unrealized gains and losses in current periods. Since the Firm exits these positions at fair value, there is no incremental impact to net income in future periods.
(b)
Excludes hedged items where only foreign currency risk is the designated hedged risk, as basis adjustments related to foreign currency hedges will not reverse through the income statement in future periods. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the carrying amount excluded for AFS securities was $
28.7
billion and $
19.3
billion, respectively. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the carrying amount excluded for long-term debt was $
518
million and
zero
, respectively.

72.8
billion and $
83.9
billion, of which $
41.2
billion and $
68.0
billion was designated as hedged, respectively. The amount designated as hedged is the sum of the notional amounts of all outstanding layers in each portfolio, which includes both spot starting and forward starting layers. At December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the cumulative amount of basis adjustments was $(
1.7

) million, which is comprised of $(
