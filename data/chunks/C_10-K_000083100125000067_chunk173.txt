Corporate Loans
Corporate loans represent loans and leases managed by

All Other
â€”Legacy Franchises. Corporate loans are placed on a cash (non-accrual) basis when it is determined, based on actual experience and a forward-looking assessment of the collectibility of the loan in full, that the payment of interest or principal is doubtful or when interest or principal is

days past due, except when the loan is well collateralized and in the process of collection. When a corporate loan is placed on non-accrual, any interest accrued is reversed and charged against current earnings, and interest is thereafter included in earnings only to the extent actually received in cash. When there is doubt regarding the ultimate collectibility of principal, all cash receipts are thereafter applied to reduce the recorded investment in the loan. Cash-basis loans are returned to accrual status when all contractual principal and interest amounts are reasonably assured of repayment and there is a sustained period of repayment performance in accordance with the contractual terms.
Corporate loans are written down to the extent that principal is deemed to be uncollectible.
A financial asset is considered collateral-dependent when the debtor is experiencing financial difficulty and repayment is expected to be provided substantially through the operation or sale of the collateral. For corporate loans that are collateral dependent, the fair value of collateral (less costs to sell, as applicable) is used to estimate expected credit losses.
