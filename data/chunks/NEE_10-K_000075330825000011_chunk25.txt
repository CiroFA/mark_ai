the sale of energy from clean energy facilities, such as wind and solar energy facilities and energy storage facilities. The development of clean energy projects at acceptable prices has not historically been burdened by actions taken by the U.S. government. However, as a result of budgetary constraints, geopolitical factors, political factors or otherwise, governments from time to time may review their laws and policies that support, or do not overly burden, the development and operation of clean energy facilities and, instead, consider actions that would make the laws and policies less conducive to the development and operation of such projects. Any reductions or modifications to, or the elimination of, governmental incentives or policies that support clean energy, such as PTCs or ITCs, or the imposition of additional taxes, tariffs, duties or other costs or assessments on clean energy or the equipment necessary to generate, store or deliver it, such as policies in place that limit certain imports from China and other Southeast Asian countries, could result in, among other items, the lack of a satisfactory market for the development and/or financing of new clean energy projects, NEE and FPL abandoning the development of clean energy projects, a loss of investments in the projects and reduced project returns, any of which could have a material adverse effect on NEE's and FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
NEE's and FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely affected by new or revised laws, regulations or executive orders, as well as by regulatory action or inaction.
NEE's and FPL's business could be materially adversely affected by a variety of legal activity, such as: 1) the adoption of new or revised laws, such as international trade laws, regulations and interpretations; 2) constitutional ballot or regulatory initiatives, such as those seeking deregulation or restructuring of the energy industry; 3) new or revised regulations, such as those affecting the commodities trading and derivatives markets, emissions, water consumption, water discharges, wetlands, gas and oil infrastructure operations, and environmental and other permitting requirements for energy infrastructure projects; 4) actions taken, or not taken, by government agencies as a result of executive orders, such as failing to issue, delaying the issuance of, or increasing the requirements necessary to obtain approvals, rights-of-way, permits, determinations, leases or loans related to wind or other clean energy projects; and 5) changes in the way government interprets or applies laws, regulations and orders. Changes in the nature of the regulation of NEE's and FPL's business through this type or other types of legal activity could have a material adverse effect on NEE's and FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. NEE and FPL are unable to predict future
