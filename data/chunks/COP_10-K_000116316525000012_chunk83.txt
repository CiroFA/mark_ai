As of December 31, 2024, in addition to the priorities described above, we have contractual obligations to purchase goods and services of approximately $31.6 billion. We expect to fulfill $7.5 billion of these obligations in 2025. These figures exclude purchase commitments for jointly owned fields and facilities where we are not the operator. Purchase obligations of $13.0 billion are related to agreements to access and utilize the capacity of third-party equipment and facilities, including pipelines and LNG product terminals, to transport, process, treat and store commodities. Purchase obligations of $16.8 billion are related to market-based contracts for commodity product purchases with third parties. The remainder is primarily our net share of purchase commitments for materials and services for jointly owned fields and facilities where we are the operator.
