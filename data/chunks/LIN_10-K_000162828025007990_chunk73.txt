Comparative funded status information as of

The changes in plan assets and benefit obligations recognized in other comprehensive income in 2024 and 2023 are as follows:
* Pension net actuarial gains in 2024 are largely driven by continued
increase in the discount rate environment in U.S. and non-U.S. plans resulting in actuarial gains from a lower PBO as well as favorable plan asset experience for the U.S. plans
.  In 2023, the actuarial losses were largely driven by the decrease in the discount rate environment resulting from a higher PBO, which was partially offset by favorable plan asset experience for non-U.S plans. The U.S. plan derived a benefit from the actual return on plan assets.
The following table provides information only for those individual pension plans where the accumulated benefit obligation exceeds the fair value of plan assets:

Assumptions
The assumptions used to determine benefit obligations are as of the respective balance sheet dates and the assumptions used to determine net benefit cost are as of the previous year-end, as shown below:
(1)
The expected long term rate of return on the U.S. and non-U.S. plan assets is estimated based on the plans' investment strategy and asset allocation, historical capital market performance and, to a lesser extent, historical plan per
formance.
For the U.S. plans, the expected rate of return of
7.00
% was derived based on the target asset allocation of
50
%-
70
% equity securities (approximately
7.20
% expected return),
20
%-
50
% fixed income securities (approximately
4.70
% expected return) and
2
%-
8
% alternative investments (approximately
4.30
% expected return).  For the main non-U.S. plans, the expected rate of return was derived based on the weighted average target asset allocation of
15
%-
25
% equity securities (approximately
5.30
% expected return),
30
%-
50
% fixed income securities (approximately
5.80
% expected return), and
30
%-
50
% alternative investments (approximately
5.60
% expected return).
For the U.S. plan assets, the actual annualized total return for the most recent
10
-year period ended
December 31, 2024
was approximately
7.20
%. For the non-U.S. plan assets, the actual annualized total return for the same period was approximately
4.00
%. Changes to
plan asset allocations and investment strategy over this time period limit the value of historical plan performance as a factor in estimating the expected long term rate of return.
