500
million (

at FPL) and $
510
million (
none
at FPL) at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. If FPL's and NEECH's credit ratings were downgraded to below investment grade, applicable NEE subsidiaries would be required to post additional collateral such that the total posted collateral would be approximately $
2.4
billion ($
25
million at FPL) and $
2.4
billion ($
15
million at FPL) at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Some derivative contracts do not contain credit ratings downgrade triggers, but do contain provisions that require certain financial measures be maintained and/or have credit-related cross-default triggers. In the event these provisions were triggered, applicable NEE subsidiaries could be required to post additional collateral of up to approximately $
1.4
billion ($
70
million at FPL) and $
1.7
billion ($
50
million at FPL) at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
Collateral related to derivatives, including amounts posted for margin, current exposures and future performance with exchanges and independent system operators, may be posted in the form of cash or credit support in the normal course of business. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, applicable NEE subsidiaries have posted approximately $
19
million (
none
at FPL) and $
691
million (
none
at FPL), respectively, in cash and $
1,334
million (
none
at FPL) and $
1,595
million (
none
at FPL), respectively, in the form of letters of credit and surety bonds each of which could be applied toward the collateral requirements described above. FPL and NEECH have capacity under their credit facilities generally in excess of the collateral requirements described above that would be available to support, among other things, derivative activities. Under the terms of the credit facilities, maintenance of a specific credit rating is not a condition to drawing on these credit facilities, although there are other conditions to drawing on these credit facilities.
Additionally, some contracts contain certain adequate assurance provisions whereby a counterparty may demand additional collateral based on subjective events and/or conditions. Due to the subjective nature of these provisions, NEE and FPL are unable to determine an exact value for these items and they are not included in any of the quantitative disclosures above.

Non-Derivative Fair Value Measurements
Non-derivative fair value measurements consist of NEE’s and FPL’s cash equivalents and restricted cash equivalents, special use funds and other investments. The fair value of these financial assets is determined by using the valuation techniques and inputs as described in Note 3 – Fair Value Measurements of Derivative Instruments as well as below.
Cash Equivalents
and Restricted Cash Equivalents
– NEE and FPL hold investments primarily in money market funds. The fair value of these funds is estimated using a market approach based on current observable market prices.
Special Use Funds and Other Investments
– NEE and
