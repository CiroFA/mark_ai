service periods were estimated using the Monte Carlo simulation. Stock-based compensation expense is recognized on a graded vesting basis over the requisite service period for each respective tranche, but not shorter than the
two-year
minimum service period, and includes an assessment of when it is probable the performance condition will be achieved, which involves a subjective assessment of our future financial projections.
As of December 31, 2024, total unrecognized compensation cost, adjusted for estimated forfeitures, related to unvested stock options was approximately $
7
million. The weighted-average remaining vesting period of unvested stock options as of December 31, 2024 was approximately
one year
.
RSUs
A summary of RSU activity for the year ended December 31, 2024 was as follows:
RSUs outstanding as of December 31, 2024 were comprised of
5.3
million RSUs with only service conditions and
0.5
million RSUs with both service conditions and performance conditions, including certain RSUs with additional market conditions. The total intrinsic value of the RSUs vested was $
2.4
billion, $
1.6
billion and $
1.5
billion for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. As of December 31, 2024, the aggregate intrinsic value of RSUs outstanding was $
6.1
billion and RSUs expected to vest was $
5.5
billion. The weighted-average grant-date fair value of RSUs granted was $

, $
479.18
and $
541.24
per share for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
PRSUs have service, performance and market vesting conditions. The ultimate number of shares eligible to vest range from
0
% to
200
%, subject to our board of directors compensation committee’s approval of performance metrics achievement and, for certain PRSUs, total shareholder return relative to that of the S&P 500 index. The eligible shares subject to PRSUs granted during the year ended December 31, 2024 will vest in
one
to
three years
contingent on each holder’s continuous status as an employee on the applicable vesting dates. The number of PRSUs granted included in the table above reflects the shares that could be eligible to vest at
100
% of target for PRSUs and includes adjustments for over or under achievement for PRSUs granted in the prior year.
