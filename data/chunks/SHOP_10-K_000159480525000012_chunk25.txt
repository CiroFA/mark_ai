business consists of small and medium-sized businesses. Small and medium-sized businesses tend to be more susceptible than larger businesses to general economic conditions and other business-related risks, which has, and may continue to, contribute to merchant turnover. These businesses may be particularly susceptible to changes in economic conditions, including pressure from inflation, declines in consumer spending, international trade risks and/or the imposition of trade protection measures (such as the imposition of or an increase in tariffs or import and export licensing and control requirements), global supply chain disruptions and shortages including events impacting shipping and fulfillment all of which may negatively impact a merchant’s business and in turn, negatively impact our business. Large merchants generally require higher service levels and have more complex needs than small and medium-sized businesses. As we look to further tailor our sales strategies to attract large volume brands, we may face elevated costs, extended onboarding cycles and decreased predictability in finalizing the sale of products and services to these merchants. If we fall short of meeting the requirements of these merchants, it could impede our ability to grow within the enterprise market.
