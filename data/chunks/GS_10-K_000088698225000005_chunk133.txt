repurchase (repurchase agreements), accounted for as collateralized financings, were $274.38 billion as of December 2024 and $249.89 billion as of December 2023, which were 5% higher as of December 2024 and 21% higher as of December 2023 than the average daily amount of repurchase agreements over the respective quarters, and 9% higher as of December 2024 and 26% higher as of December 2023 than the average daily amount of repurchase agreements over the respective years. As of December 2024, the increase in our repurchase agreements relative to the average daily amount of repurchase agreements during the quarter and year resulted from lower levels of our and our clients’ activities at the end of the period.
The level of our repurchase agreements fluctuates between and within periods, primarily due to providing clients with access to highly liquid collateral, such as certain government and agency obligations, through collateralized financing activities.
The table below presents information about our balance sheet and leverage ratios.
In the table above:
•
The leverage ratio equals total assets divided by total shareholders’ equity and measures the proportion of equity and debt we use to finance assets. This ratio is different from the leverage ratios included in Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements.
•
The debt-to-equity ratio equals unsecured long-term borrowings divided by total shareholders’ equity.
The table below presents information about our shareholders’ equity and book value per common share, including the reconciliation of common shareholders’ equity to tangible common shareholders’ equity.
In the table above:
•
Tangible common shareholders’ equity is calculated as total shareholders’ equity less preferred stock, goodwill and identifiable intangible assets. We believe that tangible common shareholders’ equity is meaningful because it is a measure that we and investors use to assess capital adequacy. Tangible common shareholders’ equity is a non-GAAP measure and may not be comparable to similar non-GAAP measures used by other companies.
•
Book value per common share and tangible book value per common share are based on common shares outstanding and restricted stock units granted to employees with no future service requirements and not subject to performance or market conditions (collectively, basic shares) of 322.9 million as of December 2024 and 337.1 million as of December 2023. We believe that tangible book value per common share (tangible common shareholders’ equity divided by basic shares) is meaningful because it is a measure that we and investors use to assess capital adequacy. Tangible book value per common share is a non-GAAP measure and may not be comparable to similar non-GAAP measures used by other companies.
