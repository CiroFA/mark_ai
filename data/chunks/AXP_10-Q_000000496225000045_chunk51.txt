Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements
We have certain assets that are subject to measurement at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. For these assets, measurement at fair value in periods subsequent to their initial recognition is applicable if they are determined to be impaired or where there are observable price changes for equity investments without readily determinable fair values.
We estimate the Level 3 fair value of equity investments without readily determinable fair values, which include investments in our Amex Ventures portfolio, based on price changes as of the date of new similar equity financing transactions completed by the companies in the portfolio. In addition, impairments on such investments are recorded to account for the difference between the estimated fair value and carrying value of an investment based on a qualitative assessment of impairment indicators such as business performance, general market conditions and the economic and regulatory environment. When an impairment triggering event occurs, the fair value measurement is generally derived by taking into account all available information, such as share prices of publicly traded peer companies, internal valuations performed by our investees, and other third-party fair value data. The fair value of impaired investments represents a Level 3 fair value measurement.
The carrying value of equity investments without readily determinable fair values totaled $
0.9
billion as of both March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, of which investments representing nonrecurring Level 3 fair value measurement were
nil
and $
1
million as of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively. These amounts are included within Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
We recorded
no
unrealized gains for both the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024. Unrealized losses were $
39
million and
nil
for the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively. Unrealized gains and losses are recorded in Other, net on the Consolidated Statements of Income. Since the adoption of new accounting guidance on the recognition and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities on January 1, 2018, cumulative unrealized gains for equity investments without readily determinable fair values totaled $
1.1
billion as of both March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, and cumulative unrealized losses were $
499
million and $
460
million as of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively.
