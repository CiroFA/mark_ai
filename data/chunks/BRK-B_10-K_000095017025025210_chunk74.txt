CTB competes with a variety of manufacturers and suppliers, including many that offer only a limited number of the products offered by CTB, as well as a few that offer products across several of CTB’s product lines. Competition is based on the price, value, reputation, quality and design of the products offered and the customer service provided by distributors, dealers and manufacturers of the products. CTB’s leading brand names, distribution network, diversified product line, product support and high-quality products enable it to compete effectively. CTB manufactures its products primarily from galvanized steel, steel wire, stainless steel and polymer materials. The availability of these materials in recent years has been adequate.
