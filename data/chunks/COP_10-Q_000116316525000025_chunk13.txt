Contingent Payments
In October 2023, we completed our acquisition of the remaining
50
percent working interest in Surmont, an asset in our Canada segment, from TotalEnergies EP Canada Ltd. The consideration for the acquisition contained a contingent consideration arrangement that requires additional consideration to be paid to TotalEnergies EP Canada Ltd. up to $
0.4
billion CAD over a
five-year
term. The contingent payments represent $
2
million for every dollar that WCS pricing exceeds $
52
per barrel during the month, subject to certain production targets being achieved. The undiscounted amount we could pay under this arrangement was up to $
0.3
billion USD at closing. The fair value of the contingent consideration on the acquisition date was $
320
million and estimated by applying the income approach. Since the acquisition, we have made payments of $
197
million USD under this arrangement, included in the "Other" line within the Financing Activities section of our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.
