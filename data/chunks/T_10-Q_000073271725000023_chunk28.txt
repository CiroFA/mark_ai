COMPETITIVE AND REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT
Overview
AT&T subsidiaries operating within the United States are subject to federal and state regulations. AT&T subsidiaries operating outside the United States are subject to the jurisdiction of national and supranational regulations in the markets where service is provided. Complying with these regulations may affect our results of operations and cash flow, and compliance may be very costly. For a discussion of these regulations, please see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation—Regulatory Landscape” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year-ended December 31, 2024.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
We had $6,885 in cash and cash equivalents available at March 31, 2025, increasing $3,587 since December 31, 2024. Cash and cash equivalents included cash of $1,122 and money market funds and other cash equivalents of $5,763. Approximately $1,159 of our cash and cash equivalents were held in accounts outside of the U.S. and may be subject to restrictions on repatriation.
For the first three months of 2025, cash inflows were primarily provided by cash receipts from operations, including cash from our sale and transfer of our receivables to third parties, and distributions from DIRECTV. These inflows exceeded cash used to meet the needs of the business, including, but not limited to, payment of operating expenses, including higher device payments from higher sales volumes. The cash generated
from operating activities was primarily used to repay long-term debt, make dividend payments to stockholders and to fund capital improvements. We maintain availability under our credit facilities and our commercial paper program to meet our short-term liquidity requirements.
Cash Provided by Operating Activities
During the first three months of 2025, cash provided by operating activities was $9,049, compared to $7,547 for the first three months of 2024, with increases resulting from higher cash flows related to DIRECTV, including a first-quarter 2025 dividend of $1,138, and operational growth.
We actively manage the timing of our supplier payments for operating items to optimize the use of our cash. Among other things, we seek to make payments on 90-day or greater terms, while providing the suppliers with access to bank facilities that permit earlier payments at their cost (referred to as supplier financing program). In addition, for payments to suppliers of handset inventory, as part of our working capital initiatives, we have arrangements that allow us to extend the
