Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2024, our material cash requirements for the operations of our business consisted primarily of the current and long-term liabilities noted on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as well as other commitments, including the following notable items:
•
payments of outstanding borrowings, including interest on long-term debt (see Note 11. Debt and Credit Facilities);
•
income tax payments, including the remaining obligations for the one-time repatriation transition tax from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, as well as potential payments related to uncertain tax positions (see Note 16. Income Taxes);
•
payments of operating lease obligations (see Note 12. Leases);
•
payments related to certain unconditional inventory purchase obligations and capital expenditures. There were no changes to such commitments in the current year that would have a material impact on our ability to meet short- or long-term cash requirements;
•
payments related to our acquisitions, including contingent consideration (see Notes 3. Fair Value Measurements and 6. Acquisitions); and
•
milestone and other payments related to collaboration agreements (see Note 7. Collaborations and Other Arrangements). We are contractually obligated to make payments to our collaboration partners upon the achievement of various development, regulatory and commercial milestones as well as royalty payments. These payments are contingent upon the occurrence of various future events, substantially all of which have a high degree of uncertainty of occurring. If milestones for multiple products covered by these arrangements happen to be reached in the same reporting period, the aggregate cash requirement could be material. It is not possible to predict with reasonable certainty whether these milestones will be achieved or the timing for achievement. As such, these obligations are not recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets until the events triggering milestone payments occur.
Our anticipated sources of funds to satisfy the above material cash requirements for the short- and long-term include our current balances of cash and cash equivalents as well as future cash flows from operations. If needed, we also have the ability to utilize our $2.5 billion revolving credit facility (see Note 11. Debt and Credit Facilities) and access other external capital through future debt or equity offerings.
While we are not aware of any trends at this time that are reasonably likely to materially impact our future cash requirements and sources of funds, such requirements and funds will depend on many factors, including but not limited to the following:
•
the commercial performance of our current and future products;
•
the progress and scope of our R&D efforts and those of our collaboration partners, including preclinical studies and clinical trials;
•
the cost, timing and outcome of regulatory reviews;
•
the expansion of our sales and marketing capabilities;
