personal information, could subject JPMorganChase to inquiries, examinations and investigations that could result in requirements to modify or cease certain operations or practices, significant liabilities or regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions. Any of these could damage JPMorganChase’s reputation and otherwise adversely affect its businesses.
In recent years, well-publicized incidents involving the inappropriate collection, use, sharing or storage of personal information have led to expanded governmental scrutiny of practices relating to the processing or safeguarding of personal information by companies in the U.S. and other countries. That scrutiny has in some cases resulted in, and could in the future lead to, the adoption of stricter laws, rules and regulations relating to the collection, use, sharing and storage of personal information. These types of laws, rules and regulations can prohibit or significantly restrict financial services firms such as JPMorganChase from transferring information across national borders or sharing information among affiliates or with third parties such as vendors, thereby
increase compliance costs and operational risk, or restrict JPMorganChase’s use of personal information when developing or offering products or services to customers. Some countries are considering or have adopted legislation implementing data protection requirements or requiring local storage and processing of data which could increase the cost and complexity of JPMorganChase’s delivery of products and services. These restrictions could also inhibit JPMorganChase’s development or marketing of certain products or services, or increase the costs of offering them to customers.
JPMorganChase’s operations, results and reputation could be harmed by occurrences of extraordinary events beyond its control.

•
cyber attacks
•
security breaches of its physical premises, including threats to health and safety
•
power, telecommunications or internet outages, or shutdowns of mass transit
