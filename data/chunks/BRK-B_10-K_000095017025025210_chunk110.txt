and the supply of available business is affected by the timing of underlying legal claim settlements. In 2023 and 2024, premium rates for new business were at unacceptable levels and we wrote no new business in either year.
Pre-tax underwriting losses from periodic payment annuity contracts in each period included the accretion of discounted liabilities, including liabilities for contracts without life contingencies, and foreign currency exchange gains and losses on non-U.S. Dollar denominated contracts. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates were insignificant in 2024 and produced pre-tax losses of $60 million in 2023 and pre-tax gains of $71 million in 2022. Pre-tax underwriting losses before foreign currency effects were $596 million in 2024, $590 million in 2023 and $694 million in 2022. Pre-tax losses included a loss of approximately $130 million in 2022 from the settlement of a terminated reinsurance contract. Periodic payment annuity liabilities were $14.3 billion at December 31, 2024, including liabilities of $4.0 billion for contracts without life contingencies, and excluding the effects of discount rate changes recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income.
Variable annuity
Our variable annuity guarantee reinsurance contracts produced pre-tax earnings of $157 million in 2024, $233 million in 2023 and $467 million in 2022. Earnings are affected by changes in securities markets, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. These contracts have been in run-off for many years.
Insurance—Investment Income
A summary of net investment income attributable to our insurance operations follows (dollars in millions).

* Not meaningful.
Interest and other investment income increased $5.5 billion in 2024 compared to 2023, which increased $4.4 billion compared to 2022. The increase in 2024 was primarily attributable to increases in U.S. Treasury Bill and short-term investment balances. The increase in 2023 over 2022 was due to increased short-term investment balances and higher interest rates, as well as the impact of income earned from Alleghany’s insurance subsidiary assets acquired in October 2022. We continue to believe that maintaining ample liquidity is paramount and we insist on safety over yield with respect to short-term investments.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis
Insurance—Investment Income
Dividend income declined $302 million (5.5%) in 2024 compared to 2023, which declined $539 million (8.9%) compared to 2022.

Dividend income varies from period to period due to changes in the investment portfolio and the frequency and timing of dividends from certain investees.
