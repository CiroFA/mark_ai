Keytruda
is an anti-PD-1 therapy that has been approved in over 40 indications in the U.S., including 18 tumor types and 2 tumor-agnostic indications, and has similarly been approved in markets worldwide for many of these indications. The
Keytruda
clinical development program includes studies across a broad range of cancer types.
Global sales of
Keytruda
grew 18% in 2024, or 22% excluding the unfavorable effect of foreign exchange. The negative impact of foreign exchange was primarily due to the devaluation of the Argentine peso, which was largely offset by inflation-related price increases consistent with practice in that market.

sales growth in international markets reflects higher demand predominately for the TNBC, melanoma and RCC earlier-stage indications, as well as uptake in cervical, gastric and renal cell cancer metastatic indications. The Company expects that the 2025 launch and reimbursement of new indications for

in the EU will have a negative impact on pricing in those markets.
