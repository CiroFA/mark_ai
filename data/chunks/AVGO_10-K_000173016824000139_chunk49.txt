portion of the tax liability, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results. Further, if the VMware Merger results in the spin-off failing to qualify as a tax-free transaction under Section 355 of the Internal Revenue Code, Dell, its affiliates and, potentially, its stockholders would incur significant tax liabilities and we may be required to indemnify Dell and its affiliates for any such tax liabilities, which could be material.

Risks Related to Our Indebtedness
Our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health and our ability to execute our business strategy.
As of November 3, 2024, the aggregate indebtedness was $69,847 million. Our substantial indebtedness and the instruments governing our indebtedness could have important consequences including:
•
increasing our vulnerability to adverse general economic and industry conditions;
•
exposing us to interest rate risk as our 2023 Term Loans bear floating interest rates;
•
limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in the economy and the industries in which we operate;
•
placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors with less indebtedness;
•
making it more difficult to borrow additional funds in the future to fund growth, acquisitions, working capital, capital expenditures and other purposes; and
•
potentially requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund our other business needs.
We receive debt ratings from the major credit rating agencies in the U.S., and any downgrade in our credit rating or the ratings of our indebtedness, or adverse conditions in the debt capital markets, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
