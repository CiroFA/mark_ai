produce anticipated results, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
•
We have made and expect to continue to make acquisitions, divestitures and other strategic transactions to strengthen our business and grow our Company. For example, we acquired Visible Alpha, World Hydrogen Leaders and ProntoNLP on May 1, 2024, May 14, 2024, and December 31, 2024, respectively, and we sold Fincentric and our PrimeOne business on August 15, 2024 and November 1, 2024, respectively.  Such transactions present significant challenges and risks, as the market for acquisitions, divestitures and other strategic transactions is highly competitive, especially in light of industry consolidation, which affects our ability to complete such transactions.
•
If we are unsuccessful in completing such transactions or if such opportunities for expansion do not arise, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected.
•
If such transactions are completed, the anticipated growth and other strategic objectives of such transactions may not be fully realized or may take longer to realize than expected, and a variety of factors may adversely affect any anticipated benefits from such transactions. Our acquisitions, divestitures and other strategic transactions face difficulties, including, but not limited to, the following:
◦
the process of integration being more expensive or requiring more resources than anticipated;
◦
an acquisition changing the composition of our markets and product mix, and difficulty gaining the skills necessary for such markets or products;
◦
delays or difficulties consolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures and eliminating duplicative operations, including issues in integrating financial reporting, information technology infrastructure, data and content management systems and product platforms, communications and other systems;
◦
delays or difficulties harmonizing corporate cultures, operating practices, management philosophies, employee development and compensation programs, internal controls, compliance programs and other policies, procedures and processes;
◦
assuming unintended liabilities;
◦
unexpected regulatory and operating difficulties and expenditures, including regulatory challenges that impact our ability to conduct due diligence;
◦
failure to maintain employee morale or retain key personnel of the current or acquired business;
◦
failure to retain existing business and operational relationships;
◦
continuing operational or financial obligations that arise under transition services agreements requiring significant management and operational resources that limit our ability to fully implement cost reduction and efficiency initiatives or other aspects of our transition plans, or divert the management’s focus from other business operations;
