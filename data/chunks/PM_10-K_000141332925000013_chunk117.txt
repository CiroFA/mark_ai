Revolving Credit Facilities
On December 17, 2024, we entered into a credit agreement, effective as of January 29, 2025, relating to a senior unsecured revolving credit facility with borrowings up to an aggregate principal amount of €1.5 billion, (approximately $1.6 billion) expiring on January 29, 2028. Concurrently, we did not request an extension of the maturity date of the existing 364-day revolving credit facility and the facility matured on January 28, 2025.
At February 6, 2025, our committed revolving credit facilities were as follows:
(1)
On January 28, 2022, we entered into an agreement, effective February 10, 2022, to amend and extend the term of our $2.0 billion multi-year revolving credit facility, for an additional year covering the period February 11, 2026 to February 10, 2027, in the amount of $1.9 billion.
(2)
Includes business transformation-linked pricing adjustments that may result in the reduction or increase in both the interest rate and commitment fee under the credit agreement if PMI achieves, or fails to achieve, certain specified targets based on its business transformation goals.
(3)
On September 20, 2022, we entered into an agreement, effective September 29, 2022, to amend and extend the term of our $2.5 billion multi-year revolving credit facility, for an additional year covering the period September 30, 2026 to September 29, 2027, in the amount of $2.3 billion. On September 20, 2023, PMI entered into an agreement, effective September 29, 2023, to amend and further extend the term to September 29, 2028.
At February 6, 2025, there were no borrowings under the committed revolving credit facilities, and the entire committed amounts were available for borrowing.
All banks participating in our committed revolving credit facilities have an investment-grade long-term credit rating from the credit rating agencies.  We continuously monitor the credit quality of our banking group, and at this time we are not aware of any potential non-performing credit provider.
These committed revolving credit facilities do not include any credit rating triggers, material adverse change clauses or any provisions that could require us to post collateral. We expect to continue to meet our covenants.
In addition to the committed revolving credit facilities discussed above, PMI maintains certain short-term credit arrangements, including uncommitted credit lines, to primarily meet working capital needs. These credit arrangements amounted to approximately $2.1 billion at December 31, 2024 and approximately $2.7 billion at December 31, 2023.  Borrowings under these arrangements and other bank loans amounted to $137 million at December 31, 2024, and $283 million at December 31, 2023.
