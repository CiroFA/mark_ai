expenses in connection with Pillar Two in
the
three months ended

.
Based on our assessment of the realizability of our deferred tax assets as of
March 31, 2025
, we continue to maintain valuation
allowances against our deferred tax assets in the U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions, primarily due to cumulative losses in those
jurisdictions. Given the current year profit and anticipated future profitability in the U.S., it is reasonably possible that the continued
improvement in our U.S. operations could result in the positive evidence necessary to warrant the release of a significant portion of our U.S.
valuation allowance as early as the second half of 2025. A release of the valuation allowance would result in the recognition of certain U.S.
deferred tax assets and a corresponding benefit in our provision for income taxes in the period the release occurs.

EARNINGS PER SHARE INFORMATION
.
On
April 2, 2024
, there were approximately
274
million
shares of GE Vernova
common stock outstanding. The computation of basic and diluted earnings (loss) per common share for all periods t
hrough
April 1, 2024
was calculated using
274
million
common shares and is net of Net loss (income) attributable to noncontrolling interests. For periods prior to
the Spin-Off, there were no dilutive equity instruments as there were no equity awards of GE Vernova outstanding prior to the Spin-Off. The
dilutive effect of outstanding stock options, restricted stock units, and performance share units is reflected in the denominator for diluted
EPS using the treasury stock method.
(a) Diluted earnings (loss) per share excludes certain shares issuable under share-based compensation plans because the effect would
have been antidilutive.
