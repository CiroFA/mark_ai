Debt and Finance Lease Liabilities
Chevron’s total debt and finance lease liabilities were $29.7 billion at March 31, 2025, up from $24.5 billion at December 31, 2024, as the company issued $5.5 billion in bonds  during first quarter 2025.
The company’s primary source for working capital needs is its commercial paper program. The outstanding balance for the company’s commercial paper program at March 31, 2025, was $5.2 billion, compared with $5.4 billion at December 31, 2024. The company’s debt and finance lease liabilities due within one year, consisting primarily of commercial paper, the current portion of long-term debt and redeemable long-term obligations, totaled $12.3 billion at March 31, 2025, and $12.7 billion at December 31, 2024. Of these amounts, $8.25 billion was reclassified to long-term at both March 31, 2025, and December 31, 2024. At March 31, 2025, settlement of these obligations was not expected to require the use of working capital within one year, as the company had the intent and the ability, as evidenced by committed credit facilities, to continually refinance them.
At March 31, 2025, the company had $8.25 billion in 364-day committed credit facilities with various major banks that enable the refinancing of short-term obligations. The credit facilities allow the company the option to convert outstanding short-term obligations into a term loan for a period of up to one year from the facilities termination date. This supports commercial paper borrowing and can also be used for general corporate purposes. The company’s practice has been to replace expiring commitments with new commitments on substantially the same terms, maintaining levels management believes appropriate. Any borrowings under the facilities would be unsecured indebtedness at interest rates based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR), or an average of base lending rates published by specified banks and on terms reflecting the company’s strong credit rating. No borrowings were outstanding under these facilities at March 31, 2025. In addition, the company has an automatic shelf registration statement that expires in November 2027 for an unspecified amount
