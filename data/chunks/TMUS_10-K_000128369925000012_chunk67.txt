Net Customer Additions
The following table sets forth the number of net customer additions:
(1)    In the second quarter of 2024, we acquired 3,504,000 prepaid customers through the Ka’ena Acquisition, which includes the impact of certain base adjustments to align the policies of Ka’ena and T-Mobile.
(2)    Customers impacted by the decommissioning of the legacy Sprint CDMA and LTE and T-Mobile UMTS networks have been excluded from our customer base resulting in the removal of 212,000 postpaid phone customers and 349,000 postpaid other customers in the first quarter of 2022 and 284,000 postpaid phone customers, 946,000 postpaid other customers and 28,000 prepaid customers in the second quarter of 2022. In the fourth quarter of 2023, we recognized an additional base adjustment to increase postpaid phone customers by 20,000 and increase postpaid other customers by 150,000 due to fewer customers than expected whose service was deactivated as a result of the network shut-downs. In connection with our acquisition of companies, we included a base adjustment in the first quarter of 2022 to increase postpaid phone customers by 17,000 and reduce postpaid other customers by 14,000. Certain customers now serviced through reseller contracts were removed from our reported postpaid customer base resulting in the removal of 42,000 postpaid phone customers and 20,000 postpaid other customers in the second quarter of 2022.
