EPS were negatively affected in 2024, 2023 and 2022 by $1.28, $6.21, and $0.22, respectively, of charges for certain upfront and pre-approval milestone payments related to collaborations and licensing agreements, as well as charges related to pre-approval assets obtained in transactions accounted for as asset acquisitions.
Pricing
Global efforts toward health care cost containment continue to exert pressure on product pricing and market access worldwide. Changes to the U.S. health care system as part of health care reform, as well as increased purchasing power of entities that negotiate on behalf of Medicare, Medicaid, and private sector beneficiaries, have contributed to pricing pressure. In 2021, the U.S. Congress passed the American Rescue Plan Act, which included a provision that eliminated the statutory cap on rebates drug manufacturers pay to Medicaid beginning in January 2024.
As a result of this provision, the Company paid state Medicaid programs more in rebates than it received on Medicaid sales of
Januvia
,
Janumet
and
Janumet
XR in 2024.
In 2022, the U.S. Congress passed the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which made significant changes to how drugs are covered and paid for under the Medicare program, including the creation of financial penalties for drugs whose prices rise faster than the rate of inflation, redesign of the Medicare Part D program to require manufacturers to bear more of the liability for certain drug benefits (which has taken effect in 2025), and government price setting for certain Medicare Part D drugs (starting in 2026) and Medicare Part B drugs (starting in 2028). Government price setting may also impact pricing in the private market negatively affecting the Company’s performance. In 2023, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), through the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), selected
Januvia
for the first year of the IRA’s “Drug Price Negotiation Program” (Program). Pursuant to the IRA’s Program, a government price was set for
Januvia
, which will become effective on January 1, 2026.
In January 2025, the U.S. Department of HHS, through the CMS, announced that
Janumet
and
Janumet
XR would be in included in the second year of the IRA’s Program, with government price setting to become effective on January 1, 2027.
The Company has sued the U.S. government regarding the IRA’s Program (see Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements). Additionally, increased utilization of the 340B Federal Drug Discount Program and restrictions on the Company’s ability to identify inappropriate discounts are having a negative impact on Company performance. Furthermore, the Executive Branch and Congress continue to discuss legislation designed to control health care costs, including the cost of drugs. In several international markets, government-mandated pricing actions have reduced prices of generic and patented drugs. In addition, the Company’s sales performance in 2024 was negatively affected by other
