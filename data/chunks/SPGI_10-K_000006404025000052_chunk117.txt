We have the ability to borrow a total of $
2.0
billion through our commercial paper program, which is supported by our credit facility. As of December 31, 2024  and 2023, we had
no
outstanding commercial paper.
Commitment fees for the unutilized commitments under the credit facility and applicable margins for borrowings thereunder are linked to the Company achieving
three
environmental sustainability performance indicators related to emissions, tested annually. We currently pay a commitment fee of
7

The only financial covenant required under our credit facility is that our indebtedness to cash flow ratio, as defined in our credit facility, was not greater than
4
to 1, and this covenant level has never been exceeded.
