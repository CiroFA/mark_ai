adversely affected if:
•
our contracts with channel participants were terminated or our relationships with channel participants were to deteriorate;
•
any of our competitors enter into strategic relationships with or acquire a significant channel participant;
•
the financial condition or operations of our channel participants were to weaken; or
•
the level of demand for our channel participants’ products and services were to decrease.
There can be no assurance that we will be successful in maintaining, expanding or developing our relationships with channel participants. If we are not successful, we may lose sales opportunities, customers and revenues. In addition, we do not control channel participants, some of which operate in jurisdictions with high levels of corruption, and our compliance policies and procedures may fail to prevent or detect violations of anti-corruption or other laws for which we may be held responsible.
Acquisitions present many risks and we may not achieve the financial and strategic goals that were contemplated at the time of a transaction.
We review and consider strategic acquisitions of companies, products, services and technologies. We have a selective and active acquisition program and we expect to continue to make acquisitions in the future because acquisitions have been an important element of our overall corporate strategy. Risks we may face in connection with our acquisition program include:
•
our ongoing business may be disrupted and our management’s attention may be diverted by acquisition, transition or integration activities;
•
we may have difficulties (1) managing an acquired company’s technologies or lines of business; (2) entering new markets where we have no, or limited, direct prior experience or where competitors may have stronger market positions; or (3) retaining key personnel from the acquired companies;
•
an acquisition may not further our business strategy as we expected, we may not integrate an acquired company or technology as successfully as we expected, we may impose our business practices or alter go-to-market strategies that adversely impact the acquired business or we may overpay for, or otherwise not realize the expected return on our investments, each or all of which could adversely affect our business or operating results and potentially cause impairment to assets that we recorded as a part of an acquisition, including intangible assets and goodwill;
•
our operating results or financial condition may be adversely impacted by (1) claims or liabilities that we assume from an acquired company or technology or that are otherwise related to an acquisition; (2) pre-existing contractual relationships that we assume from an acquired company, the termination or
