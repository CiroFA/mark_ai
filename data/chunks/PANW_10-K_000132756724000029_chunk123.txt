2.0
billion aggregate principal amount of
0.375
% Convertible Senior Notes due 2025 (the “2025 Notes,” and together with the 2023 Notes, the “Notes”). The 2023 Notes bear interest at a fixed rate of
0.75
% per year, payable semi-annually in arrears on January 1 and July 1 of each year, beginning on January 1, 2019. The 2023 Notes were converted prior to or settled on the maturity date of July 1, 2023 in accordance with their terms. The 2025 Notes bear interest at a fixed rate of
0.375
% per year, payable semi-annually in arrears on June 1 and December 1 of each year, beginning on December 1, 2020. The 2025 Notes are governed by an indenture between us, as the issuer, and U.S. Bank National Association, as Trustee (the “Indenture”). The 2025 Notes are unsecured, unsubordinated obligations and the Indenture governing the 2025 Notes does not contain any financial covenants or restrictions on the payments of dividends, the incurrence of indebtedness, or the issuance or repurchase of securities by us or any of our subsidiaries. The 2025 Notes mature on June 1, 2025. We may redeem for cash all or any portion of the 2025 Notes, at our option, on or after June 5, 2023 and prior to the 31st scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date if the last reported sale price of our common stock has been at least
130
% of the conversion price then in effect for at least
20
trading days during any
30
consecutive trading day period ending on and including the trading day preceding the date on which we provide notice of redemption. The redemption will be at a price equal to
100
% of the principal amount of the 2025 Notes and adjusted for interest. If we call any or all of the 2025 Notes for redemption, holders may convert such 2025 Notes called for redemption at any time prior to the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the redemption date.
