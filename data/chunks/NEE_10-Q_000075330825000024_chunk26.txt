cost of building and operating an additional

MW of solar and
596
MW of battery storage projects in 2028 and
1,788
MW of solar and
596
MW of battery storage projects in 2029. The plan also requests a non-cash tax adjustment mechanism, which would operate in a similar manner to the non-cash depreciation reserve surplus mechanisms that were integral to FPL's prior multi-year rate settlements, as well as a storm cost recovery mechanism and a process to address potential tax law changes, which were included in the 2021 rate agreement. Under this proposed four-year rate plan, FPL commits that if its requested base rate adjustments are approved, it will not request additional general base rate increases that would be effective before January 2030. FPL's requested increases are based on a regulatory ROE of
11.90
% on its retail rate base and continuation of FPL's regulatory capital structure, including its longstanding equity ratio approved in prior base rate cases. Accompanying FPL's petition are the testimony and exhibits of FPL's witnesses and the FPSC's required schedules supporting the 2026 and 2027 general base rate increases and charges. Technical hearings on the base rate proceeding are scheduled during the third quarter of 2025 and a final decision is expected in the fourth quarter of 2025.
Restricted Cash
– At March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, NEE had approximately $
131
million ($
40
million for FPL) and $
159
million ($
101
million for FPL), respectively, of restricted cash, which, at December 31, 2024, was offset by $
244
million of cash received on exchange-traded derivative positions resulting in a balance of $(
85
) million. Restricted cash accounts are included in current other assets on NEE's and FPL's condensed consolidated balance sheets and primarily relate to debt service payments and margin cash collateral requirements (funding) at NEER and bond proceeds held for construction at FPL. In addition, where offsetting positions exist, restricted cash related to margin cash collateral of $
123
million is netted against derivative assets and $
6
million is netted against derivative liabilities at March 31, 2025 and $
279
million is netted against derivative assets at December 31, 2024. See Note 2.
Storm Cost Recovery
– In January 2025, FPL began recovering eligible storm costs and replenishment of the storm reserve through a storm surcharge totaling approximately $
1.2
billion, related to Hurricanes Debby, Helene and Milton which impacted FPL's service area in
