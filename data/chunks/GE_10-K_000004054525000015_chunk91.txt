DEFERRED INCOME TAXES.
We have not recorded a provision for the deferred taxes related to the U.S. tax on foreign earnings enacted in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 ("global intangible low tax income"). We also have not provided deferred taxes on cumulative net earnings of non-U.S. affiliates and associated companies of approximately $
10.2
billion that have been reinvested indefinitely. Due to U.S. tax reform, substantially all of our unrepatriated net earnings have been subject to U.S. tax and accordingly we expect to have the ability repatriate available non-U.S. cash without significant additional tax cost. Most of these earnings have been reinvested in active non-U.S. business operations and it is not practicable to determine the income tax liability that would be payable if such earnings were not reinvested indefinitely. We reassess reinvestment of earnings on an ongoing basis. In 2024, 2023 and 2022 in connection with the execution of the Company’s plans to prepare for the spin-off of GE HealthCare and GE Vernova, we incurred
zero
, $
38
million and $
66
million of tax, respectively, due to repatriation of previously reinvested earnings.
