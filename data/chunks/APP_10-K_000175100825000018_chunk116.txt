◦
We performed risk assessment procedures over the valuation assumptions and performed a sensitivity analysis to understand the impacts of the valuation assumptions used.
◦
We tested the accuracy of the data used in measuring the awards by agreeing the underlying inputs, such as the grant date, and the stock price, among others, back to source documents, such as grant agreements.
◦
We evaluated the qualifications of the Company's specialists by assessing their certifications and determining whether they meet the qualifications necessary to perform independent PSU valuations.
◦
With the assistance of our fair value specialists, we evaluated management’s valuation of the PSUs by:
I.
Evaluating the Monte Carlo simulation model methodology and the reasonableness of the valuation assumptions, including the stock price on the date of grant, expected volatility, risk-free interest rate, discount for lack of marketability, and dividend yield.
II.
Independently developing the Monte Carlo simulation model and independently calculating valuation inputs.
