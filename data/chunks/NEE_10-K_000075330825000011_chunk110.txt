Significant Unobservable Inputs Used in Recurring Fair Value Measurements
– The valuation of certain commodity contracts requires the use of significant unobservable inputs. All forward price, implied volatility, implied correlation and interest rate inputs used in the valuation of such contracts are directly based on third-party market data, such as broker quotes and exchange settlements, when that data is available. If third-party market data is not available, then industry standard methodologies are used to develop inputs that maximize the use of relevant observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. Observable inputs, including some forward prices, implied volatilities and interest rates used for determining fair value are updated daily to reflect the best available market information. Unobservable inputs which are related to observable inputs, such as illiquid portions of forward price or volatility curves, are updated daily as well, using industry standard techniques such as interpolation and extrapolation, combining observable forward inputs supplemented by historical market and other relevant data. Other unobservable inputs, such as implied correlations, block-to-hourly price shaping, customer migration rates from full

requirements contracts and some implied volatility curves, are modeled using proprietary models based on historical data and industry standard techniques.
The significant unobservable inputs used in the valuation of NEE's commodity contracts categorized as Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy at December 31, 2024 are as follows:

(a)
Unobservable inputs were weighted by volume.
(b)
Megawatt-hours
(c)
One million British thermal units
(d)
Applies only to full requirements contracts.
The sensitivity of NEE's fair value measurements to increases (decreases) in the significant unobservable inputs is as follows:

The reconciliation of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are based on significant unobservable inputs is as follows:

(a)
Transfers into Level 3 were a result of decreased observability of market data. Transfers from Level 3 to Level 2 were a result of increased observability of market data.
