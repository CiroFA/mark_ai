Agricultural Market Business Cycle –
The agricultural market is affected by various factors including commodity prices, acreage planted, crop yields, and government policies. These factors affect farmers’ income and may result in varying demand for our equipment. In 2024, we experienced unfavorable market
conditions which resulted in lower sales volumes, higher sales incentives, higher receivable write-offs, and an increase in expected credit losses.
We introduced cost reduction measures to manage our profitability and inventory levels. In the third quarter of 2024, we implemented employee-separation programs for our salaried workforce to help meet our strategic priorities while reducing overlap and redundancy in roles and responsibilities. The programs’ total pretax expenses are estimated to be approximately $165, of which $157 was recorded in 2024 (see Note 4). Annual pretax savings from these programs are estimated to be about $220. Approximately $100 of savings was realized in 2024.
Changes in interest rates and the agricultural market business cycle are driven by factors outside of our control, and as a result we cannot reasonably foresee when these conditions will fully subside.

Each equipment operations segment experienced lower shipment volumes partially offset by price realization during 2024. Rising global grain stocks, lower commodity prices, elevated interest rates, and the effect of inventory management contributed to lower shipment volumes for large and small agriculture. Declines in housing starts, decreases in rental purchases, lower levels of commercial real estate construction, and the effect of inventory management contributed to lower shipment volumes for construction equipment.
Production costs were favorable in 2024 due to lower material and employee profit-sharing incentives costs, partially offset by higher manufacturing overhead costs driven by lower volumes and production inefficiencies.

Sales volumes decreased 17 percent in the U.S. and Canada, 40 percent in Brazil, and 30 percent in Europe. Price realization in the U.S. and Canada was 3 percent driven by inflation, which was partially offset by an increase in retail and pool funds sales incentives. Price realization was flat outside the U.S. and Canada
