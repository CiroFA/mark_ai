(a)
The computation of earnings (loss) per share for all periods through
AprilÂ 1, 2024
was calculated using
274 million
common shares that
were issued upon Spin-Off and excludes Net loss (income) attributable to noncontrolling interests. For periods prior to the Spin-Off, the
Company participated in various GE stock-based compensation plans. For periods prior to the Spin-Off, there were no dilutive equity
instruments as there were no equity awards of GE Vernova outstanding prior to Spin-Off.
For the year ended
December 31, 2024
,
operating income (loss) was
$0.5 billion
, a
$1.4 billion
increase, primarily due to: an increase in
segment results at Power of
$0.5 billion
, primarily attributable to Gas Power, where higher volume, favorable pricing, and increased
productivity more than offset the impact of inflation; at Electrification of
$0.4 billion
, primarily due to higher volume, price, and productivity;
at Wind of
$0.4 billion
, primarily at Onshore Wind as a result of improved pricing, market selectivity, and the impact of cost reduction
activities, and a gain recorded on the settlement of a previously canceled project at Offshore Wind, which was partially offset by
incremental contract losses at Offshore Wind; as well as $0.3 billion re
ceived related to an arbitration refund and a $0.1 billion benefit
related to deferred intercompany profit that was recognized upon GE retaining the renewable energy U.S. tax equity investments in
connection with the Spin-Off in the second quarter; partially offset by higher corporate costs required to operate as a stand-alone public
company and separation costs.
Net income (loss) and Net income (loss) margin were
$1.6 billion
and
4.5%
, respectively, for
the
year ended
December 31, 2024
, an
increase of
$2.0 billion
and
5.9%
,
respectively,
for the year, primarily due to an increase in operating income (loss) of
$1.4 billion
and an
increase in other income of
$1.0 billion
,
driven by a
$1.0 billion
pre-tax gain from the sale of a portion of Steam Power nuclear activities to
EDF
,
partially offset by an increase in
provision
for income taxes of
$0.6 billion
.
Adjusted EBITDA* and Adjusted EBITDA margin* were
$2.0 billion
and
5.8%
, respectively, for the
year ended
December 31, 2024
, an
increase
of
$1.2 billion
and
3.4%
, respectively, primarily driven by increases in segment results at Power, Wind, and Electrification.
