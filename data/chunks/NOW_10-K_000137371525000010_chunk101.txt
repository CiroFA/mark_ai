$
68
million and $
51
million of unrecognized tax benefits have been recorded as liabilities as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
We are subject to taxation in the United States and foreign jurisdictions. As of December 31, 2024, our tax years 2004 to 2024 remain subject to examination in most jurisdictions.
Due to differing interpretations of tax laws and regulations, tax authorities may dispute our tax filing positions. We periodically evaluate our exposures associated with our tax filing positions and believe that adequate amounts have been reserved for adjustments that may result from tax examinations.
