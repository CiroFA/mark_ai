recorded to treasury stock on our consolidated balance sheets. Repurchased shares of our common stock are held as treasury shares until they are reissued or retired. When we reissue treasury stock, if the proceeds from the sale are more than the average price we paid to acquire the shares, we record an increase in additional paid-in capital. Conversely, if the proceeds from the sale are less than the average price we paid to acquire the shares, we record a decrease in additional paid-in capital to the extent of increases previously recorded for similar transactions and a decrease in retained earnings for any remaining amount.
In the past, we have satisfied option exercises and restricted stock unit vesting under our employee equity incentive plans by reissuing treasury shares, and we may do so again in the future. For all periods presented, we issued new shares of common stock to satisfy option exercises and RSU vesting under our 2005 Equity Incentive Plan. We have not yet determined the ultimate disposition of the shares that we have repurchased in the past, and consequently we continue to hold them as treasury shares.
During the twelve months ended July 31, 2024, we declared cash dividends that totaled $
3.60
per share of outstanding common stock, or approximately $
1.0
billion. In August 2024, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $
1.04
per share of outstanding common stock payable on October 18, 2024 to stockholders of record at the close of business on October 10, 2024. Future declarations of dividends and the establishment of future record dates and payment dates are subject to the final determination of our Board of Directors.
Our stockholders initially approved our 2005 Equity Incentive Plan (2005 Plan) on December 9, 2004. On January 18, 2024, our stockholders approved an Amended and Restated 2005 Equity Incentive Plan (Restated 2005 Plan) that expires on January 18, 2034. Under the Restated 2005 Plan, we are permitted to grant incentive and non-qualified stock options, restricted stock awards, RSUs, stock appreciation rights, and stock bonus awards to our employees, non-employee directors, and consultants. The Compensation and Organizational Development Comm
ittee of our Board of Directors or its delegates determine who will receive grants, when those grants will be exercisable, their exercise price, and other terms. We are permitted to issue up to
171.7
million shares under the Restated 2005 Plan, including
3,366,512
shares that were previously available for issuance prior to January 20, 2022 under the Credit Karma Plan, described below, adjusted for the fungible ratio of the Restated 2005 Plan. T
he plan provides a fungible share reserve. Each stock option granted on or after November 1, 2010 reduces the share reserve by
one
share and each restricted stock award or restricted stock unit granted reduces the share reserve by
2.3
shares. Stock options forfeited and returned to the pool of shares available for
