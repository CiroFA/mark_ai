Company’s unrecognized tax benefits process, including controls over transfer pricing and certain other intercompany transactions.
We involved tax and transfer pricing professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in:
•
evaluating the Company’s interpretation of tax laws and income tax consequences of intercompany transactions, including internal restructurings and intra-entity transfers of assets;
•
assessing transfer pricing studies for compliance with applicable laws and regulations;
•
analyzing the Company’s tax positions, including the methodology over measurement of unrecognized tax benefits related to transfer pricing;
•
evaluating the Company’s determination of unrecognized tax benefits, including the associated effect in other jurisdictions; and
•
inspecting settlements with applicable taxing authorities.
In addition, we evaluated the Company’s ability to estimate its unrecognized tax benefits by comparing historical unrecognized tax benefits to actual results upon the conclusion of examinations by applicable taxing authorities.
