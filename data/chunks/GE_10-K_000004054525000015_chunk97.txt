these periodic interest settlements are classified as operating activities in the Statement of Cash Flows. Settlements from termination of all qualified hedges are classified in the Statement of Cash Flows following the nature of the hedged items (e.g., investing activities for derivatives used to hedge investments in our foreign operations).
We also use derivatives for economic hedges when we have exposures to currency exchange risk for which we are unable to meet the requirements for hedge accounting or when changes in the carrying amount of the hedged item are already recorded in earnings in the same period as the derivative making hedge accounting unnecessary. Even though the derivative is an effective economic hedge, there may be a net effect on earnings in each period due to differences in the timing of earnings recognition between the derivative and the hedged item.
(a) Gains (losses) on interest settlements related to cross-currency swaps included in our Statement of Earnings (Loss) are $
2
million and $
0
million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
(b) Gains (losses) included in our Statement of Earnings (Loss) are $
105
million and $
136
million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, primarily in SG&A, driven by hedges of deferred incentive compensation and foreign exchange fluctuation. These amounts are offset by the remeasurement of the underlying exposure through earnings.
CASH FLOW HEDGES AND NET INVESTMENT HEDGES
(a) Primarily currency exchange contracts, and recognized in Costs of equipment or services sold in the Statement of Earnings (Loss). We expect to reclassify a $
30
million loss from AOCI to earnings in the next 12 months contemporaneously with the earnings effects of the related forecasted transactions.

5,199
million and $
4,726
million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
FAIR VALUE HEDGES.
We used fair value hedges to hedge the effects of interest rate and currency changes on debt we issued.  All fair value hedges were terminated in 2022 due to exposure management actions. The cumulative net gains related to hedging adjustments of $
1,037
million and $
1,162
million on discontinued hedges were included primarily in
long-term borrowings
of $
8,387
and $
9,253
million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and will continue to amortize into interest expense until the borrowings mature.
COUNTERPARTY CREDIT RISK.
Our exposures to counterparties (including accrued interest) was $
188
and $
241
million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Counterparties' exposures to our derivative liability (including accrued interest), was $
77
