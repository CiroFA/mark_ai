respectively. Gross unrealized losses  at March 31, 2025 included $(
96
) million related to commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) collateralized by pools of commercial mortgage loans on real estate, and $(
57
) million related to asset-backed securities. The majority of our CMBS and asset-backed securities in an unrealized loss position have received investment-grade credit ratings from the major rating agencies. The majority of our U.S. and non-U.S. corporate securities' gross unrealized losses were in the consumer, electric, technology and communication industries. For our securities in an unrealized loss position, the losses are not indicative of credit losses, we currently do not intend to sell the investments, and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the investments before recovery of their amortized cost basis.
Contractual maturities of our debt securities (excluding mortgage and asset-backed securities) at March 31, 2025 are as follows:
We expect actual maturities to differ from contractual maturities because borrowers have the right to call or prepay certain obligations.

4,351
million and $
5,074
million, including the AerCap senior note, are classified within Level 3, as significant inputs to their valuation models are unobservable at March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively. During the three months ended March 31, 2025, $
949
