Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures.
Under the supervision and with the participation of the Company's management,
including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the Company evaluated its disclosure controls and procedures as defined
in Rules 13(a)-15(e) and 15(d)-15(e) under the Exchange Act.
Based on this evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of March 31,
2025
, and that the information
required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized,
and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated
to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure.

reporting occurred during the three months ended March 31, 2025, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect,
the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
