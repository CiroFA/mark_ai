Amgen seeks a judgment from the New Jersey District Court that Celltrion has infringed or will infringe one or more claims of each of the Asserted Patents against Celltrion and based on that judgment, a permanent injunction prohibiting the commercial manufacture, use, offer to sell, or sale within the United States or importation into the United States of Celltrion’s proposed denosumab biosimilar before expiration of each of the Asserted Patents against Celltrion found infringed. Amgen also seeks monetary remedies for any past acts of infringement. Celltrion responded to the complaint on July 11, 2024, denying infringement and asserting affirmative defenses including invalidity and non-infringement. On November 25, 2024, the New Jersey District Court issued a Scheduling Order including a hearing on claim construction scheduled for February 14, 2025 and trial beginning on April 7, 2025. On January 23, 2025, the New Jersey District Court issued a consent judgment and injunction finding the Asserted Patents against Celltrion valid, enforceable and infringed by the Celltrion biosimilar denosumab products in the United States. The injunction prohibits Celltrion, its affiliates and any third party acting on behalf of or in active concert with Celltrion from making using, offering to sell, selling or importing Celltrion’s denosumab biosimilar products into the United States before June 1, 2025, except as specifically authorized by a confidential binding settlement term sheet and 35 U.S.C. 271.
