initial design of these entities and do not have a controlling financial interest in these entities.
Certain subsidiaries of NEE have noncontrolling interests in entities accounted for under the equity method, including NEE's noncontrolling interest in XPLR OpCo (see Note 8). These entities are limited partnerships or similar entity structures in which the limited partners or non-managing members do not have substantive rights over the significant activities of these entities, and therefore are considered VIEs. NEE is not the primary beneficiary because it does not have a controlling financial interest in these entities, and therefore does not consolidate any of these entities. NEE’s investment in these entities totaled approximately $
3,315
million and $
3,913
million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. At December 31, 2024, subsidiaries of NEE had guarantees related to certain obligations of one of these entities, as well as commitments to invest an additional approximately $
175
million in several of these entities. See further discussion of such guarantees and commitments in Note 15 – Commitments and – Contracts, respectively.

Leases
NEE has operating and finance leases primarily related to land use agreements that convey exclusive use of the land during the arrangement for certain of its renewable energy projects and substations, as well as buildings and equipment. Operating and finance leases primarily have fixed payments with expected expiration dates ranging from 2025 to 2083, with the exception of operating leases related to
three
land use agreements with an expiration date of 2106, some of which include options to extend the leases up to
34
years and some have options to terminate at NEE's discretion. At December 31, 2024, NEE’s
ROU assets
and
lease liabilities
for operating leases totaled approximately $
372
million and $
387
million, respectively; the respective amounts at December 31, 2023 were $
396
million and $
412
million. At December 31, 2024, NEE’s
ROU assets
and
lease liabilities
for finance leases totaled approximately $
826
million and $
840
million, respectively; the respective amounts at December 31, 2023 were $
440
million and $
444
million. NEE’s lease liabilities at December 31, 2024 and 2023 were calculated using a weighted-average incremental borrowing rate at the lease inception of
3.83
% and
3.96
%, respectively, for operating leases and
4.92
% and
4.32
%, respectively, for finance leases, and a weighted-average remaining lease term of
44
years and
44
years, respectively, for operating leases and
33
years and
32
years, respectively, for finance leases. At December 31, 2024, expected lease payments over the remaining terms of the leases were approximately $
2.6
billion with no one year being material. Operating and finance lease-related amounts were not material to NEE's consolidated statements of income or cash flows for the periods presented.
NEE has operating and sales-type leases primarily related to
