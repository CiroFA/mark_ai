years. It is reasonably possible that we may incur costs that exceed these recorded amounts because of regulatory agency orders and directives, changes in laws and/or regulations, higher than expected costs and/or the discovery of new or additional contamination. As part of our estimating process, we develop a range of reasonably possible alternate scenarios that includes the high end of a range of reasonably possible cost estimates for all remediation sites for which we have sufficient information based on our experience and existing laws and regulations. There are some potential remediation obligations where the costs of remediation cannot be reasonably estimated. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the high end of the estimated range of reasonably possible remediation costs exceeded our recorded liabilities by $
1,002
and $

Commercial Aircraft Trade-In Commitments
In conjunction with signing definitive agreements for the sale of new aircraft, we have entered into trade-in commitments with certain customers that give them the right to trade in used aircraft at a specified price. The probability that trade-in commitments will be exercised is determined by using both quantitative information from valuation sources and qualitative information from other sources. The probability of exercise is assessed quarterly, or as events trigger a change, and takes into consideration the current economic and airline industry environments. Trade-in commitments, which can be terminated by mutual consent with the customer, may be exercised only during the period specified in the agreement and require advance notice by the customer.
Trade-in commitment agreements at December 31, 2024 have expiration dates from 2025 through 2031. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, total contractual trade-in commitments were $
1,393
and $
1,415
. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we estimated that it was probable we would be obligated to perform on certain of these commitments with net amounts payable to customers totaling $
275
and $
407
, and the fair value of the related trade-in aircraft was $

Financing Commitments
Financing commitments related to aircraft on order, including options and those proposed in sales campaigns, and refinancing of delivered aircraft, totaled $
17,124
and $
17,003
as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.
The estimated earliest potential funding dates for these commitments as of December 31, 2024 are as follows:
As of December 31, 2024, $
13,798
of these financing commitments relate to customers we believe have less than investment-grade credit. We have concluded that no reserve for future potential losses is required for these financing commitments based upon the terms, such as collateralization and interest rates, under which funding would be provided.
