industries or country exposures in order to align with directives or expectations of its banking regulators.
Similarly, challenging economic conditions that affect a particular industry or geographic area could lead to concerns about the credit quality of counterparties, borrowers or other obligors not only in that particular industry or geography but in related or dependent industries, wherever located. These conditions could also heighten concerns about the ability of customers of JPMorganChase’s consumer businesses who live in those areas or work in those affected industries or related or dependent industries to meet their obligations to JPMorganChase. JPMorganChase regularly monitors various segments of its credit and market risk exposures to assess the potential risks of concentration or contagion, but its ability to diversify or hedge its exposure against those risks may be limited.
JPMorganChase’s consumer businesses can also be harmed by an excessive expansion of consumer credit by bank or non-bank competitors. Heightened competition for certain types of consumer loans could prompt industry-wide reactions such as significant reductions in the pricing or margins of those loans or the making of loans to less-creditworthy borrowers. If large numbers of consumers subsequently default on their loans, whether due to weak credit profiles, an economic downturn or other factors, this could impair their ability to repay obligations owed to JPMorganChase and result in higher charge-offs and other credit-related losses. More broadly, widespread defaults on consumer debt could lead to recessionary conditions in the U.S. economy, and JPMorganChase’s consumer businesses may earn lower revenues in such an environment.
If JPMorganChase is unable to reduce positions effectively during a market dislocation, this can increase both the market and credit risks associated with those positions and the level of risk-weighted-assets (“RWA”) that JPMorganChase holds on its
balance sheet. These factors could adversely affect JPMorganChase’s capital position, funding costs and the profitability of its businesses.
Liquidity
JPMorganChase’s ability to operate its businesses could be impaired if its liquidity is constrained.
JPMorganChase’s liquidity can be impacted at any given time as a result of factors such as:
•
market-wide illiquidity or disruption
•
changes in liquidity or capital requirements resulting from changes in laws, rules and regulations, including those in response to economic effects of systemic events
•
actions taken by the U.S. government or by the Federal Reserve to reduce its balance sheet, which may reduce deposits held by JPMorganChase and other financial institutions
•
inability to sell assets, or to sell assets at favorable times or prices
•
default by a CCP or other significant market participant
•
unanticipated outflows of cash or collateral
•
unexpected loss of deposits or higher than anticipated draws on lending-related commitments, and
•
