decreased $1.9 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2025 compared to 2024, primarily driven by lower cash received of $2.2 billion from net settlements between our discontinued operations and businesses in continuing operations related to the establishment of the opening cash balance for our former GE Vernova business in 2024.
Cash used for financing activities of discontinued operations
