million at December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, in consolidated Variable Interest Entities (VIEs). These VIEs are primarily associated with a legacy business in Corporate & Other and have no features that could expose us to losses that would significantly exceed the difference between the consolidated assets and liabilities.

Our investments in unconsolidated VIEs were $
8,131
million and $
6,577
million at December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Of these investments, $
1,280
million and $
1,205
million were owned for U.S. tax equity, comprising equity method investments primarily related to onshore renewable energy projects, at December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. In addition, $
6,665
million and $
5,151
million were owned by our run-off insurance operations, primarily comprised of equity method investments at December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The increase in investments in unconsolidated VIEs in our run-off insurance operations reflects strategic initiatives to invest in higher-yielding asset classes. Our maximum exposure to loss in respect of unconsolidated VIEs is increased by our commitments to make additional investments in these entities described in Note 24.

COMMITMENTS.
As of December 31, 2024, we had total investment commitments of $
3,670
million, of which $
3,539
million are related to investments by our run-off insurance operations in investment securities and other assets. Included within these commitments are obligations to make investments in unconsolidated VIEs of $
3,439
million. We also have unfunded commitments, primarily for U.S. tax equity, of $
631
million. Additionally, we have committed to provide financing assistance of $
2,657
million for future customer acquisitions of aircraft equipped with our engines. We believe there is a low probability of utilization of this financing assistance based on the terms under which the financing would be provided. See Note 23 for further information regarding VIEs.
GUARANTEES. Credit support and indemnification agreements - Continuing Operations.
Following the separation of GE Vernova, we have remaining performance and bank guarantees on behalf of GE Vernova. To support GE Vernova in selling products and services globally, we often entered into contracts on behalf of GE Vernova or issued parent company guarantees or trade finance instruments supporting the performance of what were subsidiary legal entities transacting directly with customers, in addition to providing similar credit support for non-customer related activities of GE Vernova (collectively, "GE Aerospace credit support"). Under the Separation and Distribution Agreement (SDA), GE Vernova is obligated to use reasonable best efforts to replace us as the guarantor on or terminate all such credit support instruments.
