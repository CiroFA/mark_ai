a great place to work for our associates, and improving our communities, which we believe will create long-term, sustainable value for our shareholders.  In fiscal 2024, we continued to execute on our Total Home strategy that was introduced in fiscal 2020, by focusing on serving the professional customer (Pro customer), accelerating our online business, expanding installation services, improving localization efforts and elevating our product assortment.  In December 2024, we updated our Total Home strategy, aligned with the key drivers of home improvement demand, to help our customers solve their home improvement needs with more value and exceptional service.  The five pillars of our Total Home strategy are as follows:
•
We continue to transform our Pro offerings to drive Pro penetration by continuing to enhance our Pro product assortment, investing in inventory of high-volume Pro products, launching our redesigned loyalty program, improving job site delivery capabilities, and rolling out our new Pro extended aisle.
•
We are investing in our omnichannel retail capabilities to accelerate our online business through project design tools and our online product marketplace.
•
We are expanding our installation services to create a high value simplified installation solution, which are provided by our network of independent installers or outsourced to our third-party model that sells, furnishes, and installs both smaller refresh projects and more complex projects.
•
We are creating a loyalty ecosystem that drives brand preference and includes building out our MyLowe’s Rewards infrastructure for both Pro and do-it-yourself (DIY) customers.
•
Finally, we are increasing space productivity by optimizing our assortments and tailoring them to the local markets, and balancing our value-oriented private brands with our national brands.
