U.S. Tax Years 2007-2010
In 2014, the IRS issued a Statutory Notice of Deficiency for Eaton US for the 2007 through 2010 tax years (the 2007-10 Notice), which Eaton US contested in Tax Court. The 2007-10 Notice proposed assessments of $
190
million in additional taxes plus $
72
million in penalties, net of agreed credits and deductions. The proposed assessments pertained to: (i) transfer pricing adjustments for products manufactured in the Company's facilities in Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic and sold to affiliated companies located in the United States, and (ii) the separate proposed assessment noted below. The proposed assessment in the 2007-10 Notice for transfer pricing adjustments has been resolved in Tax Court. Eaton US set its transfer prices for products sold between these affiliates at the same prices that Eaton US sells such products to third parties as required by two successive Advance Pricing Agreements (APAs) Eaton US entered into with the IRS that governed the 2005-2010 tax years. Eaton US has continued to apply the APA pricing methodology for 2011 through the current reporting period. In 2011, the IRS sent a letter to Eaton stating that it was retrospectively canceling the APAs. The issue in Tax Court involved whether the IRS improperly cancelled the APAs. On July 26, 2017, the Tax Court issued a ruling in which it agreed with Eaton US that the IRS must abide by the terms of the APAs for the tax years 2005-2006. On May 24, 2021, the IRS filed a notice to appeal the Tax Court’s ruling to the United States Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals. In July 2022, the Sixth Circuit panel heard oral arguments, and on August 25, 2022, issued a ruling in favor of Eaton US, confirming that the IRS must abide by the terms of the APAs. The Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals ruling for tax years 2005-2006 also resolved the APA cancellation issue for the 2007-2010 years. The ruling on the APA issue did not have a material impact on Eaton’s consolidated financial statements. Eaton and the IRS recognized that the ruling on the enforceability of the APA did not address a secondary issue regarding the transfer pricing for a certain royalty paid from 2006-2010. On November 15, 2023, the IRS also agreed to use the royalty rate reported by Eaton for the 2007-2010 tax years. On October 21, 2024, the IRS confirmed to the Tax Court that the Company was not liable for penalties related to the APA cancellation issue.
The 2007-10 Notice also included a separate proposed
