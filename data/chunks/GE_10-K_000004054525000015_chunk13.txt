DEFENSE & PROPULSION TECHNOLOGIES.
Our results in 2024 reflect domestic and international government defense departmentsâ€™ focus on modernizing and scaling their forces while continuing flight operations, driving services demand. A key underlying driver of our business is government funding, as most of the revenue in Defense & Systems is derived from funding that flows through the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) budget, or equivalent international budgets. National defense budgets grew in the U.S. in the low-single digits and internationally in the mid-single digits in 2024. In March 2024, Congress passed its defense funding bill for fiscal year 2024, which included funding that supports our advanced engine development research, classified programs and product procurement and maintenance in other engine lines.
Additionally, the DoD is focused on advanced combat, enhancing platform capability and groundbreaking technology primarily in classified programs, including support for the next generation T901 turboshaft engine and advanced engine architectures. In June 2024, GE Aerospace delivered two T901-GE-900 engines to Sikorsky for integration and testing aboard a UH-60 Black Hawk as part of the U.S. Army upgrade
