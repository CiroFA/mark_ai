addition, the FAA communicated it will not approve production rate increases beyond 38 per month or additional production lines until
Boeing has complied with required quality and safety standards.
The FAA communicated findings from its investigation in February 2024 and identified multiple instances where Boeing and Spirit failed to comply with manufacturing quality control requirements. In the second quarter of 2024, we submitted a comprehensive safety and quality plan to the FAA to address the issues identified. We also began taking additional actions to improve safety and quality, which include investing in workforce training, simplifying plans and processes, eliminating defects, and enhancing our safety and quality culture.

Prior to the Alaska Airlines accident, we were operating at a production rate of 38 per month. As part of our plan to improve quality and safety and to address the issues identified, we slowed production rates and delayed planned production rate increases to reduce traveled work in our factory, as well as at our suppliers. These actions also include conducting fuselage inspections at Spirit to improve quality prior to shipment to Boeing.
Production was paused on September 13, 2024, because of the work stoppage initiated by IAM 751. A new IAM 751 contract was ratified in November 2024, and production resumed in early December 2024. Prior to the work stoppage, production rates gradually increased in 2024 as we implemented new processes aligned with our safety and quality plan. We plan to gradually increase the production rate.
As of December 31, 2024, we had approximately 55 737-8 aircraft in inventory that were produced prior to 2023, including approximately 40 aircraft for customers in China. We expect to deliver these aircraft in 2025.
We are continuing to work through the certification process of the 737-7 and 737-10 models, which have been delayed, while we work through the engineering solution for the engine anti-ice system for the 737-7 and 737-10 prior to certification of these minor models. As of December 31, 2024, we had approximately 35 737-7 and 737-10 aircraft in inventory. We are following the lead of the FAA as we work through the certification process and the ultimate timing will be determined by the regulators.
The production slow-down, the IAM 751 work stoppage and new agreement, and the timing of minor model certifications have had an adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows during 2024. If we are unable to deliver aircraft and/or increase future production rates, or certify the 737-7 and 737-10 models consistent with our assumptions, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows will continue to be adversely affected.
