noncompliance with all laws and regulations, as well as prudent ethical standards and some contractual obligations. It could also include exposure to litigation (known as legal risk) from all aspects of traditional and non-traditional banking.
Citi seeks to operate with integrity, maintain strong ethical standards and adhere to applicable policies and regulatory and legal requirements. Citi must maintain and execute a proactive Compliance Risk Management (CRM) Framework (as set forth in the CRM Policy) that is designed to
manage compliance risk effectively across Citi, with a view to fundamentally strengthen the compliance risk management culture across the lines of defense taking into account Citi’s risk governance framework and regulatory requirements.
Independent Compliance Risk Management’s (ICRM) primary objectives are to:
•
Drive and embed a culture of compliance and control throughout Citi;
•
Maintain and oversee an integrated CRM Framework that facilitates enterprise-wide compliance with local, national or cross-border laws, rules or regulations, Citi’s internal policies, standards and procedures and relevant standards of conduct;
•
Assess compliance risks and issues across product lines, functions and geographies, supported by globally consistent systems and compliance risk management processes; and
•
Provide compliance risk data aggregation and reporting capabilities.
Citi carries out its objectives and fulfills its responsibilities through the CRM Framework, which is composed of the following integrated key activities, to holistically manage compliance risk:
•
Management of Citi’s compliance with laws, rules and regulations by identifying and analyzing changes, assessing the impact and implementing appropriate policies, processes and controls;
•
Developing and providing compliance training to ensure employees are aware of and understand the key laws, rules and regulations;
•
Monitoring the Compliance Risk Appetite, which is articulated through qualitative compliance risk statements describing Citi’s appetite for certain types of risk and quantitative measures to monitor the Company’s compliance risk exposure;
•
Executing Compliance Risk Assessments, the results of which inform Compliance Risk Monitoring and testing of compliance risks and controls in assessing conformance with laws, rules, regulations and internal policies; and
•
Issue identification, escalation and remediation to drive accountability, including measurement and reporting of compliance risk metrics against established thresholds in support of the CRM Policy and Compliance Risk Appetite.
To anticipate, control and mitigate compliance risk, Citi has established the CRM Policy to achieve standardization and centralization of methodologies and processes, and to enable more consistent and comprehensive execution of compliance risk management.
Citi has a commitment, as well as an obligation, to identify, assess and mitigate compliance risks associated with its businesses and
