deliver, target, or measure the effectiveness of ads; by imposing fees or other charges related to our applications or our delivery of ads; by making access to our products more difficult or impossible; by making it more difficult to communicate with our users; by limiting the ability of our devices or products to interoperate with their popular platforms or products; or by integrating competing platforms, applications, or features into products they control such as mobile device operating systems, search engines, browsers, or e-commerce platforms. For example, each of Apple and Google have integrated competitive products with iOS and Android, respectively. In addition, Apple has released changes to iOS that limit our ability, and the ability of others in the digital advertising industry, to target and measure ads effectively. As a result, our competitors may, and in some cases will, acquire and engage users or generate advertising or other revenue at the expense of our own efforts, which would negatively affect our business and financial results. In addition, from time to time, we may take actions in response to competitive threats, but we cannot assure you that these actions will be successful or that they will not negatively affect our business and financial results.
We believe that our ability to compete effectively depends upon many factors both within and beyond our control, including:
•
the popularity, usefulness, ease of use, performance, and reliability of our products compared to our competitors' products;
•
the size and composition of our user base;
•
the engagement of users with our products and competing products;
•
our ability to attract and retain businesses who use our free or paid business and advertising services;
•
the timing and market acceptance of products, including developments and enhancements to our or our competitors' products;
•
our safety and security efforts and our ability to protect user data and to provide users with control over their data;
•
our ability to distribute our products to new and existing users;
•
our ability to monetize our products;
•
the frequency, size, format, quality, and relative prominence of the ads displayed by us or our competitors;
