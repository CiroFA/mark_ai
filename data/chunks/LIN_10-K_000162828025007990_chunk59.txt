The company is currently under audit in a number of jurisdictions. As a result, it is reasonably possible that some of these matters will conclude or reach the stage where a change in unrecognized income tax benefits may occur within the next twelve months. At the time new information becomes available, the company will record any adjustment to income tax expense as required. Final determinations, if any, are not expected to be material to the consolidated financial statements. The company is also subject to income taxes in many hundreds of state and local taxing jurisdictions that are open to tax examinations.

Receivables
Linde applies loss rates that are lifetime expected credit losses at initial recognition of the receivables.  These expected loss rates are based on an analysis of the actual historical default rates for each business, taking regional circumstances into account. If necessary, these historical default rates are adjusted to reflect the impact of current changes in the macroeconomic environment using forward-looking information. The loss rates are also evaluated based on the expectations of the responsible management team regarding the collectability of the receivables. Gross trade receivables aged less than one year were $
4,573
million and $
4,667
million at December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023,
