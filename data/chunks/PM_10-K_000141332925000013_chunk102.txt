modified exposure claim in the United States. These renewal requests were received by the FDA 360 days prior to the stated July 2024 expiration date of the original exposure modification orders, as requested by the FDA in the original orders. On May 9, 2024, the FDA filed for scientific review of our MRTP renewal applications for
IQOS
products and posted materials from these applications. As our applications proceed through the review process, we have responded to FDA requests for additional information. The FDA may make further information requests or conduct subsequent inspections to verify the information we submitted. The FDA did not issue a decision on our MRTP renewal applications prior to the stated July 7, 2024, expiration date of the original exposure modification orders. The MRTP renewal applications were timely filed in accordance with FDA direction, and we believe that we should be permitted to continue to use the modified exposure claim with respect to those products that received exposure modification orders until the FDA decides on our MRTP renewal applications.
On October 20, 2023, we submitted bundled PMTAs for our
IQOS ILUMA
THS products together with MRTPAs requesting authorization of the exposure reduction marketing order previously granted for
IQOS
blade versions. We submitted these applications at the same time in order for the FDA to evaluate the PMTAs and MRTPAs concurrently. In March 2024, the FDA formally accepted our bundled PMTAs and MRTPAs. As our applications proceed through the review process, the FDA may request additional information or conduct subsequent inspections to verify the information we submitted.
On January 19, 2024, the FDA completed its review of our Requests for Exemption from Substantial Equivalence (the “EX REQs”) for the five submitted
IQOS
consumables and determined that these tobacco products were exempt from the requirements outlined for substantial equivalence (a regulatory pathway that can be used to introduce new tobacco products which have the same characteristics as a product previously authorized by the FDA). These submissions were made in November 2022 (for the three initial
IQOS
consumables) and February 2023 (for the two new
IQOS
consumables) to enable domestic manufacturing of
IQOS
consumables utilizing materials purchased from vendors operating in the United States.
On April 29, 2024, we submitted the Annual Report for the
IQOS
Tobacco Heating System ("THS") to the FDA. The report included a systematic review of the literature covering publications related to the
IQOS
THS between March 1, 2023, and February 29, 2024. The report included publications in various scientific fields including aerosol chemistry and physics, standard and systems toxicology, clinical studies on exposure reduction to HPHCs, and observational studies. Overall, the review continues to support the finding that
IQOS
THS is "appropriate for the promotion of public health."
