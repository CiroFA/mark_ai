the book minimum tax will depend on our facts in each year and final guidance from the U.S. Department of the Treasury.
The OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) has proposed a global minimum tax of 15% of reported profits (Pillar 2) that has been agreed upon in principle by over 140 countries. During 2023, many countries took steps to incorporate Pillar 2 model rule concepts into their domestic laws. Although the model rules provide a framework for applying the minimum tax, countries may enact Pillar 2 slightly differently than the model rules and on different timelines and may adjust domestic tax incentives in response to Pillar 2. In addition, in January 2025, the United States issued an executive order announcing opposition to aspects of these rules. Accordingly, we are still evaluating the potential consequences of Pillar 2 on our longer-term financial position. During 2024, we have incurred insignificant tax expenses in connection with Pillar 2.
