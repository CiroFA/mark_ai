Cybersecurity Strategy and Risk Management
Cybersecurity is critical to advancing our overall objectives and enabling our digital efforts. As a global company, we face a wide variety of cybersecurity threats that range from common attacks such as ransomware and denial-of-service, to attacks from more advanced adversaries. Our customers, suppliers, and other partners face similar cybersecurity threats, and a cybersecurity incident impacting these entities could materially adversely affect our operations, performance and results. These cybersecurity threats and related risks make it imperative that we maintain focus on cybersecurity and systemic risks.

We partner with third parties to support and evaluate our cybersecurity program.  These third-party services span areas including cybersecurity maturity assessments, incident response, penetration testing, consulting on best practices, and others.  We also consume threat intelligence from several paid and non-paid sources.
We maintain a 24 x 7 operations center which serves as a central location for the reporting of cybersecurity matters, provides monitoring of our global cybersecurity environment, and coordinates the investigation and remediation of alerts.

In the event of an incident, the cybersecurity team assesses, among other factors, safety impact, supply chain and manufacturing disruption, data and personal information loss, business operations disruption, projected cost and potential for reputational harm, with participation from technical, legal and law enforcement support, as appropriate.
We have implemented a cybersecurity awareness program which covers topics such as phishing, social
