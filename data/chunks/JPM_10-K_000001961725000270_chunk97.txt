national bodies and governmental agencies outside the U.S. have adopted laws, rules or regulations that may conflict with or prohibit JPMorganChase from complying with laws, rules and regulations to which it is otherwise subject, creating conflict of law issues that also increase its risk of non-compliance in those jurisdictions.
Legislative and regulatory initiatives outside the U.S. have required and could in the future require JPMorganChase to make significant modifications to its operations and legal entity structure in the relevant countries or regions in order to comply with those requirements. These include laws, rules and regulations that have been adopted or proposed, as well as regulatory expectations, relating to:
•
the establishment of locally-based intermediate holding companies or operating subsidiaries
•
requirements to maintain minimum amounts of capital or liquidity in locally-based subsidiaries
•

incur higher operational and compliance costs
•
change the prices that it charges for its products and services
•
curtail the products and services that it offers to its customers and clients
•
curtail other business opportunities, including acquisitions or principal investments, that it otherwise would have pursued
•
become subject to regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions, or
•
incur higher costs for complying with different legal and regulatory frameworks.
Any or all of these factors could harm JPMorganChase’s ability to compete against other firms that are not subject to the same laws, rules and regulations or supervisory oversight, or harm JPMorganChase’s businesses, results of operations and profitability.
Resolving regulatory investigations can subject JPMorganChase to significant penalties and collateral consequences, and could result in higher compliance costs or restrictions on its operations.
