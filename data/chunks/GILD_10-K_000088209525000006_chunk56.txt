to $1.3 billion in 2024, compared to 2023, primarily due to higher demand across all regions.
Gross-to-Net Deductions
A substantial portion of our product sales is subject to significant discounts from list price, including government and commercial rebates and chargebacks, as well as other deductions, including patient co-pay assistance, cash discounts for prompt payment, distributor fees, and sales return provisions. These deductions to product sales are generally referred to as gross-to-net deductions and are primarily a function of product sales volume, product mix, contractual or statutory discounts and estimated payer mix.
Rebates and chargebacks are based on contractual arrangements or statutory requirements and include amounts due to payers and healthcare providers under various programs. These amounts may vary by product, payer and individual plans. Providers qualified under certain programs can purchase our products through wholesalers or other distributors at a discount. The wholesalers or distributors then charge the discount back to us.
Other gross-to-net deductions include patient co-pay assistance, cash discounts for prompt payment, distributor fees that we pay under our inventory management agreements with our significant U.S. wholesalers and are based on contractually-determined fixed percentage of sales, and sales return provisions.
Our gross-to-net deductions totaled $17.8 billion, or 38%, of gross product sales in 2024, compared to $16.4 billion, or 38%, of gross product sales in 2023. Of the $17.8 billion in 2024, $15.5 billion, or 33%, of gross product sales was related to rebates and chargebacks, and $2.3 billion, or 5%, was related to other gross-to-net deductions. Of the $16.4 billion in 2023, $14.3 billion, or 33%, of gross product sales was related to rebates and chargebacks, and $2.2 billion, or 5%, was related to other gross-to-net deductions.
Current year gross-to-net deductions as a percent of gross product sales may not be indicative of future results.
Foreign Currency Exchange Impact
We generally face exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily in the Euro. We use foreign currency exchange contracts to hedge a portion of our foreign currency exposures.
Approximately 27% and 26% of our product sales were denominated in foreign currencies during 2024 and 2023, respectively. Foreign currency exchange, net of hedges, had an unfavorable impact on our total product sales of $163 million in 2024, based on a comparison using foreign currency exchange rates from 2023.

Product Gross Margin
Product gross margin increased to 78.2% in 2024, compared to 2023, primarily due to prior year restructuring expenses related to changes in our manufacturing strategy, which resulted in write-offs of certain manufacturing facilities, related inventories and
