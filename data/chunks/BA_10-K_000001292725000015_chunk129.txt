Earnings in Equity Method Investments
During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, our share of income from equity method investments was $
104
, $
70
, and $
56
, respectively. In 2024 and 2023, earnings in equity method investments were primarily driven by investments held at our BDS segment. In 2022, earnings in equity method investments were primarily driven by investments held in Unallocated items, eliminations and other.
Backlog
Our total backlog includes contracts that we and our customers are committed to perform. The value in backlog represents the estimated transaction prices on performance obligations to our customers for which work remains to be performed. Backlog is converted into revenue, primarily based on the cost incurred or at delivery and acceptance of products, depending on the applicable revenue recognition model.
Our backlog at December 31, 2024 was $
521,336
. We expect approximately
14
% to be converted to revenue through 2025 and approximately
59
% through 2028, with the remainder thereafter. There is significant uncertainty regarding the timing of when backlog will convert into revenue. We may experience reductions to backlog and/or significant order cancellations due to various factors including delivery delays, production disruptions and delays to entry into service of the 777X, 737-7 and/or 737-10.
