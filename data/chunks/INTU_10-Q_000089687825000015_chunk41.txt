lenders providing for a $1.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility that expires on February 5, 2029 (2024 Credit Facility).
Under the 2024 Credit Facility, we may, subject to certain customary conditions, including approval of relevant lenders, on one or more occasions, increase commitments under the 2024 Credit Facility by an amount not to exceed $1 billion in the aggregate, and, on one or more occasions, extend the maturity date of the 2024 Credit Facility by one year. The 2024 Credit Facility includes a $500 million sublimit for borrowing swingline loans and a $250 million sublimit for the issuance of letters of credit. Advances under the 2024 Credit Facility accrue interest at rates equal to (a) in the case of U.S. dollar borrowings, at our election, either (i) the alternate base rate plus a margin that ranges from
0.0%
to 0.125%, or (ii) the adjusted term Secured Overnight Finance Rate (SOFR) plus a margin that ranges from 0.7% to 1.125%, or (b) in the case of foreign currency borrowings, the interest benchmark for the relevant currency specified in the credit agreement plus a margin that ranges from 0.7% to 1.125%. Actual margins under either election are based on our senior debt credit ratings.
The 2024 Credit Facility includes customary affirmative and negative covenants, including a financial covenant that requires us to maintain a ratio of total gross debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), as defined in the agreement, of not greater than 4.00 to 1.00 as measured on a rolling twelve month basis as of the last day of each fiscal quarter. As of January 31, 2025, we were compliant with all covenants governing the 2024 Credit Facility. At January 31, 2025, no amounts were outstanding under the 2024 Credit Facility.
On January 30, 2025, we entered into a credit agreement with certain lenders providing for a $4.5 billion unsecured short-term revolving credit facility that matures on April 30, 2025 to fund a portion of our TurboTax 5-day early refund offering.
Advances under the 2025 Credit Facility accrue interest at a rate equal to, at our election, either (i) the alternate base rate plus a margin of 0.125%, or (ii) the adjusted daily simple SOFR or term SOFR plus a margin of 1.125%. Unused portions of the commitment accrue a fee of 0.10% per annum.
The 2025 Credit Facility includes customary affirmative and negative covenants, including a financial covenant that requires us to maintain a ratio of total gross debt to EBITDA, as defined in the agreement, of not greater than 4.00 to 1.00 as measured on a rolling twelve month basis as of the last day of each fiscal quarter.
