Government contracts are subject to heightened reputational and contractual risks compared to contracts with commercial clients. For example, government contracts and the proceedings surrounding them are often subject to more extensive scrutiny and publicity. Negative publicity, including an allegation of improper or illegal activity, regardless of its accuracy, may adversely affect our reputation.

Elections, changes in government or political developments, including government closures or shutdowns, budget deficits, shortfalls or uncertainties, government spending reductions or other debt constraints have resulted and could in the future result in our projects being reduced in price or scope, delayed or terminated altogether, which also could limit our recovery of incurred costs, reimbursable expenses and profits on work completed prior to the termination. Furthermore, if insufficient funding is appropriated to the government entity to cover termination costs, we may not be able to fully recover our investments.

The new U.S. administration has begun efforts to reduce federal spending and the size of the federal workforce under the guidance of the Department of Government Efficiency. As a result of these efforts, many new procurements have been delayed or canceled. In addition, the General Services Administration (GSA) – the U.S. federal procurement agency – has instructed all federal agencies to review their contracts with what it has identified as the 10 highest-paid consulting firms contracting with the U.S. federal government, which includes Accenture Federal Services. The agencies were directed to identify the contracts that they plan to maintain and those that are not “mission critical and provide substantive, imperative technical support,” which will be terminated. These and similar spending reductions and contract reviews have resulted in and are likely to continue to result in contract terminations, delays in new procurements, and reductions in price and contract scope, all of which could have a material impact on Accenture Federal Services’ results of operations and
