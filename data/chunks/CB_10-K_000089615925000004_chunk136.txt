investments over which Chubb cannot exercise significant influence, generally, when we own less than three percent of the investee's shares, are accounted for as follows:
•
Income and expenses from these funds are reported within Net investment income.
•
These funds are carried at net asset value, which approximates fair value with changes in fair value recorded in Net realized gains (losses) on the Consolidated statements of operations. Refer to Note 4 for a further discussion on net asset value.
•
As a result of the timing of the receipt of valuation data from the investment managers, these investments are generally reported on a three-month lag.
•
Sales of these investments are reported within Net realized gains (losses).

Chubb Limited and Subsidiaries
Partially-owned investment companies
Partially-owned investment companies are limited partnerships where our ownership interest is in excess of three percent and are accounted for under the equity method because Chubb exerts significant influence. These investments apply investment company accounting to determine operating results, and Chubb retains the investment company accounting in applying the equity method.
•
This means that investment income, realized gains or losses, and unrealized gains or losses are included in the portion of equity earnings reflected in Other (income) expense.
•
As a result of the timing of the receipt of valuation data from the investment managers, these investments are generally reported on a three-month lag.
Other investments
•
Huatai’s asset management businesses create investment entities known as consolidated investment products which include mutual funds with primary holdings in fixed maturities. These securities are reported at fair value with changes in fair value reported through the Consolidated statements of operations within Net realized gains (losses) as required under investment company accounting standards.
•
Fixed maturities supporting certain participating policy liabilities principally relate to the Huatai investment portfolio. These investments are reported at fair value with changes in fair value recorded through Net realized gains (losses) on the Consolidated statements of operations. We have elected to account for these investments using the fair value option so that changes in fair value of the fixed maturities are recorded in Net realized gains (losses), as opposed to a component within AOCI, to offset corresponding changes in policyholder liabilities within Policy benefits.
•
Policy loans are carried at outstanding balance and interest income is reflected in Net investment income.
•
Life insurance policies are carried at policy cash surrender value and income is reflected in Other (income) expense.
•
Non-qualified separate account assets are supported by assets that do not qualify for separate account reporting under U.S. GAAP and are carried at fair value.
