postretirement plans for the three months ended March 31 are as follows:
Net periodic benefit cost related to our postretirement plans reflected in the table above was not material for the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024.
As discussed in our Form 10-K, we changed certain discount rate assumptions for our retirement and postretirement plans and our expected return on assets assumption for our retirement plans which became effective on January 1, 2025. The effect of the assumption changes on retirement and postretirement expense for the three months ended March 31, 2025 did not have a material impact to our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
In the first three months of 2025, we contributed $
3
million to our retirement plans and expect to make additional required contributions of approximately $
8
million to our retirement plans during the remainder of the year. We may elect to make additional non-required contributions depending on investment performance or any potential deterioration of our pension plan status in the remaining nine months of 2025.

Stock Repurchases
On June 22, 2022, the Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing the purchase of
