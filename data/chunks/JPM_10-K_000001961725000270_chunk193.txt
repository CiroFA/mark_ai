Corporate, the period-end and average deposit balances as of and for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023.
(a)
In the fourth quarter of 2023, CCB transferred certain deposits associated with First Republic to AWM and CIB.
The Firm believes that deposits provide a stable source of funding and reduce the Firm’s reliance on the wholesale funding markets. A significant portion of the Firm’s deposits are consumer deposits and wholesale operating deposits, which are both considered to be stable sources of liquidity. Wholesale operating deposits are generally considered to be stable sources of liquidity because they are generated from customers that maintain operating service relationships with the Firm.
The Firm believes that average deposit balances are generally more representative of deposit trends than period-end deposit balances. However, during periods of market disruption, average deposit trends may be impacted.
The following discussion excludes the impact of the transfer of certain First Republic deposits in the fourth quarter of 2023 from CCB to the other LOBs as the transfers had no net impact on Firmwide deposits.
Average deposits
increased
for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023, reflecting:
•
an increase in CIB due to net inflows predominantly in Payments and net issuances of structured notes as a result of client demand in Markets, partially offset by deposit attrition, which included actions taken to reduce certain deposits,
•
the timing impact of First Republic,
•
an increase in AWM as a result of growth in balances in new and existing client accounts, reflecting the impact of higher-yielding product offerings, largely offset by continued migration into other investments, and
•
a decline in CCB primarily driven by a decrease in balances in existing accounts due to increased customer spending, largely offset by new accounts.
Period-end deposits
increased from December 31, 2023, reflecting:
•
an increase in CIB due to net inflows predominantly in Payments, largely offset by net maturities of structured notes in Markets,
•
an increase in AWM as a result of growth in balances in new and existing client accounts, reflecting the impact of higher-yielding product offerings, largely offset by continued migration into other investments, and
•
a decline in CCB primarily driven by a decrease in balances in existing accounts due to increased customer spending and migration into higher-yielding investments, predominantly offset by new accounts.
