examination for fiscal years 2015 through 2023. The IRS is currently examining our U.S. federal income tax returns for fiscal years 2016 through 2021. There are also ongoing U.S. state and local audits and other foreign audits covering fiscal years 2013 through 2022. We do not expect the results from any ongoing income tax audit to have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.
Over the next twelve months, it is reasonably possible that the resolution of federal and state tax examinations, as well as the expiration of statutes of limitations, could reduce our unrecognized tax benefits by a
n immaterial amount. We do not anticipate the resolution of these matters will result in a material change to our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.
Unrecognized Tax Benefits
The following table reconciles the beginning and ending amount of our gross unrecognized tax benefits:
Unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would affect our annual effective income tax rate on net earnings were $
509
million, $
568
million, and $
537
million at February 2, 2025, January 28, 2024, and January 29, 2023, respectively.
Interest and Penalties
Interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions recognized in the consolidated statements of earnings were immaterial in fiscal 2024, fiscal 2023, and fiscal 2022. Our total accrued interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions were immaterial as of February 2, 2025 and January 28, 2024.
Other
In fiscal 2024, the IRS provided automatic income tax relief to taxpayers in certain southeastern states, extending the timeline to make certain tax payments. As a result, our fourth quarter fiscal 2024 estimated federal tax payment has been deferred to the first quarter of fiscal 2025, which reduced our cash paid for income taxes during fiscal 2024 and increased income taxes payable at February 2, 2025.

Share Repurchases
In August 2023, our Board approved a $
15.0
billion share repurchase authorization that replaced the previous authorization of $
15.0
billion, which was approved in August 2022. The August 2023 authorization does not have a prescribed expiration date. As of February 2, 2025, approximately $
11.7
billion of the $
15.0
billion share repurchase authorization remained available. In March 2024, we paused share repurchases in anticipation of the SRS acquisition (see
Note 13

The following table presents information about our repurchases of common stock, all of which were completed through open market purchases:
