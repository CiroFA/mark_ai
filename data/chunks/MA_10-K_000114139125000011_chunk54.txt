Our Class A common stock trades on the New York Stock Exchang
e under the symbol “MA”.  At February 7, 2025, we had 67 stockholders of record for our Class A common stock.  We believe that the number of beneficial owners is substantially greater than the number of record holders because a large portion of our Class A common stock is held in “street name” by brokers.
There is currently no established public trading market for our Class B common stock.  There were approximately 214 holders of record of our non-voting Class B common stock as of February 7, 2025, constituting approximately 0.7% of our total outstanding equity.
