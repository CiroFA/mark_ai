Management’s Discussion and Analysis
Manufacturing, Service and Retailing
2024 versus 2023
Pilot’s revenues declined $9.9 billion (17.4%) in 2024 compared to the full year 2023. The decline was primarily attributable to lower average fuel prices and a decline in volumes from non-core fuel activities.
Pilot’s pre-tax earnings declined $442 million (41.9%) in 2024 compared to the full year 2023. Gross sales margins declined 4.3% in 2024 compared to the full year 2023, attributable to lower diesel margins from lower price volatility. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 10.3% in 2024 compared to the full year 2023, reflecting increased depreciation and amortization expenses, as well as labor, marketing and maintenance costs. Interest expense declined 30.9% in 2024 compared to the full year 2023, attributable to reduced borrowings and lower rates. In March 2024, Pilot borrowed $5.7 billion from certain Berkshire insurance subsidiaries and repaid its third-party borrowings. Pilot subsequently repaid $1.0 billion of the affiliate borrowings in 2024. The interest on Pilot’s borrowings from affiliates is included in insurance investment income on page K-39.
McLane
McLane Company, Inc. (“McLane”) operates a wholesale distribution business that provides grocery and non-food consumer products to retailers and convenience stores (“retail”) and to restaurants (“restaurant”).

These businesses have several significant customers and a reduction in purchasing by any of these customers could have an adverse impact on McLane’s revenues and earnings.
2024 versus 2023
Revenues declined 1.3% in 2024 compared to 2023, reflecting lower restaurant business sales (5.7%) and increased retail business sales (1.0%) in 2024 compared to 2023. The decline in restaurant sales reflected lower unit sales attributable to changing consumer preferences for dining at restaurants and quick-service restaurants versus meals-at-home, partially offset by impacts of price inflation. Pre-tax earnings increased $179 million (39.3%) in 2024 compared to 2023 reflecting an increase in gross sales margin rates, which more than offset the impacts of lower sales and
