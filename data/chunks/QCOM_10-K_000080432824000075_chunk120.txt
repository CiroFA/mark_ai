Employee Benefit Plans
Equity Compensation Plans.
On March 5, 2024, our stockholders approved the Amended and Restated Qualcomm Incorporated 2023 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the 2023 Plan), including an increase in the share reserve by
15
million shares. The 2023 Plan provides for the grant of RSUs and other stock-based awards. The RSUs generally include dividend-equivalent rights and vest over
three years
from the date of grant. The Board of Directors may amend or terminate the 2023 Plan at any time. Certain amendments, including an increase in the share reserve, require stockholder approval. At September 29, 2024, approximately
75
million shares were available for future grant under the 2023 Plan.
The following is a summary of employee RSU transactions that contain only service requirements to vest:
The weighted-average estimated grant date fair values of employee RSUs that contain only service requirements to vest granted during fiscal 2023 and 2022 were $
116.80
and $
136.09
per share, respectively. Upon vesting, we issue new shares of common stock. For the majority of RSUs, shares are issued on the vesting dates net of the amount of shares needed to satisfy statutory tax withholding requirements to be paid by us on behalf of the employees. As a result, the actual number of shares issued will be fewer than the number of RSUs outstanding. The annual pre-vest forfeiture rate for RSUs was estimated to be approximately
6
