Share-based compensation
Chubb has share-based compensation plans which currently provide the Board the ability to grant awards of stock options, restricted stock, and restricted stock units to its employees and members of the Board.
In May 2021, our shareholders approved the Chubb Limited 2016 Long-Term Incentive Plan, as amended and restated (the Amended 2016 LTIP). Under the Amended 2016 LTIP, Common Shares of Chubb are authorized to be issued pursuant to awards, including incentive and non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, performance shares, performance stock units, restricted stock, and restricted stock units. Under the Chubb Deferred Stock Unit Plan, a sub-plan of the Amended 2016 LTIP, eligible participants may defer vested performance stock units and restricted stock units to the extent such awards are U.S.-allocated compensation.
Chubb principally issues restricted stock grants and stock options on a graded vesting schedule, with equal percentages of the award subject to vesting over a number of years (typically three or four). Chubb recognizes compensation cost for vesting of restricted stock and stock option grants with only service conditions on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for each separately vesting portion of the award as if the award were, in-substance, multiple awards. We incorporate an estimate of future forfeitures in determining compensation cost for both grants of restricted stock and stock options.
In addition, Chubb grants performance-based restricted stock as performance shares and performance stock units to certain executives that vest based on certain performance criteria as compared to a defined group of peer companies. Performance shares and performance stock units comprise both target and premium awards that cliff vest at the end of a
3
-year performance period based on both Chubb tangible book value (Chubb shareholders' equity less goodwill and intangible assets attributable to Chubb, net of tax) per share growth and P&C combined ratio compared to a defined group of peer companies. Premium awards are subject to an additional vesting provision based on total shareholder return (TSR) compared to the peer group. Performance shares
