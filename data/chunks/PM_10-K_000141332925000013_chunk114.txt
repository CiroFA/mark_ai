the above-mentioned sectors. Export to Russia of certain luxury goods, and goods and technology which might contribute to Russia’s technological enhancement was banned. Seven non-EU countries (Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein, North Macedonia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, and Albania) announced that they “aligned themselves” with the majority of the EU sanctions. The U.S., the EU, Switzerland and Japan introduced additional trade restrictions banning, among many other goods, the export of certain non-tobacco materials used to produce cigarettes and heated tobacco consumables in Russia. The EU, Switzerland and the U.K. also prohibited technical assistance and other services related to restricted goods.

The EU and Switzerland prohibited transfer and licensing of intellectual property rights in relation to restricted goods. Additionally, the EU, the U.S., the U.K., Switzerland, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Ukraine imposed sanctions on Mr. Igor Kesaev, a non-majority shareholder of Megapolis Distribution B.V.
The U.S., the U.K., Switzerland and the EU banned the export of electric accumulators, static converters and electronic cigarettes and similar personal electric vaporizing devices, including

PMI continues to monitor the development of new sanctions and ensure full compliance.
