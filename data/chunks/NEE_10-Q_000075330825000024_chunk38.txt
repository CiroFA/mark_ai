increased $299 million primarily due to:
•
the impact of non-qualifying commodity hedges due primarily to changes in energy prices (approximately $188 million of gains for the three months ended March 31, 2025 compared to $51 million of gains for the comparable period in 2024);
•
revenues from new investments of $107 million; and
•
net increases in revenues of $74 million from the customer supply business.
Operating Expenses – net
Operating expenses – net for the three months ended March 31, 2025 increased $122 million primarily due to increases of $92 million in depreciation and amortization and $33 million in fuel, purchased power and interchange expenses, partly offset by a decrease of $33 million in O&M expenses. The increase in depreciation and amortization was primarily associated with new investments as well as higher depletion related to natural gas and oil production.
Interest Expense
NEER’s interest expense for the three months ended March 31, 2025 increased $375 million reflecting approximately $210 million of unfavorable impacts related to changes in the fair value of interest rate derivative instruments as well as higher average debt balances.
Equity in Earnings (Losses) of Equity Method Investees
NEER recognized $646 million of equity in losses of equity method investees for the three months ended March 31, 2025, compared to $183 million of equity in earnings of equity method investees for the three months ended March 31, 2024. The change for the three months ended March 31, 2025 primarily reflects losses related to the investment in XPLR including an impairment charge of approximately $0.7 billion ($0.5 billion after tax) (see Note 3 – Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements), partly offset by higher net earnings of approximately $87 million related to NEER's other equity method investments.

During the three months ended March 31, 2025, renewable energy tax credits increased by approximately $199 million reflecting growth in NEER's business. See Note 4.
