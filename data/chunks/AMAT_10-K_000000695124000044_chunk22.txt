certain parts or components from suppliers on a timely basis or at all, our business, results of operations and customer relationships could be adversely impacted.
If we need to rapidly increase our business and manufacturing capacity to meet increases in demand or expedited shipment schedules, this may strain our manufacturing and supply chain operations, and negatively impact our working capital. If we are unable to accurately forecast demand for our products, we may purchase more or fewer parts than necessary or incur costs for canceling, postponing or expediting delivery of parts. If we purchase or commit to purchase inventory in anticipation of customer demand that does not materialize, or such inventory is rendered obsolete by the rapid pace of technological change, or if customers reduce, delay or cancel orders, we may incur excess or obsolete inventory charges.
We are exposed to various factors that impact the industries in which we operate.
The global semiconductor, display and related industries are characterized by factors that impact demand for and the profitability of our products and services and our operating results, including:
•
the nature, timing and degree of visibility of changes in demand for semiconductor chips and electronic devices, including those related to fluctuations in consumer buying patterns tied to general economic or geopolitical conditions, seasonality or the introduction of new products, and the effects of these changes on customers’ businesses and on demand for our products;
•
increasing capital requirements for building and operating new fabrication plants and customers’ ability to raise the necessary capital;
•
trade, regulatory, tax or government incentives impacting the timing of customers’ investment in new or expanded fabrication plants;
•
differences in growth rates among the semiconductor, display and other industries in which we operate;
•
the importance of establishing, improving and maintaining strong relationships with customers;
•
the cost and complexity for customers to move from product design to volume manufacturing, which may slow the adoption rate of new manufacturing technology;
•
the importance of reducing the total cost of manufacturing system ownership;
•
the importance to customers of system reliability and productivity and the effect on demand for fabrication systems as a result of their increasing productivity, device yield and reliability;
•
manufacturers’ ability to reconfigure and re-use fabrication systems which can reduce demand for new equipment;
•
the importance of developing products with sufficient differentiation to influence customers’ purchasing decisions;
