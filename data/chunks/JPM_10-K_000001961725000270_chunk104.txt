activities, this could reduce JPMorganChase’s profitability and its liquidity and capital levels, and thereby constrain the growth of its businesses.
JPMorganChase’s consumer businesses can be negatively affected by adverse economic conditions and governmental policies.
JPMorganChase’s consumer businesses are particularly affected by U.S. and global economic conditions, including:
•
personal and household income distribution
•
unemployment or underemployment
•
prolonged periods of exceptionally high or low interest rates, or significant changes to interest rates
•
changes in the value of collateral such as residential real estate and vehicles
•
changes in housing prices
•
the level of inflation and its effect on prices for goods and services
•
consumer and small business confidence levels, and
•
changes in consumer spending or in the level of consumer debt.
Heightened levels of unemployment or underemployment that result in reduced personal and household income could negatively affect consumer credit performance to the extent that consumers are less able to service their debts. In addition, sustained low growth, low or negative interest rates, inflationary pressures or recessionary conditions could diminish customer demand for the products and services offered by JPMorganChase’s consumer businesses.
Adverse economic conditions could also lead to an increase in delinquencies, additions to the allowance for credit losses and higher net charge-offs, which can reduce JPMorganChase’s earnings. These consequences could be significantly worse in certain geographies, including where declining industrial or manufacturing activity has resulted in or could result in higher levels of unemployment, or where high levels of consumer debt, such as outstanding student loans, could impair the ability of customers to pay their other consumer loan obligations.
JPMorganChase’s earnings from its consumer businesses could also be adversely affected by governmental policies and actions that affect consumers, including:
•
policies and initiatives relating to medical insurance, education, immigration and housing, or that may impact employment status
•
laws, rules and regulations relating specifically to the financial services industry, such as limitations on late payment, overdraft and interchange fees, and
•
policies aimed at the economy more broadly, such as higher taxes and increased regulation, which could result in reductions in consumer disposable income.
Unfavorable market and economic conditions can have an adverse effect on JPMorganChase’s wholesale businesses.
In JPMorganChase’s wholesale businesses, market and economic factors can affect the volume of transactions that JPMorganChase executes for its clients or for which it advises clients, and, therefore, the revenue that JPMorganChase receives from those transactions. These factors can also influence the willingness of other financial institutions and investors to participate in capital markets transactions
