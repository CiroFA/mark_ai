on our total shareholder return (“TSR”) relative to the TSR of the companies listed in the Standard & Poor’s 500 index.
During the years ended July 31, 2024 and 2023, we granted
2.1
million and
1.6
million shares of PSUs, respectively, which contain service, performance and market conditions. The service conditions are satisfied after a period of
one
to
three years
. The performance conditions are based on revenue growth or billing growth. The market condition is measured based on our TSR relative to the TSR of the companies listed in the Standard & Poor’s 500 index. As of July 31, 2024, we have approved an additional
2.7
million shares of PSUs, which will be granted upon the performance condition being established during the next
two years
.
We have also granted PSOs with both service and market conditions. The market condition for PSOs granted in the fiscal years 2018 and 2019 requires the price of our common stock to equal or exceed $
99.25
, $
132.33
, $
165.42
, and $
198.50
based on the average closing price for
30
consecutive trading days during the
four
-,
five
-,
six
-, and seven-and-a-half-year periods following the date of grant in fiscal year 2018 and 2019, respectively. Once a market condition is met, its corresponding one-fourth of the PSOs vest on each anniversary date of the grant date, subject to continued service. The maximum contractual term of our outstanding PSOs is seven and a half years from the date of grant, depending on vesting period. As of July 31, 2024, all of our outstanding PSOs have been fully vested.
We net-share settle equity awards held by certain employees by withholding shares upon vesting to satisfy tax withholding obligations. The shares withheld to satisfy employee tax withholding obligations are returned to our 2021 Plan and will be available for future issuance. Payments for employees’ tax obligations to the tax authorities are recognized as a reduction to additional paid-in capital and reflected as financing activities on our consolidated statements of cash flows.
A total of
32.8
million shares of our common stock are reserved for issuance pursuant to our equity incentive plans as of July 31, 2024.
