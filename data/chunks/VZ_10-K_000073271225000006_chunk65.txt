Cost of Services
Cost of services includes the following costs directly attributable to a service: salaries and wages, benefits, materials and supplies, content costs, contracted services, network access and transport costs, customer provisioning costs, computer systems support and costs to support our outsourcing contracts and technical facilities. Aggregate customer service costs, which include billing and service provisioning, are allocated between Cost of services and Selling, general and administrative expense.
Cost of services decreased during 2024 compared to 2023 primarily as a result of:
•
a decrease of $259 million in access costs primarily as a result of
decreases in prepaid subscribers, changes in usage and net circuit access prices;
•
a decrease of $147 million in personnel costs primarily related to the impact of workforce changes;
•
an increase of $167 million
related to an asset and business rationalization charge taken in 2024 compared to an asset rationalization charge taken in 2023; and
•
an increase of $152 million in digital content costs primarily associated with an increase in subscriptions through MyPlan offerings, partially offset by a decrease in traditional linear content costs due to a decline in Fios video subscribers.
Cost of Wireless Equipment
Cost of wireless equipment decreased during 2024 compared to 2023 primarily as a result of:
