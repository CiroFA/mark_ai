COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE (CRE).
Our CRE loan portfolio is composed of CRE mortgage and CRE construction loans. The total CRE loan portfolio decreased $2.5 billion from December 31, 2024, as paydowns exceeded originations and advances. The portfolio is diversified both geographically and by property type. The largest geographic concentrations of CRE loans are in California, New York, Florida, and Texas, which represented a combined 48% of the total CRE portfolio. The largest property type concentrations are apartments at 29% and office at 20% of the portfolio. Unfunded credit commitments at both March 31, 2025, and December 31, 2024, were $5.4 billion for CRE mortgage loans and $6.2 billion and $7.1 billion, respectively, for CRE construction loans.
We generally subject CRE loans to individual risk assessment using our internal borrower and collateral quality ratings.
We had $17.0 billion of CRE mortgage loans classified as criticized in accordance with regulatory guidance at March 31, 2025, compared with $17.8 billion at December 31, 2024. We had $1.6 billion of CRE construction loans classified as criticized in accordance with regulatory guidance at March 31, 2025, compared with $1.5 billion at December 31, 2024. The decrease in criticized CRE mortgage loans was predominantly driven by the office and apartment property types.
We continue to closely monitor the credit quality of the office property type given weakened demand for office space. Loans in California and New York represented approximately 40% of the office property type at both March 31, 2025, and December 31, 2024.
