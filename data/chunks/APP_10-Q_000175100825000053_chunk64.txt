•
we will have incurred and may continue to incur costs relating to the Transactions, many of which are payable by us whether or not the Transactions are completed;
•
matters related to the Transactions require substantial commitments of time and resources by our management team and numerous others throughout our organization, which could otherwise have been devoted to other opportunities;
•
we may be subject to legal proceedings related to the Transactions or the failure to complete the Transactions, which could be time consuming and expensive, could divert our management’s attention away from our regular business and, if any lawsuit is adversely resolved against us, could have a material and adverse effect on our financial condition;
•
the failure to complete the Transactions may result in negative publicity and a negative perception of us in the investment community, which could negative impact on our stock price; and
•
any disruptions to our business resulting from the announcement and pendency of the Transactions, including any adverse changes in our relationships with our customers, partners or employees, may continue to intensify in the event the Agreement is not consummated.

Even if the Transactions are completed, to the extent the Promissory Note is outstanding, we will face risks associated with the repayment of such note. For additional information regarding the Agreement, the Transactions, see the section titled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Recent Developments".

Additionally, while we typically include indemnification provisions in our definitive agreements related to strategic acquisitions and partnerships, these indemnification provisions may be insufficient in the event that tax liabilities are greater than expected or in areas that are not fully covered by indemnification.
