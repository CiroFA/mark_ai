Firmwide overview
JPMorganChase reported net income of $58.5 billion for 2024, up 18%, earnings per share of $19.75, ROE of 18% and ROTCE of 22%.
•
Total net revenue
was $177.6 billion, up 12%, reflecting:

Net interest income

NII excluding Markets was $92.4 billion, up 3%.
–
Noninterest revenue
(“NIR”) was $85.0 billion, up 23%, predominantly driven by a $7.9 billion net gain related to Visa shares recorded in the second quarter of 2024, higher asset management fees in AWM and CCB, higher investment banking fees, and lower net investment securities losses in Treasury and CIO.
The prior year included the estimated bargain purchase gain of $2.8 billion associated with First Republic.
