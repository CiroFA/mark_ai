Interest on the borrowings is based on an adjusted Secured Overnight Finance Rate (“SOFR”) or alternate base rate, in each case plus a margin, and undrawn commitments bear a commitment fee of 0.06%. The margin above adjusted SOFR used to calculate interest on borrowings was 0.75% plus an additional credit spread adjustment of 0.10% to account for the difference between London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) and SOFR. The margin is subject to change based on Blackstone’s credit rating. Borrowings may also be made in U.K. sterling, euros, Swiss francs, Japanese yen or Canadian dollars, in each case subject to certain sub-limits. The Revolving Credit Facility contains customary representations, covenants and events of default.
