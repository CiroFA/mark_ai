Cash inflows from operating activities were $9.2 billion in 2024, driven by net income adjusted for non-cash provisions and lower inventories and receivables from a decline in sales. These items were partially offset by a decrease in vendor payables and a reduction in dealer sales incentive accruals.
Cash
outflows from investing activities were $6.5 billion in 2024 due to growth in the financing receivable and lease portfolios and capital expenditures.
Cash outflows from financing activities were $2.7 billion in 2024, as repurchases of common stock and dividends paid were partially offset by higher borrowings.
Cash Returned to Shareholders
Cash returned to shareholders decreased $3.0 billion in 2024 as we managed cash flows through the declining business cycle in accordance with our use-of-cash priorities.
To access public debt capital markets, we rely on credit rating agencies to assign short-term and long-term credit ratings to our debt securities as an indicator of credit quality for fixed income investors.
A security rating is not a recommendation by the rating agency to buy, sell, or hold our securities. A credit rating agency may change or withdraw ratings based on its assessment of our current and future ability to meet interest and principal repayment obligations. Each agency’s rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Lower credit ratings generally
result in higher borrowing costs, including costs of derivative transactions, reduced access to debt capital markets, and may adversely impact our liquidity.
The senior long-term and short-term debt ratings and outlook currently assigned to unsecured company securities by the rating agencies engaged by us are as follows:

Our material cash requirements include the following:
Borrowings
– As of October 27, 2024, we had $17.6 billion of payments due on borrowings and securitization borrowings in the next year, along with interest payments of $2.5 billion. The securitization borrowing payments are based on the expected liquidation of the retail notes. See Notes 12 and 19 for additional borrowing details. These payments will likely be replaced with new borrowings to finance the receivable and lease portfolio, which is expected to be lower in 2025.
Purchase Obligations
– As of October 27, 2024, our outstanding purchase obligations were $3.2 billion, with $2.8 billion payable within one year. These purchase obligations are noncancelable.
