1.13
billion has been recognized for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

The reconciliation of taxes at the federal statutory rate to our provision for (benefit from) income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 was as follows (in millions):
Deferred tax assets (liabilities) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 consisted of the following (in millions):
82
As of December 31, 2024, we maintained valuation allowances of $
1.22
billion for deferred tax assets that are not more likely than not to be realized, which primarily included our California deferred tax assets, U.S. foreign tax credits and certain foreign operating losses. The valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets increased by $
332
million during the year ended December 31, 2024, and decreased by $
6.46
billion and $
1.73
billion during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The valuation allowance increase during the year ended December 31, 2024 was primarily due to the changes of our California deferred tax assets, U.S. foreign tax credits and certain foreign operating losses. The change in valuation allowance during the year ended December 31, 2023 was primarily due to the release of our valuation allowance with respect to our U.S. federal and certain state deferred tax assets. In the fourth quarter of 2023, based on the relevant weight of positive and negative evidence, including the amount of our taxable income in recent years which was objective and verifiable, and consideration of our expected future taxable earnings, we concluded that it is more likely than not that most of our U.S. federal and certain state deferred tax assets are realizable and released the valuation allowance on these deferred tax assets. The valuation allowance change during the years ended December 31, 2022 was primarily due to changes in our U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities. Our deferred tax assets without a valuation allowance are more likely than not to be realized given the expectation of future earnings in the respective jurisdictions.
As of December 31, 2024, we had $
4.34
billion of federal and $
8.59
billion of state net operating loss carry-forwards available to offset future taxable income, an immaterial amount of which, if not utilized, will begin to expire in 2026 for federal and 2025 for state purposes.
