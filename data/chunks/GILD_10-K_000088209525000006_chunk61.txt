requirements, we believe that we can satisfy our capital needs for the next 12 months and the foreseeable future.
Liquidity
Cash and cash equivalents were $10.0 billion as of December 31, 2024. The table below summarizes our cash flow activities, followed by our analysis of changes and trends:
Operating Activities
Net cash provided by operating activities is our primary source of funds, driven mainly by collections on product sales, partially offset by operating spend. Changes in working capital balances, generally associated with the timing of collections and payments, as well as unanticipated payments related to litigation, taxes or other matters, may create some variation in any given year. Net cash provided by operating activities increased in 2024 mainly due to higher collections on sales and lower income tax and operating payments. Net cash provided by operating activities included $0.5 billion in HIV antitrust litigation settlement payments in 2023, as well as transition tax payments associated with the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of $1.2 billion and $0.9 billion in 2024 and 2023, respectively.

We expect Net cash provided by operating activities in 2025 to include the effect of an approximately $1.3 billion transition tax payment.
Investing Activities
Net cash used in investing activities was notably higher in 2024 primarily related to the $3.9 billion net cash payment for the CymaBay acquisition, partially offset by proceeds from the liquidation of marketable debt securities to fund that acquisition. Net cash used in investing activities may vary in any given year depending on the favorability of strategic opportunities for the business.
Financing Activities
Net cash used in financing activities in 2024 was primarily the result of $2.0 billion for debt repayments, $3.9 billion for dividend payments and $1.2 billion for common stock repurchases, partially offset by $3.5 billion in net proceeds from the issuance of senior unsecured notes in November 2024. In 2023, we utilized cash of $2.3 billion for debt repayments, $3.8 billion for dividend payments and $1.0 billion for common stock repurchases, partially offset by $2.0 billion in net proceeds from the issuance of senior unsecured notes in September 2023. The year-over-year changes were due mostly to higher cash provided by new debt issuances. Net cash used in financing activities may vary in any given year depending primarily on the timing of debt repayments and proceeds from debt offerings and the amount of common stock repurchases.
Subsequently, in February 2025, we repaid $1.75 billion of principal balance related to our senior unsecured notes due February 2025. Also, on February 11, 2025, we announced that our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.79 per share of our common stock, with a payment date of March 28, 2025 to all stockholders of record as of the close of business on March 14, 2025. Future dividends are subject to declaration by our Board of Directors.
