Unobservable inputs which are related to observable inputs, such as illiquid portions of forward price or volatility curves, are updated daily as well, using industry standard techniques such as interpolation and extrapolation, combining observable forward inputs supplemented by historical market and other relevant data. Other unobservable inputs, such as implied correlations, block-to-hourly price shaping, customer migration rates from full

requirements contracts and some implied volatility curves, are modeled using proprietary models based on historical data and industry standard techniques.
The significant unobservable inputs used in the valuation of NEE's commodity contracts categorized as Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy at March 31, 2025 are as follows:
———————————————
(a)
Unobservable inputs were weighted by volume.
(b)
Applies only to full requirements contracts.
The sensitivity of NEE's fair value measurements to increases (decreases) in the significant unobservable inputs is as follows:
———————————————
(a)
Assumes the contract is in a gain position.

The reconciliation of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are based on significant unobservable inputs is as follows:
———————————————
(a)
Transfers into Level 3 were a result of decreased observability of market data. Transfers from Level 3 to Level 2 were a result of increased observability of market data.
Income Statement Impact of Derivative Instruments
–
Gains (losses) related to NEE's derivatives are recorded in NEE's condensed consolidated statements of income as follows:
———————————————
(a)
For the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, FPL recorded approximately $
32
million of gains and $
20
million of losses, respectively, related to commodity contracts as regulatory liabilities and regulatory assets, respectively, on its condensed consolidated balance sheets.
Notional Volumes of Derivative Instruments
– The following table represents net notional volumes associated with derivative instruments that are required to be reported at fair value in NEE's and FPL's condensed consolidated financial statements. The table includes significant volumes of transactions that have minimal exposure to commodity price changes because they are variably priced agreements. These volumes are only an indication of the commodity exposure that is managed through the use of derivatives. They do not represent net physical asset positions or non-derivative positions and the related hedges, nor do they represent NEE’s and FPL’s net economic exposure, but only the net notional derivative positions that fully or partially hedge the related asset positions.
NEE and FPL had derivative commodity contracts for the
