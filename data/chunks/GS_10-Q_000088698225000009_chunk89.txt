Note 3. The following provides a description of the primary components of the firm’s segment results disclosed in the table below.
•
The firm fully allocates its revenues, expenses, assets and shareholders’ equity to the firm’s
three
business segments.
•
Revenues and expenses directly associated with each segment are included in determining pre-tax earnings for the respective segment.
•
Net revenues in the firm’s segments include allocations of interest income and interest expense based on the funding generated by, or the funding and liquidity requirements of the respective segments. Net interest is included in segment net revenues as it is consistent with how management assesses segment performance.
•
Expenses not directly associated with specific segments are allocated among the business segments based on an estimate of support provided to each segment.
•
Compensation and benefits expenses in the firm’s segments reflect, among other factors, the overall performance of the firm, as well as the performance of individual businesses. Consequently, pre-tax margins in one segment of the firm’s business may be significantly affected by the performance of the firm’s other business segments.
•
Certain assets (including allocations of global core liquid assets and cash, and secured client financing), not directly associated with specific segments are generally allocated among the business segments based on the funding and liquidity requirements of the segments.
•
Common shareholders’ equity and preferred stock dividends are allocated to each segment based on the estimated amount of equity required to support the activities of the segment under relevant regulatory capital requirements.
•
Net earnings for each segment is calculated by applying the firmwide tax rate to each segment’s pre-tax earnings.
•
Management believes that this allocation provides a reasonable representation of each segment’s contribution to consolidated net earnings to common, return on average common equity and total assets. Due to the integrated nature of these segments, estimates and judgments are made in allocating these assets, revenues and expenses. Transactions between segments are based on specific criteria or approximate third-party rates.
