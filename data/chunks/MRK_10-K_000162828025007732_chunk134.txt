Research and development (R&D) expenses were $17.9 billion in 2024, a decline of 41% compared with 2023. The decline was primarily due to lower charges for business development activity and the favorable effect of foreign exchange.
Significant business development transactions in 2024 include charges of:
•
$1.35 billion for the acquisition of EyeBio and $100 million for a related developmental milestone
•
$750 million for the acquisition of MK-1045 (formerly CN201) from Curon
•
$656 million for the acquisition of Harpoon
•
$588 million for a global license agreement with LaNova
•
$112 million for a global license agreement with Hansoh
Significant business development transactions in 2023 include charges of:
•
$10.2 billion for the acquisition of Prometheus
•
$5.5 billion related to the formation of a collaboration with Daiichi Sankyo
•
$1.2 billion for the acquisition of Imago
•
$175 million for a license and collaboration agreement with Kelun-Biotech
The decline in R&D expenses was partially offset by higher compensation and benefit costs (reflecting in part increased headcount) and increased clinical development spending, including for recently acquired programs.
R&D expenses are comprised of the costs directly incurred by Merck Research Laboratories (MRL), the Company’s research and development division that focuses on human health-related activities, which were $10.1 billion in 2024 and $9.0 billion in 2023. Also included in R&D expenses are Animal Health research costs, upfront payments for collaboration and licensing agreements (including charges for the transactions with LaNova, Hansoh, Daiichi Sankyo and Kelun-Biotech noted above), charges for transactions accounted for as asset acquisitions (including charges for the acquisitions of EyeBio, MK-1045, Harpoon, Prometheus and Imago noted above) and costs incurred by other divisions in support of R&D activities, including depreciation, production and general and administrative, which in the aggregate were $7.7 billion in 2024 and $20.7 billion in 2023. R&D expenses also include an impairment charge of $779 million in 2023 (related to gefapixant). See Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to this impairment charge. The Company may recognize additional impairment charges in the future related to the cancellation or delay of other pipeline programs that were measured at fair value and capitalized in connection with business combinations and such charges could be material.
Restructuring Costs
In January 2024, the Company approved a new restructuring program (2024 Restructuring Program) intended to continue the optimization of the Company’s Human Health global manufacturing network as the future pipeline shifts to new modalities and also optimize the Animal Health global manufacturing network to improve supply reliability and increase efficiency. The actions contemplated under the 2024 Restructuring Program are expected to be substantially completed by
