Insurance—Underwriting
GEICO
Premiums written increased $710 million (6.6%) in the first quarter of 2025 compared to 2024, reflecting an increase in policies-in-force and higher average premiums per policy. Premiums earned increased $518 million (5.1%) in the first quarter of 2025 compared to 2024.
Losses and loss adjustment expenses increased $10 million (0.1%) in the first quarter of 2025 compared to 2024. GEICO’s loss ratio (losses and loss adjustment expenses to premiums earned) was 69.0% in the first quarter of 2025, a decrease of 3.5 percentage points compared to 2024. The loss ratio decline reflected the impact of higher average premiums per auto policy and lower claims frequencies, partially offset by increases in average claims severities and less favorable development of prior accident years’ claims estimates.
Private passenger automobile claims frequencies declined in the first quarter of 2025 versus 2024 for property damage and collision coverages (six to nine percent range), with bodily injury coverage down slightly. Average auto claims severities increased in the first quarter of 2025 for property damage and collision coverages (one to three percent range) and bodily injury coverage (six to eight percent range) compared to 2024. Losses and loss adjustment expenses included reductions in the ultimate loss estimates for prior accident years’ claims of $45 million in the first quarter of 2025 compared to $155 million in 2024.
Underwriting expenses increased $263 million in the first quarter of 2025 compared to 2024. GEICO’s expense ratio (underwriting expense to premiums earned) was 10.8% in the first quarter of 2025, an increase of 2.1 percentage points compared to 2024, attributable to increased policy acquisition related expenses, partially offset by increased operating leverage. The earnings from GEICO’s insurance agency (third-party commissions, net of operating expenses) are included as a reduction of underwriting expenses.
