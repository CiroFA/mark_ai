Since our personal auto products represented about 90% of our Personal Lines segment net premiums written at quarter end, much of the following discussion will focus on our personal auto products, both in total and by distribution channel. We will also discuss our personal property products as we continue to focus on improving profitability and reducing our concentration and exposure in more volatile weather-related markets.
Our Commercial Lines segment writes auto-related liability and physical damage insurance, business-related general liability and commercial property insurance predominantly for small businesses, and workers’ compensation insurance primarily for the transportation industry and includes our core commercial auto products, TNC business, Fleet & Specialty products, and BOP product. Of our total Commercial Lines segment, our core commercial auto products represented about 80% of net premiums written and our TNC business represented about 15%, both on a trailing 12-month basis, as of the end of the first quarter 2025. Therefore, much of the following discussion focuses only on our core commercial auto products.

Robinsons - homeowners who bundle auto and home.

Our special lines and personal property products are written for 12-month terms. About 55% and 70%, respectively, of our special lines products and personal property business net premiums written was generated through the independent agency channel, with the balance through the direct channel.
