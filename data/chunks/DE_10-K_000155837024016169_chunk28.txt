$
326
in 2024,
$

8. INCOME TAXES
We are subject to income taxes in a number of jurisdictions. We determine our income tax provision using the asset and liability method.
The provision for income taxes by taxing jurisdiction and by significant component consisted of the following:
​
​
Based upon the location of our operations, the consolidated income before income taxes in the U.S. in 2024, 2023, and 2022 was
$
5.9
billion,
$
7.8
billion, and
$
5.0
billion, respectively, and in foreign countries was
$
3.3
billion,
$
5.2
billion, and
$
4.1
billion, respectively. Certain foreign operations are branches or partnerships of Deere & Company and are subject to U.S. as well as foreign income tax regulations. The pretax income by location and the preceding analysis of the income tax provision by taxing jurisdiction are not directly related.

A comparison of the statutory and effective income tax provision and reasons for related differences follow:

not practicable
.
Deferred income taxes arise because there are certain items that are treated differently for financial accounting than for income tax reporting purposes.
An analysis of the deferred income tax assets and liabilities at October 27, 2024 and October 29, 2023 follows:

​
Deere & Company files a consolidated federal income tax return in the U.S., which includes the wholly-owned financial services subsidiaries. These subsidiaries account for income taxes as if they filed separate income tax returns, with a modification for realizability of certain tax benefits.
At October 27, 2024, tax loss and tax credit carryforwards of
$
1,564

A reconciliation of unrecognized tax benefits at October 27, 2024, October 29, 2023, and October 30, 2022 follows:
​
​
The amount of unrecognized tax benefits at October 27, 2024 and October 29, 2023 that would impact the effective tax rate if the tax benefits were recognized was
$
410
and
$
329
, respectively. The remaining liability was related to tax positions for which there are offsetting tax receivables, or the uncertainty was only related to timing. We expect that any reasonably possible change in the amounts of unrecognized tax benefits in the next twelve months
