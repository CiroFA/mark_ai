Schwab’s EVE profile is characterized by a more stable asset duration relative to liabilities in both higher and lower interest rate environments. Currently, the EVE exposure to rates increasing or decreasing in a similar magnitude shows that there is greater exposure to rates decreasing.
Bank Deposit Account Fees Simulation
Consistent with the presentation on the consolidated statement of income, the sensitivity of bank deposit account fee revenue to interest rate changes is assessed separately from the net interest revenue simulation described above. As of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, simulated changes in bank deposit account fee revenue from gradual changes in market interest rates relative to prevailing market rates, under the interest rate scenarios described above for net interest revenue, did not have a significant impact on the Company’s total net revenues. Our net interest revenue, EVE, and bank deposit account fee revenue simulations reflect the assumption of non-negative investment yields.

We employ a variety of metrics to monitor and manage liquidity. We conduct regular liquidity stress testing to develop a view of liquidity risk exposures and to ensure our
