brokerage accounts ended 2024 at 36.5 million, up 5% on the year.
The Company’s financial results in 2024 reflected the impact of positive equity markets, solid asset gathering, sustained client engagement, and improvement in client cash trends. Net income totaled $5.9 billion in 2024, up 17% year-over-year, and diluted EPS was $2.99, an increase of 18% over the prior year. Adjusted diluted EPS
(1)
was $3.25 in 2024, up 4% from $3.13 in 2023.
Total net revenues rose 4% year-over-year to $19.6 billion in 2024. Net interest revenue was $9.1 billion in 2024, down 3% from 2023, which reflected lower average interest-earning assets and higher rates on funding sources, partially offset by growth in margin and bank lending and lower bank supplemental funding. Client cash realignment activity continued to decelerate in 2024, and principal and interest payments on the AFS and HTM investment securities portfolios supported reductions in bank supplemental funding balances. Asset management and administration fees were $5.7 billion in 2024, increasing 20% from the prior year primarily as a result of growth in money market funds, equity market gains, and growth in managed investing solutions. Trading revenue was $3.3 billion in 2024, up 1% from the prior year, reflecting higher volume and changes in mix of client trading activity. Bank deposit account fee revenue totaled $729 million in 2024, up 3% year-over-year, due primarily to $97 million in breakage fees recognized in 2023, partially offset by lower average BDA balances. BDA balances totaled $87.6 billion at December 31, 2024, down 10% from year-end 2023 primarily resulting from lower client cash allocations.
Total expenses excluding interest were $11.9 billion in 2024, down 4% from 2023. This decrease reflected lower restructuring costs, lower acquisition and integration-related costs, and lower regulatory fees and assessments due primarily to a $172 million FDIC special assessment recognized in the fourth quarter of 2023 (see Current Regulatory and Other Developments). These lower expenses were partially offset by higher incentive compensation, higher depreciation and amortization due to continued investment to support growth of the business, and higher other expense. Other expense reflected higher industry fees resulting from the SEC’s May 2024 fee rate increase. Adjusted total expenses
(1)
were $11.3 billion in 2024, up 2% from 2023. Acquisition and integration-related costs, amortization of acquired intangible assets, and restructuring costs totaled $645 million in 2024, down 55% from 2023, as substantially all of the Company’s costs related to its restructuring were incurred in 2023, and spending for the Ameritrade integration decreased in 2024 as we completed the final integration activities.
