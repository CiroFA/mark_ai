timely manner.
As our workforce composition continues to change, our employees may have different expectations with respect to flexibility and well-being support, and may have different career motivations (such as pursuing project-based work or other gig opportunities, as opposed to linear career paths).  Additionally, employees may require different levels of support as to re-skilling and upskilling in order to adapt to advancements in our industry and changes in technology.  Further, certain current and prospective employees may have expectations as to positions we take on environmental, social and governance matters.  To the extent we are unable to effectively meet and/or balance these different expectations, motivations and needs, we could experience a negative impact to the quality of our corporate culture, the productivity of our workforce, our ability to innovate and our ability to attract and retain talent.

We continue to evaluate our strategic acquisitions of, and investments in, complementary businesses, products or technologies.

We also face competition for acquisition targets due to the nature of the market for technology companies.  As a result, we could be prevented from successfully completing such acquisitions in the future.  If we are not successful in these efforts, we could lose strategic opportunities that are dependent, in part, on inorganic growth.
To the extent we do make these acquisitions, we may not be able to successfully partner with or integrate them, despite original intentions and focused efforts.  Such an integration also may divert managementâ€™s time and resources from our core business and disrupt our operations.  Moreover, we have spent, and may continue to spend, time and money on acquisitions or projects that do
