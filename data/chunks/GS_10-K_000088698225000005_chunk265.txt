Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
The table below presents information about lending commitments.
In the table above:
•
Held for investment lending commitments are accounted for at amortized cost. The carrying value of lending commitments was a liability of $
929
million (including allowance for credit losses of $
674
million) as of December 2024 and $
845
million (including allowance for credit losses of $
620
million) as of December 2023. The estimated fair value of such lending commitments was a liability of $
4.84
billion as of December 2024 and $
5.29
billion as of December 2023. Had these lending commitments been carried at fair value and included in the fair value hierarchy, $
2.44
billion as of December 2024 and $
3.10
billion as of December 2023 would have been classified in level 2, and $
2.40
billion as of December 2024 and $
2.19
billion as of December 2023 would have been classified in level 3.
•
Held for sale lending commitments are accounted for at the lower of cost or fair value. The carrying value of lending commitments held for sale was a liability of $
43
million as of December 2024 and $
70
million as of December 2023. The estimated fair value of such lending commitments approximates the carrying value. Had these lending commitments been included in the fair value hierarchy, they would have been primarily classified in level 3 as of both December 2024 and December 2023.
•
Gains or losses related to lending commitments at fair value, if any, are generally recorded net of any fees in other principal transactions.

billion as of December 2024 and $
137.11
billion as of December 2023, related to relationship lending activities (principally used for operating and general corporate purposes), and $
11.26
billion as of December 2024 and $
4.21
billion as of December 2023, related to other investment banking activities (generally extended for contingent acquisition financing and are often intended to be short-term in nature, as borrowers often seek to replace them with other funding sources).
