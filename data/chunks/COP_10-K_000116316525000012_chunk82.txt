In February 2025, we announced our 2025 planned return of capital to shareholders of $10 billion, at current commodity prices, through our return of capital framework. We plan to deliver a compelling, growing ordinary dividend and through-cycle share repurchases. We anticipate returning greater than 30 percent of cash from operating activities during periods where commodity prices are meaningfully higher than our planning price range. Our 2024 total capital returned was $9.1 billion.
In 2023, we issued $2.7 billion principal amount of new debt to fund our acquisition of the remaining 50 percent working interest in Surmont and completed refinancing transactions consisting of $1.1 billion in tender offers to repurchase existing debt with cash and a $1.1 billion new debt issuance to fund the repurchases. In 2022, we executed concurrent debt refinancing transactions, repurchased existing notes, and retired floating rate notes upon natural maturity, that in aggregate reduced our total debt by $3.3 billion, while also lowering our annual cash interest expense and extending the weighted average maturity of our debt portfolio.

Consistent with our commitment to deliver value to shareholders, for the full year of 2024, we paid ordinary dividends of $2.52 per common share and VROC payments of $0.60 per common share. In the fourth quarter of 2024, we incorporated the equivalent amount of prior quarter VROC into the ordinary dividend. In 2023 we paid ordinary dividends of $2.11 and VROC payments of $2.50 per common share and in 2022 we paid an ordinary dividend of $1.89 and VROC payments of $2.60. In February 2025, we declared a first-quarter ordinary dividend of $0.78 per common share payable March 3, 2025, to shareholders of record on February 17, 2025.
VROC remains a discretionary option in elevated price environments. The ordinary dividend and VROC are subject to numerous considerations and are determined and approved each quarter by the Board of Directors. Beginning in the first quarter of 2024, we announced and paid quarterly dividends and VROC payments concurrently. VROC payments had been paid in the subsequent quarter of announcement in 2023 and 2022.
In late 2016, we initiated our current share repurchase program. In October 2024, our Board of Directors approved an increase from our prior authorization of $45 billion by a total of the lesser of $20 billion or the number of shares issued in our acquisition of Marathon Oil, such that the company is not to exceed $65 billion in aggregate repurchases. Share repurchases were $5.5 billion, $5.4 billion, and $9.3 billion in 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. As of December 31, 2024, share
