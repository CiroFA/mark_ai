Risk Factors
Our business results are subject to a variety of risks, including those that are described below and elsewhere in our filings with the
SEC. The risks described below are not the only risks we face. Additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also significantly adversely affect our business. If any of these risks were to materialize or intensify, our expectations (or the underlying assumptions) may change and our performance may be adversely affected.
STRATEGY AND BRAND
If we do not successfully evolve and execute against our business strategies, we may not be able to drive business growth.

growth strategy – must be effective in maintaining and strengthening customer appeal and capturing additional market share. Whether these strategies are successful depends mainly on our System’s continued ability to:

•
accelerate our existing strategies, including through growth opportunities and building a modern company platform that unlocks speed and innovation throughout the organization; and
•
evolve and adjust our strategies in response to, among other things, changing consumer behavior, and other events impacting our results of operations and liquidity.

Failure to preserve the value or relevance of our brand could have an adverse impact on our financial results.
