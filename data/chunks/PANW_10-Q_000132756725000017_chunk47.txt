economic environment may exacerbate the risks described below, any of which could have a material impact on us.
Risk Factor Summary
Our business is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties. These risks include, but are not limited to, the following:
•
Our operating results may be adversely affected by unfavorable economic and market conditions and the uncertain geopolitical environment.
•
Our business and operations have experienced growth in recent periods, and if we do not effectively manage any future growth or are unable to improve our systems, processes, and controls, our operating results could be adversely affected.
•
Our revenue growth rate in recent periods may not be indicative of our future performance, and we may not be able to maintain profitability, which could cause our business, financial condition, and operating results to suffer.
•
Our operating results may vary significantly from period to period, which makes our results difficult to predict and could cause our results to fall short of expectations, and such results may not be indicative of future performance.
•
Seasonality may cause fluctuations in our revenue.
•
If we are unable to sell new and additional product, subscription, and support offerings to our end-customers, especially to large enterprise customers, our future revenue and operating results will be harmed.
•
If we are unable to attract new customers, our future results of operations could be harmed.
•
We rely on revenue from subscription and support offerings, and because we recognize revenue from subscription and support over the term of the relevant service period, downturns or upturns in sales or renewals of these subscription and support offerings are not immediately reflected in full in our operating results.
•
The sales prices of our products, subscriptions, and support offerings may decrease, which may reduce our revenue and gross profits and adversely impact our financial results.
•
We rely on our channel partners to sell substantially all of our products, including subscriptions and support, and if these channel partners fail to perform, our ability to sell and distribute our products and subscriptions will be limited and our operating results will be harmed.
•
We are exposed to the credit and liquidity risk of our customers, and to credit exposure in weakened markets, which could result in material losses.
•
A portion of our revenue is generated by sales to government entities, which are subject to a number of challenges and risks.
•
We face intense competition in our market and we may lack sufficient financial or other resources to maintain or improve our competitive position.
•
We may acquire other businesses, which could subject us to adverse claims or liabilities, require significant management attention, disrupt our business, adversely affect our operating results, may not result in the expected benefits of such acquisitions, and may dilute stockholder value.
•
If we do not accurately predict,
