Restructuring
In January 2024, the Company approved a new restructuring program (2024 Restructuring Program) intended to continue the optimization of the Company’s Human Health global manufacturing network as the future pipeline shifts to new modalities and also optimize the Animal Health global manufacturing network to improve supply reliability and increase efficiency. The actions contemplated under the 2024 Restructuring Program are expected to be substantially completed by the end of 2031, with the cumulative pretax costs to be incurred by the Company to implement the program estimated to be approximately $
4.0
billion. Approximately
60
% of the cumulative pretax costs will be non-cash, relating primarily to the accelerated depreciation of facilities to be closed or divested. The remainder of the costs will result in cash outlays, relating primarily to facility shut-down costs. The Company recorded total pretax costs of $
888
million and $
190
million in 2024 and 2023, respectively, related to the 2024 Restructuring Program, bringing total cumulative pretax costs incurred through December 31, 2024 to $
1.1
billion.
In 2019, Merck approved a global restructuring program (2019 Restructuring Program) as part of a worldwide initiative focused on optimizing the Company’s manufacturing and supply network, as well as reducing its global real estate footprint. The Company recorded total pretax costs of $
743
million in 2023 and $
666
million in 2022 related to the 2019 Restructuring Program. The actions under the 2019 Restructuring Program were substantially complete at the end of 2023 and, as of January 1, 2024, any remaining activities are being accounted for as part of the 2024 Restructuring Program.
