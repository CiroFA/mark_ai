customers, to expand its relationships with existing clients and customers, or to hire or retain employees, or
•
certain investors opting to divest from investments in securities of JPMorganChase.
Actions by the financial services industry generally or individuals in the industry can also affect JPMorganChase’s reputation. For example, the reputation of the industry as a whole can be damaged by concerns that:
•
consumers have been treated unfairly by a financial institution, or
•
a financial institution has acted inappropriately with respect to the methods used to offer products to customers.
If JPMorganChase is perceived to have engaged in these types of behaviors, this could weaken its reputation among clients or customers, employees or other stakeholders.
Failure to effectively manage potential conflicts of interest or to satisfy fiduciary obligations can result in litigation and enforcement actions, as well as damage JPMorganChase’s reputation.
JPMorganChase’s ability to manage potential conflicts of interest is highly complex due to the broad range of its business activities which encompass a variety of transactions, obligations and interests with and among JPMorganChase’s clients and customers. JPMorganChase can become subject to litigation, enforcement actions, and heightened regulatory scrutiny, and its reputation can be damaged, by the failure or perceived failure to:
•
adequately address or appropriately disclose conflicts of interest, including potential conflicts of interest that may arise in connection with providing multiple products and services in, or having one or more investments related to, the same transaction
•
identify and address any conflict of interest that a third party with which it is does business may have with respect to a transaction involving JPMorganChase
•
deliver appropriate standards of service and quality
•
treat clients and customers fairly and with the appropriate standard of care
•
use client and customer data responsibly and in a manner that meets legal requirements and regulatory expectations
•
provide fiduciary products or services in accordance with the applicable legal and regulatory standards, or
•
handle or use confidential information of customers or clients appropriately and in compliance with applicable data protection and privacy laws, rules and regulations.
A failure or perceived failure to appropriately address conflicts of interest or fiduciary obligations could result in customer dissatisfaction, litigation and regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions, and heightened regulatory scrutiny and enforcement actions, all of which can lead to lost revenue and higher operating costs and cause serious harm to JPMorganChase’s reputation.
