by current receivables of $(0.8) billion, driven by billings outpacing collections across our businesses; and accounts payable and equipment
project payables of $(0.7) billion, driven by higher disbursements, including prepayments of supply chain finance programs at Wind and
Power.

was less than
$(0.1) billion
and
$(0.7) billion
for the

respectively.
Cash from (used for) investing activities increased by
$0.7 billion
in
2024
compared to
2023
primarily driven by: net proceeds from principal
business dispositions of $0.8 billion, primarily as a result of our Steam Power business sale of part of its nuclear activities to EDF in our
Power segment; and the nonrecurrence of the net impact of our acquisition of Nexus Controls and other investment sales of $0.2 billion in
2023; partially offset by an increase in additions to PP&E and internal-use software of $0.1 billion. Net sales of and distributions from equity
method investments were flat, as t
he sale of a 3% equity interest in China XD Electric Co., Ltd. in the fourth quarter of 202
4 was offset by
lower sales in our Financial Services business. Cash used for additions to PP&E and internal-use software, which is a component of free
cash flow*, was
$0.9 billion and $0.7 billion fo
r the
years ended
