section, in the first quarter of 2025, we made changes to the reported revenue categories within our Software and Consulting reportable segments. IBM's Software segment reports revenue and year-to-year revenue percent change for Hybrid Cloud (Red Hat), Automation, Data, and Transaction Processing. The Software segment no longer reports Hybrid Platform & Solutions or Security revenue categories.
