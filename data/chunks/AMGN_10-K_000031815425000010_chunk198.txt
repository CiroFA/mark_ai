Shareholder Derivative Actions (Martin, Clearwater and DM Cohen)
On August 2, 2023, Leon Martin filed a derivative action (the Martin Derivative Action) captioned
Leon Martin v. Robert A. Bradway, et al., No. 1:23-cv-06754
(S.D.N.Y. Aug. 2, 2023), purportedly on behalf of Amgen, against Amgen, Robert Bradway, Peter Griffith and Amgen’s independent Board members. The action was filed in the Southern District Court of New York as related to the pending federal securities class action filed by Roofers Local No. 149 Pension Fund on March 13, 2023 (the Roofers securities class action). The complaint in this matter alleges claims for violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, breach of fiduciary duty, aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment and waste of corporate assets.
On December 7, 2023, Plaintiff filed a Notice of Voluntary Dismissal as to Board member Michael Drake.
On December 1, 2023, a second derivative action (the Clearwater Derivative Action) was filed, captioned
Cheri Clearwater v. Robert A. Bradway, et al., No. 1:23-cv-10538
(S.D.N.Y. Dec. 1, 2023), in the same court as the earlier-filed Martin Derivative Action. The second action is largely duplicative of the Martin Derivative Action, asserting the same claims purportedly on behalf of the Company against the individual directors that sat on Amgen’s Board during the relevant time period (July 29, 2020 through April 27, 2022). The complaint asserts claims for breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, waste of corporate assets, abuse of control, gross mismanagement, and violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act arising out of Amgen’s disclosures with respect to its transfer pricing dispute with the IRS. However, the Clearwater Derivative Action complaint adds (1)
two
additional claims for violations of Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act; (2) allegations that Amgen repurchased its own stock at artificially inflated prices during the relevant period; and (3) more detailed allegations as to why first making a demand on the Board would have been futile.
On January 16, 2024, the Southern District Court of New York consolidated the Martin Derivative Action and Clearwater Derivative Action (the Consolidated Action). The Southern District Court of New York entered an Order staying the Consolidated Action until a final judgment is entered in the federal securities class action.
