Trade Policy
PMI complies with all applicable trade restrictions and requirements, including sanctions, in the markets in which it operates. We have taken appropriate actions in response to the latest sanctions to ensure full compliance with the relevant restrictions.
We are subject to various trade restrictions imposed by the U.S., the EU, Switzerland, the U.K., and other jurisdictions in which we do business (“Trade Sanctions”), including the trade and economic sanctions administered by the U.S. Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”) and the U.S. Department of State.  It is our policy to comply fully with these Trade Sanctions.
Pursuant to specific exemptions or licenses, or where sanctions do not apply to our business, PMI may make sales in countries subject to Trade Sanctions.
We do not do business or sell products in Belarus, Iran, North Korea or Syria.
The distribution agreement for the sale of our products in Cuba, under which we previously sold cigarettes in that market, has been terminated, effective February 1, 2025. We no longer maintain an active distribution agreement for the sale of our products in Cuba.
Certain states within the U.S. have enacted legislation permitting or requiring state pension funds to divest or abstain from future investment in stocks of companies that do business with certain countries that are sanctioned by the U.S.  Because we do business in certain of these countries, consistent with our policy to fully comply with Trade Sanctions and as described above, these state pension funds may have divested of our stock or may not invest in our stock. We do not believe such legislation has had a material effect on the price of our shares.
