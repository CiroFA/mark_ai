required and the need for professionals with expertise in information technology (IT) to identify, evaluate, and test the Company’s systems, databases, automated controls, and system interface controls.
How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit
Our audit procedures related to the Company’s service and equipment revenue transactions included the following, among others:
•
With the assistance of our IT specialists, we:
◦
Identified the relevant systems and databases used to process service and equipment revenue transactions and tested the relevant IT controls over each of those systems and databases.
◦
Performed testing of automated business controls and system interface controls within service and equipment revenues.
•
We tested internal controls in the revenue accounting processes, including those in place to (a) establish revenue recognition accounting policies for promotional offers, (b) record revenue and the related promotional offers in accordance with the established accounting policies and (c) reconcile the various systems to the Company’s general ledger.
•
We created data visualizations to evaluate recorded service and equipment revenue and trends in the related subscriber data.
•
For a selection of wholesale service revenue and equipment revenue transactions, we compared the amounts recognized to contractual agreements or other source documents and tested the mathematical accuracy of the recorded revenue.
•
We developed an expectation of postpaid and prepaid service revenue amounts using historical service revenue and subscriber information and compared it to the recorded amount.
•
We tested the accuracy and completeness of the subscriber information used in our audit procedures by selecting a sample of the subscriber information and for those selections agreeing the selected subscriber information to supporting documentation.
