Note 2
Earnings Per Share
Basic earnings per share is determined using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share is determined using the weighted average number of common shares and potential common shares (representing the dilutive effect of restricted stock units and employee stock purchase plan shares) outstanding during the period. Our net income has not been adjusted for any period presented for purposes of computing basic or diluted earnings per share due to our non-complex capital structure.
Excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share are securities attributable to outstanding restricted stock units where the combined exercise price and average unamortized fair value are greater than the average market price of our common stock, and therefore their inclusion would be anti-dilutive.

Gains and Losses on Investments
At October 27, 2024, gross unrealized losses related to our fixed income portfolio were not material. We regularly review our fixed income portfolio to identify and evaluate investments that have indications of possible impairment from credit losses or other factors. Factors considered in determining whether an unrealized loss is considered to be a credit loss include: the significance of the decline in value compared to the cost basis; the financial condition; credit quality and near-term prospects of the investee; and whether it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security prior to recovery.
