the firm’s market-making or risk management activities. These instruments are carried at fair value and the related fair value gains and losses are recognized in the consolidated statements of earnings.

In the table above:
•
Other includes government and agency obligations, state and municipal obligations, other debt obligations, equity securities and commodities.
•
Ranges represent the significant unobservable inputs that were used in the valuation of each type of trading cash instrument.
•
Weighted averages are calculated by weighting each input by the relative fair value of the trading cash instruments.
•
The ranges and weighted averages of these inputs are not representative of the appropriate inputs to use when calculating the fair value of any one trading cash instrument. For example, the highest recovery rate for corporate debt instruments is appropriate for valuing a specific corporate debt instrument, but may not be appropriate for valuing any other corporate debt instrument. Accordingly, the ranges of inputs do not represent uncertainty in, or possible ranges of, fair value measurements of level 3 trading cash instruments.
•
Increases in yield or duration used in the valuation of level 3 trading cash instruments would have resulted in a lower fair value measurement, while an increase in recovery rate would have resulted in a higher fair value measurement as of both March 2025 and December 2024. Due to the distinctive nature of each level 3 trading cash instrument, the interrelationship of inputs is not necessarily uniform within each product type.
•
Trading cash instruments are valued using discounted cash flows.
