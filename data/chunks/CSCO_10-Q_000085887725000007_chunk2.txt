Organization and Basis of Presentation
The fiscal year for Cisco Systems, Inc. (the “Company,” “Cisco,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) is the 52 or 53 weeks ending on the last Saturday in July. Fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2024 are each 52-week fiscal years.
The Consolidated Financial Statements include our accounts and those of our subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. We conduct business globally and are primarily managed on a geographic basis in the following
three
geographic segments: the Americas; Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA); and Asia Pacific, Japan, and China (APJC).
We have prepared the accompanying financial data as of January 25, 2025 and for the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2025 and 2024, without audit, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP) have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. The July 27, 2024 Consolidated Balance Sheet was derived from audited financial statements, but does not include all disclosures required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. However, we believe that the disclosures are adequate to make the information presented not misleading. These Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended July 27, 2024.
In the opinion of management, all normal recurring adjustments necessary to state fairly the consolidated balance sheet as of January 25, 2025, the results of operations, the statements of comprehensive income and the statements of equity for the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2025 and 2024, and the statements of cash flows for the first six months of fiscal 2025 and 2024, as applicable, have been made. The results of operations for the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2025 are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for the full fiscal year or any future periods.
Our consolidated financial statements include our accounts and investments consolidated under the voting interest model. The noncontrolling interests attributed to these investments are not presented as a separate component in the equity section of the Consolidated Balance Sheets as these amounts are not material for any of
