financial statements). Sales of
Lagevrio
declined 71% in the first quarter of 2025 primarily due to lower demand in several markets in the Asia Pacific region, particularly in Japan.
Immunology
Simponi
(golimumab) and
Remicade
(infliximab) are treatments for certain inflammatory diseases that the Company marketed in Europe, Russia and Türkiye. The Company’s marketing rights with respect to these products reverted to Johnson & Johnson on October 1, 2024, subsequent to which the Company is no longer recognizing sales of these products.
Diabetes
Worldwide combined sales of
Januvia
and
Janumet
, medicines that help lower blood sugar levels in adults with type 2 diabetes, increased 19% in the first quarter of 2025 primarily due to higher net pricing in the U.S., including a favorable true-up to customer discounts, partially offset by the ongoing impact of the loss of exclusivity in most international markets, as well as continuing volume declines in the U.S. due to competitive pressure.
The American Rescue Plan Act enacted in the U.S. in 2021 included a provision that eliminated the statutory c
ap on rebates drug manufacturers pay to Medicaid beginning in January 2024. As a result of this provision, the Company paid state Medicaid programs more in rebates than it received on Medicaid sales of
Januvia
,
Janumet
and
Janumet
XR in 2024.
In early 2025, Merck lowered the list price of the
Januvia
family of products to more closely align them with net prices. The lower list price has reduced the rebate amount Merck pays to Medicaid, resulting in higher realized net pricing. The Company expects higher U.S. net sales of these products for full year 2025 compared with full year 2024.
While the key U.S. patent for
Januvia
,
Janumet
and
Janumet
XR claiming the sitagliptin compound expired in January 2023, as a result of favorable court rulings and settlement agreements related to a later expiring patent directed to the specific sitagliptin salt form of the products (see Note 7 to the condensed consolidated financial statements), the Company expects that
Januvia
and
Janumet
will not lose market exclusivity in the U.S. until May 2026 and
Janumet XR
will not lose market exclusivity in the U.S. until July 2026, although
a non-automatically substitutable form of sitagliptin that differs from the form in the Company’s sitagliptin products has been approved by the FDA
. Additionally, in 2023, the U.S. Department of HHS, through the CMS, announced that
Januvia
would be included in the first year of the IRA’s Program. Pursuant to the IRA’s Program, a government price was set for
Januvia
, which will become effective on January 1, 2026. Also, in January 2025, the U.S. Department of HHS, through the CMS, announced that
Janumet
and
Janumet XR
would be in included in the second year of the IRA’s Program, with government price setting to become effective on January 1, 2027. The Company has sued the U.S. government regarding the IRA’s Program. As a result of the anticipated
