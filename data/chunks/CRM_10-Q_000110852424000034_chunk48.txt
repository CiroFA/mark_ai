The net cash used in financing activities during the nine months ended October 31, 2023 was primarily related to $5.9 billion used for repurchases of common stock and $1.2 billion related to repayments of debt, partially offset by $1.1 billion from proceeds from equity plans.
Debt
As of October 31, 2024, we had senior unsecured debt outstanding, with maturities starting in April 2028 and extending through July 2061 with a total carrying value of $8.4 billion. We were in compliance with all debt covenants as of October 31, 2024.
In October 2024, we entered into a Credit Agreement with the lenders and issuing lenders party thereto, and Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent (the “Revolving Loan Credit Agreement”). The Revolving Loan Credit Agreement replaced the Credit Agreement, dated December 23, 2020 (as amended, the “Prior Credit Agreement”), among us, the lenders and the issuing lenders party thereto, and Citibank, N.A., as administrative agent, which provided for a $3.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility that was scheduled to mature on December 23, 2025. There were no outstanding borrowings under the Prior Credit Agreement.
