Credit risk management
Credit risk is the risk associated with the default or change in credit profile of a client, counterparty or customer. The Firm provides credit to a variety of clients and customers, ranging from large corporate and institutional clients to individual consumers and small businesses. In its consumer businesses, the Firm is exposed to credit risk primarily through its home lending, credit card, auto, and business banking businesses. In its wholesale businesses, the Firm is exposed to credit risk through its underwriting, lending, market-making, and hedging activities with and for clients and counterparties, as well as through its operating services activities (such as cash management and clearing activities), and securities financing activities. The Firm is also exposed to credit risk through its investment securities portfolio and cash placed with banks.
Credit Risk Management monitors and measures credit risk throughout the Firm, and defines credit risk policies, procedures and limits. The Firm’s credit risk management governance includes the following activities:
•
Maintaining a credit risk policy framework
•
Monitoring and measuring credit risk across all portfolio segments, including transaction and exposure approval
•
Setting industry and geographic concentration limits, as appropriate, and setting guidelines for credit review and analysis
•
Assigning and maintaining credit approval authorities in connection with the approval of credit exposure
•
Monitoring and independent assessment of criticized exposures and delinquent loans, and
•
Estimating credit losses and supporting appropriate credit risk-based capital management
Risk identification and measurement
To measure credit risk, the Firm employs several methodologies for estimating the likelihood of obligor or counterparty default. Methodologies for measuring credit risk vary depending on several factors, including type of asset (e.g., consumer versus wholesale), risk measurement parameters (e.g., delinquency status and borrower’s credit score versus wholesale risk-rating) and risk management and collection processes (e.g., retail collection center versus centrally managed workout groups). Credit risk measurement is based on the probability of default of an obligor or counterparty, the loss severity given a default event and the exposure at default.
Based on these factors and the methodology and estimates described in Note 13 and Note 10, the Firm estimates credit losses for its exposures. The allowance for loan losses reflects estimated credit losses related to the consumer and wholesale held-for-investment loan portfolios, the allowance for lending-related commitments reflects estimated credit losses related to the Firm’s lending-related commitments and the allowance for investment securities reflects estimated credit losses related to the investment securities portfolio. Refer to
