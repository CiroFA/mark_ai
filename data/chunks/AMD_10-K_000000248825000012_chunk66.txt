Introduction
In this section, we will describe the general financial condition and the results of operations of Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (collectively, “us,” “our” or “AMD”), including a discussion of our results of operations for 2024 compared to 2023, an analysis of changes in our financial condition and a discussion of our off-balance sheet arrangements. Discussions of 2022 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2023 and 2022 that are not included in this Form 10-K can be found in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2023.
Overview
In 2024, we delivered strong annual revenue growth with net revenue increasing 14% to $25.8 billion, compared to $22.7 billion in 2023. This growth was driven by the performance of our Data Center and Client segments. Data Center net revenue of $12.6 billion increased by 94% compared to $6.5 billion in 2023, driven by higher sales of our AMD Instinct™ GPUs and AMD EPYC™ CPUs. Client segment net revenue of $7.1 billion in 2024 increased by 52% compared to $4.7 billion in 2023, primarily due to higher sales of our AMD Ryzen™ mobile and desktop processors. The increase in annual net revenue was partially offset by a decrease in net revenue in our Gaming and Embedded segments. Gaming net revenue of $2.6 billion decreased by 58% compared to $6.2 billion in 2023. The decrease in net revenue was primarily due to lower semi-custom product revenue. Embedded net revenue of $3.6 billion decreased by 33% compared to net revenue of $5.3 billion in 2023, as customers normalized their inventory levels.
