NOTE 11.
INCOME TAXES
Earnings before income taxes shown below are based on the geographic location to which such earnings are attributable.
The provision (benefit) for income taxes consists of the following components:
A reconciliation between the Company's effective tax rate and the U.S. federal statutory rate is as follows:
The effective tax rate in fiscal 2024 and 2023 was
23.0
% and
23.1
%, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate is primarily due to a valuation allowance release and an intercompany transfer of certain assets offset by a lower benefit for adjustments to prior year tax liabilities in fiscal 2024.
The effective tax rate for fiscal 2023 and 2022 was
23.1
% and
22.5
%, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate is primarily due to an intercompany transfer of certain assets that resulted in a lower effective tax rate in fiscal 2022 and higher reserves for uncertain tax positions in fiscal 2023.
