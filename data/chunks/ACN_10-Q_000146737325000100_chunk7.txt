As of February 28, 2025, we had the following borrowing facilities:

This facility, which matures on May 14, 2029, provides unsecured, revolving borrowing capacity for general corporate purposes, including the issuance of letters of credit and short-term commercial paper. Borrowings under this facility will accrue interest at the applicable risk-free rate plus a spread. We continue to be in compliance with relevant covenant terms. The facility is subject to annual commitment fees.

We maintain separate, uncommitted and unsecured multicurrency revolving credit facilities. These facilities provide local currency financing for the majority of our operations. Interest rate terms on the revolving facilities are at market rates prevailing in the relevant local markets. As of
February 28, 2025
and
August 31, 2024
, we had
no
borrowings under these facilities.

February 28, 2025
and
August 31, 2024
, we had
no
borrowings under these various facilities.
We had an aggregate of $

and $
1,269,178
of letters of credit outstanding and $
100,000
and $
935,000

Income Taxes
We apply an estimated annual effective tax rate to our year-to-date operating results to determine the interim provision for income tax expense. In addition, we recognize taxes related to unusual or infrequent items or resulting from a change in judgment regarding a position taken in a prior year as discrete items in the interim period in which the event occurs.
Our effective tax rates for the three months ended February 28, 2025 and February 29, 2024 were
20.4
% and
18.4
%, respectively. The higher effective tax rate for the three months ended February 28, 2025 was primarily due to lower tax benefits from share-based payments. Our effective tax rate for both the six months ended February 28, 2025 and February 29, 2024 was
21.1
%.
