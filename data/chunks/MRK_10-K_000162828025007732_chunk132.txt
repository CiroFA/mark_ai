well as the ongoing impact of the loss of exclusivity in most markets in Europe, the Asia Pacific region, and in Canada.
The American Rescue Plan Act enacted in the U.S. in 2021 included a provision that eliminated the statutory c
ap on rebates drug manufacturers pay to Medicaid beginning in January 2024. As a result of this provision, the Company paid state Medicaid programs more in rebates than it received on Medicaid sales of
Januvia
,
Janumet
and
Janumet
XR in 2024.
In early 2025, Merck lowered the list price of the
Januvia
family of products to more closely align them with net prices. The lower list price will reduce the rebate amount Merck pays to Medicaid, resulting in higher realized net pricing, which will be partially offset by continuing volume declines. The Company expects higher U.S. net sales of these products in 2025 compared with 2024.
While the key U.S. patent for
Januvia
,
Janumet
and
Janumet
XR claiming the sitagliptin compound expired in January 2023, as a result of favorable court rulings and settlement agreements related to a later expiring patent directed to the specific sitagliptin salt form of the products (see Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements), the Company expects that
Januvia
and
Janumet
will not lose market exclusivity in the U.S. until May 2026 and
Janumet
XR will not lose market exclusivity in the U.S. until July 2026, although a non-automatically substitutable form of sitagliptin that differs from the form in the Company’s sitagliptin products has been approved by the FDA. Additionally, i
n
2023, the U.S. Department of HHS, through the CMS, announced that
Januvia
would be included in the first year of the IRA’s Program. Pursuant to the IRA’s Program, a government price was set for
Januvia
, which will become effective on January 1, 20
26. Also, in January 2025, the U.S. Department of HHS, through the CMS, announced that
Janumet
and
Janumet
XR would be in included in the second year of the IRA’s Program, with government price setting to become effective on January 1, 2027. The Company ha
s sued the U.S. government regarding the IRA’s Program (see Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements). As a result of
the anticipated patent expiries in 2026, the government price setting in 2026 and 2027 noted above, as well as ongoing
competitive pressures, the Company anticipates significant sales declines for
Januvia,
Janumet
and
Janumet
XR in the U.S. in 2026 and thereafter.
The Company lost market exclusivity for
Januvia
in all of the EU and for
Janumet
in some European countries in September 2022. Exclusivity for
Janumet
was lost in other European countries in April 2023. Accordingly, the Company is experiencing sales declines in these markets and expects the declines to continue. Generic equivalents of
Januvi
a and
Janumet
have also launched in China.
