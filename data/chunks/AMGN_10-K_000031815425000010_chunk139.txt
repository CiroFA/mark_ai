fair values of these contracts were a $145 million asset and a $116 million liability. As of December 31, 2024, we had primarily euro-based open foreign currency forward contracts with an aggregate notional amount of $7.2 billion. As of December 31, 2023, we had primarily euro-based open foreign currency forward contracts with an aggregate notional amount of $6.6 billion. With regard to foreign currency forward contracts that were open as of December 31, 2024, a hypothetical 20% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates as of December 31, 2024, would have resulted in a reduction in fair value of these contracts of approximately $1.3 billion on this date and in the ensuing year, a reduction in income of approximately $700 million. With regard to contracts that were open as of December 31, 2023, a hypothetical 20% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates as of December 31, 2023, would have resulted in a reduction in fair value of these contracts of approximately $1.2 billion on this date and in the ensuing year, a reduction in income of $690 million. The analysis does not consider the impact that hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates would have on anticipated transactions that these foreign-currency-sensitive instruments were designed to offset.
As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had open, short-duration, foreign currency forward contracts that mature in one month or less, that had aggregate notional amounts of $0.1 billion and $0.5 billion, respectively, and that hedged fluctuations of certain assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies but were not designated as hedges for accounting purposes. These contracts had no material net unrealized gains or losses as of December 31, 2024 and 2023. With regard to these foreign currency forward contracts that were open as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, a hypothetical 5% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates on these dates would not have a material effect on the fair values of these contracts or related income in the respective ensuing years. The analysis does not consider the impact that hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates would have on assets and liabilities that these foreign-currency-sensitive instruments were designed to offset.
