opted out of the U.S. merchant class litigation.  In 2023, we recorded charges of $539 million, primarily as a result of changes in the estimate related to the claims of merchants who opted out of the U.S. merchant class litigation and settlements with a number of U.K. and Pan-European merchants.  In 2022, we recorded charges of $356 million, primarily as a result of settlements (both final and agreements in principle) with a number of U.K. merchants and a change in estimate related to the claims of merchants who opted out of the U.S. merchant class litigation.  See Note 21 (Legal and Regulatory Proceedings) to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 for further discussion.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Income Taxes
The effective income tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 were 15.6% and 17.9%, respectively.  The adjusted effective income tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 were 16.2% and 18.5%, respectively.  Both the as-reported and as-adjusted effective income tax rates were lower in 2024, primarily due to a discrete tax expense in 2023 related to changes in the valuation allowance associated with the U.S. foreign tax credits deferred tax asset.  In 2023, the treatment of foreign taxes paid under the U.S. tax regulations published in 2022 changed due to the foreign tax legislation enacted in Brazil and Notice 2023-55 (the “Notice”) released by the U.S. Department of Treasury.  Therefore, we recognized a total $327 million discrete tax expense in 2023 to establish the valuation allowance.  This discrete tax expense was partially offset by our ability to claim more U.S. foreign tax credits generated in 2022 and 2023 due to the Notice.  Additionally, a change in our geographic mix of earnings in 2024 contributed to the lower effective income tax rates compared to the prior year.
The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”) Pillar 2 guidelines published to date include transition and safe harbor rules around the implementation of the 15% global minimum tax (the “Pillar 2 Rules”).  In 2024, we did not experience a material impact as a result of Pillar 2 Rules.  However, in 2025, we expect the Pillar 2 Rules will primarily offset the reduction to our effective income tax rate resulting from our incentive grant received from the Singapore Ministry of Finance.  For the year ended December 31, 2024, this incentive grant reduced our effective income tax rate by approximately 4%.  We are continuously monitoring developments and evaluating the impacts these new rules may have on our future effective
