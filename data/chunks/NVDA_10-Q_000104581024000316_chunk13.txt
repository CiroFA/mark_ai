Investments in Non-Affiliated Entities
Our investments in non-affiliated entities include non-marketable equity securities, which are primarily investments in privately held companies. Beginning in the second quarter of fiscal year 2025, publicly-held equity securities from investments in non-affiliated entities were classified in marketable securities on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Our non-marketable equity securities are recorded in long-term other assets on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets and valued under the measurement alternative. Gains and losses on these investments, realized and unrealized, are recognized in Other income and expense, net on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income.
