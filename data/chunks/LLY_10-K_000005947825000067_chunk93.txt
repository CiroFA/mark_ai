AND LIQUIDITY
We believe our available cash and cash equivalents, together with our ability to generate operating cash flow and our access to short-term and long-term borrowings, are sufficient to fund our existing and planned capital requirements, which include:
•
working capital requirements, including related to employee payroll and benefits, clinical trials, manufacturing materials, and taxes;
•
capital expenditures;
•
share repurchases and dividends;
•
repayment of outstanding short-term and long-term borrowings;
•
milestone and royalty payments;
•
potential business development activities, including acquisitions, collaborations, investments, and licensing arrangements; and
•
contributions to our defined benefit pension and retiree health benefit plans.
Our management continuously evaluates our liquidity and capital resources, including our access to external capital, to ensure we can adequately and efficiently finance our capital requirements. As of December 31, 2024, our material cash requirements primarily related to purchases of goods and services to produce our products and conduct our operations, income tax payments, capital expenditures, dividends, milestone and royalty payments, business development activities, share repurchases and repayment of outstanding borrowings (see Notes 14, 4, 3, 13, and 11 to the consolidated financial statements). We anticipate our cash requirements related to ordinary course purchases of goods and services will be consistent with our past levels relative to revenues.
Capital expenditures were $5.06 billion during 2024, compared to $3.45 billion in 2023. We are making investments in global facilities to manufacture existing and future products. These investments, and other capital investments that support our operations, have increased our capital expenditures and will result in meaningfully higher capital expenditures over the next several years.
As we expand our manufacturing capacity in order to meet existing and expected demand of our medicines, we have entered, and expect to continue to enter, into various agreements for contract manufacturing and for supply of materials. The executed agreements could, under certain circumstances, require us to pay up to approximately $14 billion if we do not purchase specified amounts of goods or services primarily related to our incretin medicines, including medicines in development, over the durations of the agreements, which are generally up to 8 years.
Cash and cash equivalents increased to $3.27 billion as of December 31, 2024, compared with $2.82 billion at December 31, 2023. Net cash provided by operating activities increased to $8.82 billion in 2024, compared with $4.24 billion in 2023. Refer to the consolidated statements of cash flows for additional information on the significant sources and uses of cash for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023.
In addition to our cash and cash equivalents, we held total investments of $3.37 billion and $3.16 billion
