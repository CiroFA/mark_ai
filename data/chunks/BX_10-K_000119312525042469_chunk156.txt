Realizations.
Our Private Equity segment demonstrated resilience across all strategies in 2024. In addition to particular strength in Corporate Private Equity and Life Sciences, our Infrastructure business was a notable driver of Fee Related Performance Revenues in the fourth quarter due to a significant scheduled crystallization event. We continue to believe our Infrastructure business is well positioned to benefit from the expected increase in demand for investment in infrastructure, including digital infrastructure, over time. In Corporate Private Equity, our operating companies saw stable revenue growth and margin expansion during the year. Realization activity in the segment meaningfully increased toward the end of 2024, concentrated in Corporate Private Equity, and we see a more constructive environment for realizations in the segment through the course of 2025. Improved market sentiment has created positive momentum for deployment in the segment, which nearly doubled year-over-year, and for fundraising, including in our perpetual capital strategies.
