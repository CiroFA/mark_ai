Therefore, eBazar.com.br Ltda. and Mercado Pago Instituição de Pagamento Ltda., filed writs of mandamus to the
27
Federation States, aimed at preventing the Brazilian tax authorities demand payments of the DIFAL. In this regard, the Brazilian Supreme Court (“STF”) has issued a decision regarding the constitutionality of the supplementary Law on November 29, 2023. In the judgment, the majority of STF judges considered the supplementary Law No. 190/22 to be constitutional, therefore, the ICMS-DIFAL is due from April 5, 2022, due to the corresponding time lapse of ninety days between the law enacting and the beginning of the charge. The decision has not yet become final and unappealable and a motion to clarify was presented on May 13, 2024. However, such motion to clarify is unlikely to change the merit of the decision. Management’s opinion, based on the opinion of external legal counsel, is that the risk of losing the case is remote for the period between January 1, 2022 to April 4, 2022, and probable for the period between April 5, 2022 to December 31, 2022 based on the technical merits of the Company’s tax position. For that reason, the Company has not recorded any liability for the controversial amounts related to the period through April 4, 2022, and has recorded liabilities for the disputed amounts related to the period from April 5, 2022 to December 31, 2022, by $
27
million, which are presented net of the corresponding judicial deposits of $
24
million.
Interstate rate of ICMS-DIFAL over fixed assets
From April to September 2022, the Brazilian subsidiary Mercado Envios Serviços de Logística Ltda., now incorporated by eBazar.com.br Ltda., also filed writs of mandamus to
3
Federation States (São Paulo, Santa Catarina and Bahia), for the purpose of preventing the Brazilian tax authorities from demanding payment of the DIFAL over their respective fixed assets not explicitly addressed by the supplementary Law No. 190/22. Regarding this topic, the STF has not expressly pointed to the principle of anticipation. Therefore, there are two controversies regarding DIFAL over fixed assets: (i) if DIFAL is applicable under the previous supplementary Law No. 87/96, and (ii) if supplementary Law No. 87/96 is deemed not applicable, if the new supplementary Law No. 190/22 needs to comply with the principle of anticipation. In this last controversy, the same decision above mentioned applies to the Brazilian subsidiary Mercado Envios Serviços de Logística Ltda., and its writs of mandamus. Therefore, Management’s opinion, based on the opinion of external legal counsel, is that the risk of losing the case is reasonably possible for the period between January 1, 2022 to April 4, 2022, and probable for the period between April 5, 2022 to December 31, 2022 based on the technical merits of the Company’s tax position. For that reason, the Company has not recorded any liability for the controversial amounts related to the period until April 4, 2022, and has recorded
