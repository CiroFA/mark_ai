Knowledge-based economy promotional regime in Argentina
In August 2021, the Under Secretariat of Knowledge Economy issued the Disposition 316/2021 approving MercadoLibre S.R.L.’s application for eligibility under the knowledge-based economy promotional regime, established by the Law No. 27,506 and complemented by Argentina’s Executive Power Decree No. 1034/2020, Argentina’s Ministry of Productive Development’s Resolution No. 4/2021 and the Under Secretariat of Knowledge Economy’s Disposition No. 11/2021.
Based on the promotional regime, companies that meet specified criteria shall be entitled to: i) a reduction of the income tax burden over the promoted activities for each fiscal year, ii) stability of the benefits established by the knowledge-based economy promotional regime, and iii) a tax credit bond on the Company’s contribution to the social security regime of every employee whose job is related to the promoted activities.

70
% of the Company´s social security contributions for those employees whose jobs are related to the promoted activities, with a salary cap which has been reduced to the indicated limit. MercadoLibre S.R.L uses the tax credit bond to offset federal taxes.
As a result, the Company recorded an income tax benefit of $
33
million, $
42
million and $

million, during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The aggregate per share effect of the income tax benefit amounted to $
