Marketable Securities
Total balances were $6.8 billion and $8.2 billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The company holds its cash with a diverse group of major financial institutions and has processes and safeguards in place designed to manage its cash balances and mitigate the risk of loss. Cash provided by operating activities in 2024 was $31.5 billion, compared to $35.6 billion in 2023, primarily due to lower earnings and higher payments related to asset retirement obligations. Cash provided by operating activities was net of contributions to employee pension plans of approximately $844 million in 2024 and $1.1 billion in 2023. Capital expenditures totaled $16.4 billion in 2024 compared to $15.8 billion in 2023. Proceeds and deposits related to asset sales and return of investments totaled $7.7 billion in 2024 compared to $669 million in 2023 primarily related to proceeds from asset sales in Canada. Cash flow from financing activities includes proceeds from shares issued for stock options of $330 million in 2024, compared with $261 million in 2023.
Restricted cash of $1.5 billion and $1.1 billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, was held in cash and short-term marketable securities and recorded as “Deferred charges and other assets” and “Prepaid expenses and other current assets” on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. These amounts are generally associated with upstream decommissioning activities, tax payments and funds held in escrow for tax-deferred exchanges. The increase of restricted cash in 2024 is mainly due to increase in funds for tax-deferred exchanges.
Dividends
Dividends paid to common stockholders were $11.8 billion in 2024 and $11.3 billion in 2023.
Debt and Finance Lease Liabilities
Total debt and finance lease liabilities were $24.5 billion at December 31, 2024, up from $20.8 billion at year-end 2023 as the company issued commercial paper and tax-exempt bonds and retired public bonds.
The $3.7 billion increase in total debt and finance lease liabilities during 2024 was primarily due to the issuance of commercial paper. The company’s debt and finance lease liabilities due within one year, consisting primarily of the current portion of long-term debt and redeemable long-term obligations, totaled $12.7 billion at December 31, 2024, compared with $5.1 billion at year-end 2023. Of these amounts, $8.3 billion and $4.5 billion were reclassified to long-term debt at the end of 2024 and 2023, respectively, since settlement of these obligations was not expected to require the use of working capital within one year, as the company had the intent and the ability, as evidenced by committed credit facilities, to continue refinancing them.
The company has access to a commercial paper program as a financing source for working capital or other short-term needs. The company had $5.4 billion of commercial paper outstanding as of December 31, 2024, and there was no commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2023.
