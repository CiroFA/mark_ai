bitcoin trading price fluctuations, and held $38.1 million in cash and cash equivalents. At December 31, 2023, we carried $3.626 billion of digital assets on our balance sheet, consisting of approximately 189,150 bitcoins and reflecting $2.269 billion in cumulative impairment losses attributable to bitcoin trading price fluctuations, and held $46.8 million in cash and cash equivalents. On January 1, 2025, we adopted Accounting Standards Update No. 2023-08,
Intangibles—Goodwill and Other—Crypto Assets (Subtopic 350-60): Accounting for and Disclosure of Crypto Assets
(“ASU 2023-08”). ASU 2023-08 requires us to measure our bitcoin holdings at fair value in our statement of financial position, with gains and losses from changes in the fair value of our bitcoin recognized in net income each reporting period. As a result of our adoption of ASU 2023-08, as of January 1, 2025, we are required to apply a cumulative-effect net increase to the opening balance of our retained earnings of $12.745 billion.
As of February 14, 2025, we held approximately 478,740 bitcoins that were acquired at an aggregate purchase price of $31.134 billion and an average purchase price of approximately $65,033 per bitcoin, inclusive of fees and expenses. As of February 14, 2025, at 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time, the market price of one bitcoin reported on the Coinbase exchange (our principal market) was $97,236.98.
Overview of the Bitcoin Industry and Market
Bitcoin is a digital asset that is issued by and transmitted through an open-source protocol, known as the Bitcoin protocol, collectively maintained by a peer-to-peer network of decentralized user nodes. This network hosts a public transaction ledger, known as the Bitcoin blockchain, on which bitcoin holdings and all validated transactions that have ever taken place on the Bitcoin network are recorded.  Balances of bitcoin are stored in individual “wallet” functions, which associate network public addresses with one or more “private keys” that control the transfer of bitcoin. The Bitcoin blockchain can be updated without any single entity owning or operating the network.
Creation of New Bitcoin and Limits on Supply
The Bitcoin protocol limits the total number of bitcoins that can be generated over time to 21 million. As of February 14, 2025, approximately 20.0 million bitcoins have been generated. New bitcoins are created and allocated by the Bitcoin protocol through a “mining” process that rewards users that validate transactions in the Bitcoin blockchain.  Validated transactions are added in “blocks” approximately every 10 minutes. The mining process serves to validate transactions and secure the Bitcoin network. Mining is a competitive and costly operation that requires a large amount of computational power to solve complex mathematical algorithms.  This expenditure of computing power is known as “proof of work.”
To incentivize miners to incur the costs of mining bitcoin, the Bitcoin protocol rewards miners that successfully
