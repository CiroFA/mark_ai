National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity (“NIST”) Framework to evaluate our program, and we engage third-parties for assistance and to independently assess, proactively monitor, and provide an external view of our cybersecurity program. We conduct risk assessments and tabletop exercises to evaluate the effectiveness of our systems and processes in addressing cybersecurity threats, including threats associated with our use of third-party service providers, and to identify areas for improvements. Our cybersecurity risk management program is integrated with our enterprise risk management (“ERM”) program, and information about cybersecurity risks and our cybersecurity risk management program is reviewed as part of our ERM program, sharing common risk governance and reporting processes that apply across our ERM program.
While we are not aware of having directly experienced a cybersecurity incident that has materially impacted our business, financial condition or results of operations, we face risks from cybersecurity threats that, if realized, could reasonably likely materially affect us, our business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition.
See “Risk Factors - Operational and Financial Risks – We are exposed to cybersecurity threats and incidents” for additional information about cybersecurity related risks.
Governance
Our Board of Directors is responsible for overseeing the assessment of major risks facing us, and its Audit Committee oversees our ERM program, including oversight of cybersecurity risks and of our cybersecurity risk management program. The Audit Committee receives quarterly reports from management on our cybersecurity risks and cybersecurity risk management program, and our management regularly updates the Chair of the Audit Committee regarding cybersecurity incidents where appropriate in accordance with our cybersecurity incident response plan and escalation protocols. The Audit Committee reports to the full Board regarding its activities, including those related to cybersecurity, and management reports to the full Board on our cybersecurity risks and cybersecurity risk management program at least annually.
Our management has day-to-day responsibility for assessing and managing material risks from cybersecurity threats, including implementing risk mitigation plans, processes and controls, and managing our cybersecurity risk management program. Our Chief Information Security Officer (“CISO”), who has more than 20 years of experience in information security management, is primarily responsible for managing our cybersecurity risk management program, cybersecurity incident response plan and escalation protocols, and reports at least quarterly to the Audit Committee and at least annually to the full Board on our cybersecurity, data and intellectual property security programs, policies, risks and controls. The CISO reports to our Chief Information Officer (“CIO”), who has more than 30 years of experience
