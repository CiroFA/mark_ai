The future payments from such arrangements are not included in the above table as they are a function of the power generated by the related solar energy systems in the future.

Equity Incentive Plans
In June 2019, we adopted the 2019 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2019 Plan”). The 2019 Plan provides for the grant of stock options, restricted stock, RSUs, stock appreciation rights, performance units and performance shares to our employees, directors and consultants. Stock options granted under the 2019 Plan may be either incentive stock options or nonstatutory stock options. Incentive stock options may only be granted to our employees. Nonstatutory stock options may be granted to our employees, directors and consultants. Generally, our stock options and RSUs vest over
four years
and our stock options are exercisable over a maximum period of
10
years from their grant dates. Vesting typically terminates when the employment or consulting relationship ends.
As of December 31, 2024,
113.0
million shares were reserved and available for issuance under the 2019 Plan.
