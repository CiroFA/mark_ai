Significant components of our deferred tax assets and liabilities consisted of the following:
As a result of the acquisition of VMware, we established $
3,642
million of net deferred tax liabilities on the excess of book basis over the tax basis of acquired assets. Our net deferred tax liabilities also increased during the year due to the non-recurring intra-group transfer of certain IP rights to the United States. The valuation allowance disclosed in the table above relates to substantially all U.S. state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards and research and development tax credits that may not be realized.
We continue to indefinitely reinvest $
1,785
million of certain accumulated foreign earnings. The unrecognized deferred income tax liability related to these earnings is estimated to be $
187
million. All other current and future earnings of all our foreign subsidiaries are not considered permanently reinvested.
As of November 3, 2024, we had tax effected U.S. state net operating loss carryforwards of $
126
million and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $
92
million, all of which expire in various years beginning in fiscal year 2025. We had $

We recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for income taxes. Accrued interest and penalties were included within other long-term liabilities. During fiscal years 2024, 2023 and 2022, we recognized interest and penalties of $
144
million, $
22
million and $
25
million respectively, within the provision for income taxes. As of November 3, 2024 and October 29, 2023, the total accrued interest and penalties was approximately $
701
million and $
389
million, respectively. The increase in total accrued interest and penalties was primarily the result of the VMware acquisition in addition to the current year accrual.
As of November 3, 2024 and October 29, 2023, approximately $
6,544
million and $
5,044
million, respectively, of the unrecognized tax benefits and accrued interest and penalties would, if recognized, benefit our effective income tax rate. We are subject to U.S. income tax examination for fiscal years 2018 and later. Certain of our acquired companies are subject to tax examinations
