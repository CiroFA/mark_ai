investing activities increased $2.1 billion in 2024 versus the prior year, primarily due to cash paid for business acquisitions in the current year, partially offset by a net decrease in purchases of investments in time deposits.
Net cash used in financing activities increased $1.3 billion in 2024 versus the prior year, primarily due to higher cash paid for repurchases of our Class A common stock, dividends, and repayments of debt, partially offset by an increase in cash proceeds received from debt issuances.
Debt and Credit Availability
In April 2024, $1 billion of principal related to the 2014 USD Notes matured and was paid.  In July 2024, INR28.1 billion ($336 million as of payment date) of principal related to the 2023 INR Term Loan matured and was paid.
During 2024, we issued a total of $4 billion of debt, as follows:

In May 2024, we issued $1 billion principal amount of notes due May 2034
•
In September 2024, we issued $750 million principal amount of notes due January 2028, $1,150 million principal amount of notes due January 2032 and $1,100 million principal amount of notes due January 2035
The issuances in 2024 are collectively referred to as the “2024 USD Notes”.  The net proceeds from the issuance of the 2024 USD Notes, after deducting the original issue discount, underwriting discount and offering expenses, were $3.96 billion.
Our total debt outstanding was $18.2 billion at December 31, 2024, with the earliest maturity of $750 million of principal occurring in March 2025.
As of December 31, 2024, we have a commercial paper program (the “Commercial Paper Program”), under which we are authorized to issue up to $8 billion in outstanding notes, with maturities up to 397 days from the date of issuance.  In conjunction with the Commercial Paper Program, we have a committed unsecured $8 billion revolving credit facility (the “Credit Facility”) that expires in November 2029.
Borrowings under the Commercial Paper Program and the Credit Facility are to be used to provide liquidity for general corporate purposes, including providing liquidity in the event of one or more settlement failures by our customers.  In addition, we may borrow and repay amounts under these facilities for business continuity purposes.  We had no borrowings outstanding under the Commercial Paper Program or the Credit Facility at December 31, 2024.
See Note 15 (Debt) to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 for further discussion on our debt, the Commercial Paper Program and the Credit Facility.
