2025 and December 31, 2024, 5% and 6%, respectively, of our portfolio was allocated to Group I securities with the remainder to Group II securities.
Our recurring investment income generated a pretax book yield of 4.1% for the first quarter 2025, compared to 3.7% for the same period in 2024. The increase from prior year primarily reflected investing new cash from insurance operations, and proceeds from maturing bonds, in higher coupon rate securities. Our investment portfolio produced a fully taxable equivalent (FTE) total return of 2.2% and 0.8% for the first quarter 2025 and 2024, respectively. Our fixed-income and common stock portfolios had FTE total returns of 2.5% and (5.0)%, respectively, for the first quarter 2025, compared to 0.3% and 9.9%, respectively, last year. The increase in the fixed-income portfolio FTE total return primarily reflected movements in Treasury yields year-over-year. The decrease in the common stock portfolio FTE total return reflected general market conditions.

At March 31, 2025 and 2024, and December 31, 2024, the fixed-income portfolio had a weighted average credit quality of AA-. At March 31, 2025, the fixed-income portfolio duration was 3.4 years, compared to 3.2 years at March 31, 2024, and 3.3 years at December 31, 2024. During 2025, we increased our duration to take advantage of higher yields in the market.
At March 31, 2025, we continued to maintain a relatively conservative investment portfolio with a greater allocation to cash and treasuries. We believe that this portfolio allocation positions us well to benefit from the continuing dynamic market environment. We believe that we are in a very strong position as we move into the second quarter of 2025.
II.  FINANCIAL CONDITION
A. Liquidity and Capital Resources
Progressive’s insurance operations create liquidity by collecting and investing premiums from new and renewal business in advance of paying claims, as well as our insurance subsidiaries producing aggregate calendar-year underwriting profits and positive cash flows. As primarily an auto insurer, our claims liabilities generally have a short-term duration.
Operations generated positive cash flows of $5.1 billion and $4.2 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively. The increase in operating cash flow for the first three months of 2025, compared to the same period last year, was in part driven by the growth in profit from our underwriting operations. We believe cash flows will remain positive in the foreseeable future and do not expect we will need to raise capital to support our operations in that timeframe, although changes in market or regulatory conditions affecting the insurance industry, or other unforeseen events, may necessitate otherwise.
As of March 31, 2025, we held $46.9 billion in short-term investments and U.S. Treasury securities, which represented 56% of our total portfolio at quarter end. Based on our portfolio allocation and investment strategies, we
