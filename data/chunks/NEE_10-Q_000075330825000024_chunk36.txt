with the trailing twelve months regulatory retail base net operating income, which primarily includes the retail base portion of base and other revenues, net of O&M, depreciation and amortization, interest and tax expenses. In general, the net impact of these income statement line items must be adjusted, in part, by reserve amortization to earn the targeted regulatory ROE. In certain periods, reserve amortization is reversed so as not to exceed the targeted regulatory ROE. The drivers of FPL's net income not reflected in the reserve amortization calculation typically include wholesale and transmission service revenues and expenses, cost recovery clause revenues and expenses, AFUDC – equity and revenue and costs not recoverable from retail customers. During the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, FPL recorded reserve amortization of $622 million and $572 million, respectively. See Depreciation and Amortization Expense below. FPL earned an approximately 11.60% and 11.80% regulatory ROE on its retail rate base, based on a trailing thirteen-month average retail rate base as of March 31, 2025 and March 31, 2024, respectively.
In January 2025, FPL began recovering eligible storm costs and replenishment of the storm reserve through a storm surcharge totaling approximately $1.2 billion, related to Hurricanes Debby, Helene and Milton which impacted FPL's service area in 2024. The amount is being collected over a 12-month period and is subject to refund based on an FPSC prudence review. See Note 10 – Storm Cost Recovery.
On February 28, 2025, FPL filed a petition with the FPSC requesting, among other things, approval of a four-year base rate plan that would begin in January 2026 replacing the 2021 rate agreement. See Note 10 – FPL 2025 Base Rate Proceeding.
In March 2024, the FPSC issued a supplemental final order regarding FPL’s 2021 rate agreement. An April 2024 appeal of the order filed with the Florida Supreme Court by certain intervenors remains pending. See Note 10

FPL 2021 Rate Agreement.
Operating Revenues
During the three months ended March 31, 2025, operating revenues increased $163 million primarily reflecting an increase in storm cost recovery revenues of approximately $118 million primarily associated with Hurricanes Debby, Helene and Milton, as discussed above. Additionally, retail base revenues increased approximately $86 million during the three months ended March 31, 2025 primarily related to an increase of 1.8% in the average number of customer accounts. The increases in operating revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2025 were partly offset by a decrease in fuel revenues of approximately $117 million primarily related to lower fuel rates.
Fuel, Purchased Power and Interchange Expense
Fuel, purchased power and interchange expense decreased $98 million for the three months ended March 31, 2025 primarily reflecting lower amortization of deferred fuel costs as compared to the prior year period.
