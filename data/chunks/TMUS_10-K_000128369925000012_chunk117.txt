The fair value of the wireless reporting unit was estimated using a market approach, which is based on market capitalization. In addition to performing an assessment under the market approach we also considered any events or change in circumstances that occurred, noting no indication that the fair value of the wireless reporting unit may be below its carrying amount at December 31, 2024.
