Adoption of New Accounting Standard
Eaton adopted Accounting Standards Update 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures, in the fourth quarter of 2024 on a retrospective basis. This accounting standard requires additional segment disclosures on an annual and interim basis, including significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker. The standard does not change how operating segments and reportable segments are determined. The adoption of the standard did not have a material impact on the condensed consolidated financial statements.

In December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures (ASU 2023-09). This accounting standard requires disaggregated income tax disclosures on an annual basis, including information on the Company’s effective income tax rate reconciliation and income taxes paid. ASU 2023-09 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2024, and may be applied prospectively or retrospectively.
