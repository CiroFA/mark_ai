revenue was driven by an increase in Data Center segment revenue primarily driven by growth in AMD EPYC™ CPU and AMD Instinct™ GPU sales, and an increase in Client and Gaming segment revenue primarily driven by strong demand for the latest “Zen 5” AMD Ryzen™ processors and a richer mix, partially offset by a decrease in semi-custom revenue. Embedded segment revenue decreased as demand in end markets remained mixed.
Gross margin for the three months ended March 29, 2025 was 50% compared to gross margin of 47% for the prior year period. The increase in gross margin was driven by higher Data Center segment revenue and a richer mix of Ryzen processor sales.
Operating income for the three months ended March 29, 2025 was $806 million compared to operating income of $36 million for the prior year period. Net income for the three months ended March 29, 2025 was $709 million compared to net income of $123 million for the prior year period. The increase in operating and net income was primarily driven by higher revenue and gross margin, and lower amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, partially offset by increased operating expenses.
