including regulatory actions and inaction by the FDA, may have a material adverse impact on our commercialization of SFPs and business. The FDAâ€™s premarket tobacco product and modified risk tobacco product authorizations of two versions of our
IQOS
product as well as the premarket tobacco authorizations of 20 varieties of
ZYN
nicotine pouches are subject to strict marketing, reporting and other requirements. Although we have received these authorizations from the FDA, there is no guarantee that the products will remain authorized for sale in the United States, or that new versions of
IQOS
or other
ZYN
products will receive necessary authorizations, particularly if there is a significant uptake in youth or non-nicotine user initiation.
Moreover, we also submitted additional premarket tobacco applications for other
ZYN
products The FDA has not issued a decision on these applications, and these
ZYN
products are not presently marketed in the United States. In April 2024, we also submitted MRTPAs for
ZYN
products currently marketed in the U.S. and requested authorization of the modified risk claim. In February 2025, the FDA formally accepted our MRTPAs.
The commercialization of our products in the United States is dependent on successfully managing compliance with federal, state, and local laws, regulations, legal agreements, and related interpretations. Failure to successfully manage compliance and to resolve any disputes that may arise regarding the application of legal and administrative requirements to our products could negatively impact the timing, manner, or success of our SFP commercialization in the United States, which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, revenues, cash flows, or profitability.

The financial and business performance of our smoke-free products is less predictable than our cigarette business.
Our SFPs are novel products in a relatively new category, and the pace at which adult smokers adopt them may vary, depending on the competitive, regulatory, fiscal and cultural environment, and other factors in a specific market. There may be periods of accelerated growth and periods of slower growth for these products, the timing and drivers of which may be more difficult for us to predict versus our mature cigarette business. The impact of this lower predictability on our projected results for a specific period may be significant, due to geopolitical or macroeconomic events that negatively impact SFP availability or adoption, which in turn may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
We may be unsuccessful in our efforts to differentiate smoke-free products and cigarettes with respect to taxation.
To date, we have been largely successful in demonstrating to regulators that our SFPs are not cigarettes due to the absence of combustion, and accordingly they are generally taxed either as a separate category or as other tobacco products, which typically yields
