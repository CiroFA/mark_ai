Per Common Share Information

3.3
million shares and
4.1
million shares for the quarters ended March 31, 2025 and March 31, 2024, respectively. Share-based compensation awards that would have been antidilutive, and therefore were not included in the calculation of diluted weighted-average shares, totaled
2.2
million shares and
2.1
million shares for the quarters ended March 31, 2025 and March 31, 2024, respectively.
