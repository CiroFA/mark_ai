At December 31, 2024, CET1 capital was $201.1 billion, an increase of $6.2 billion from December 31, 2023, primarily due to earnings, partially offset by capital distributions. Tier 1 capital increased $135 million primarily driven by the increase in CET1 capital, partially offset by preferred stock redemptions. Total capital under the Standardized approach increased $4.0 billion primarily due to an increase in subordinated debt, adjusted allowance  for  credit  losses  included  in Tier 2 capital, and the
increase in Tier 1 capital. RWA under  the Standardized approach, which yielded the lower CET1 capital ratio at December 31, 2024, increased $44.5 billion during 2024 to $1,696 billion primarily driven by client activity in
Global Markets
and lending activity in
GWIM, Global Banking
and
Consumer Banking
. Supplementary leverage exposure at December 31, 2024 increased $142.0 billion primarily driven by increased activity in
Global Markets
and
ALM activities in

Bank of America, N.A. Regulatory Capital
Table 13 presents regulatory capital information for BANA in accordance with Basel 3 Standardized and Advanced approaches as measured at December 31, 2024 and 2023. BANA met the definition of well capitalized under the PCA framework for both periods.
(1)
Capital ratios as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 are calculated using the regulatory capital rule that allows a five-year transition period related to the adoption of the CECL accounting standard on January 1, 2020.
(2)
Risk-based capital regulatory minimums at both December 31, 2024 and 2023 are the minimum ratios under Basel 3 including a capital conservation buffer of 2.5 percent. The regulatory minimums for the leverage ratios as of both period ends are the percent required to be considered well capitalized under the PCA framework.
(3)
Total capital under the Advanced approaches differs from the Standardized approach due to differences in the amount permitted in Tier 2 capital related to the qualifying allowance for credit losses.
(4)
Reflects total average assets adjusted for certain Tier 1 capital deductions.
