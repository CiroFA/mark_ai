In December 2024, we obtained European certification in accordance with the EU MDR for our E-200 generator. In July 2023, we received regulatory clearance for our E-200 generator in Japan and South Korea. In November 2022, we obtained FDA clearance for our E-200 generator. The E-200 generator can be used in da Vinci robotic procedures, as well as non-robotic open and laparoscopic procedures, to deliver high-frequency energy for cutting, coagulation, and vessel sealing of tissues. The E-200 generator includes the same advanced energy capability as the E-100 generator and supports the same vessel sealing instruments.

In October 2024, we obtained regulatory clearance in South Korea for our da Vinci 5 surgical system, our next-generation multi-port robotic system, for use in urologic, general, gynecologic, thoracoscopic, thoracoscopically-assisted cardiotomy, and transoral otolaryngology surgical procedures. In March 2024, we obtained FDA clearance for our da Vinci 5 surgical system for use in all surgical specialties and procedures indicated for da Vinci Xi, except for cardiac and pediatric indications as well as one contraindication related to the use of force feedback in hysterectomy and myomectomy surgical procedures. We are in the midst of a phased launch of our da Vinci 5 surgical system, which we expect to extend over several quarters, giving us time to mature our supply and manufacturing processes for the new system.

In September 2024, we obtained FDA clearance for our redesigned 8 mm SureForm 30 stapler and 8 mm SureForm 30 Curved-Tip stapler instruments and reloads for use with our da Vinci 5, da Vinci X, and da Vinci Xi surgical systems in general, thoracic, gynecologic, urologic, and pediatric surgical procedures. In April 2024, we obtained European certification in accordance with the EU MDR for our redesigned 8 mm SureForm 30 stapler and 8 mm SureForm 30 Curved-Tip stapler instruments and reloads for use in general, thoracic, gynecologic, urologic, and pediatric surgical procedures.

In August 2024, we obtained regulatory clearance in Taiwan for our da Vinci SP surgical system for use in endoscopic abdominopelvic, thoracoscopic, transoral otolaryngology, transanal colorectal, transanal total mesorectal excision, and breast surgical procedures. In January 2024, we obtained European certification in accordance with the EU MDR for our da Vinci SP surgical system for use in endoscopic abdominopelvic, thoracoscopic, transoral otolaryngology, transanal colorectal, and breast surgical procedures. We are commercializing the da Vinci SP surgical system in select major European countries as part of a measured rollout. In September 2022, we obtained regulatory clearance for our da Vinci SP surgical system in Japan for use in general, thoracic (excluding cardiac procedures and intercostal approaches), urologic, gynecologic, and transoral head and neck surgical procedures.
