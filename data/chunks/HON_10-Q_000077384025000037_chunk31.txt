COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS
The Company is subject to various federal, state, local, and foreign government requirements relating to the protection of the environment. With respect to environmental matters involving site contamination, the Company continually conducts studies, individually or jointly with other potentially responsible parties, to determine the feasibility of various remedial techniques. It is the Company's policy to record liabilities for environmental matters when remedial efforts or damage claim payments are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. Such liabilities are based on the Company's best estimate of the undiscounted future costs required to complete the remedial work. The recorded liabilities are adjusted periodically as remediation efforts progress or as additional technical, regulatory, or legal information becomes available.
Honeywell's environmental matters are further described in Note 19 Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the Company's 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K.
The following table summarizes information concerning the Company's recorded liabilities for environmental costs:
