Derivatives and Hedging.
Our primary objective in executing and holding derivatives is to reduce the earnings and cash flow volatility
associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices over the terms of our customer contracts. These
hedge contracts reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the impact of foreign currency exchange rate and commodity price movements. The
Company does not enter into or hold derivative instruments for speculative trading purposes.
We use foreign currency contracts to reduce the volatility of cash flows related to forecasted revenues, expenses, assets, and liabilities.
These contracts are generally
one
to
12
months
in duration but with maximum remaining maturities of up to
15
years
as of
March 31, 2025
.

$
54
million
gain and a net
$
33
million
gain as of

$
26
million
gain and a net
$
22
million
gain, respectively, related to our
share of AOCI recognized at our non-consolidated joint ventures. We expect to reclassify
$
38
million
of pre-tax net losses associated with
designated cash flow hedges to earnings in the next 12 months, contemporaneously with the earnings effects of the related forecasted
transactions. The Company reclassified net gains (losses) from AOCI into earnings of

$(

for the
three months
ended
