Treasury (including the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and OFAC), Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, Federal Reserve, OCC, CFPB, Financial Stability Oversight Council, FDIC, Department of Labor, SEC and CFTC in the U.S., foreign regulators, other government authorities and self-regulatory organizations. Further, we expect to become subject to future LRRs, including beyond those currently proposed, adopted or contemplated in the U.S. or abroad, and evolving interpretations of existing and future LRRs, which may include policies and rulemaking related to FDIC assessments, loss allocations between financial institutions and clients regarding the use of our products and services, including electronic payments, emerging technologies, such as the development and use of AI (including machine learning and generative AI), cybersecurity and data, employment practices and further climate and environmental risk management and sustainability reporting and disclosure, including emissions.

Regulatory focus is not limited to LRRs applicable to the financial services industry, but includes other significant LRRs that apply across industries and jurisdictions, including those related to anti-money laundering, anti-bribery, anti-corruption know-your-customer requirements, embargo programs and economic sanctions.
We are also subject to LRRs in the U.S. and abroad, including the GDPR and CCPA, and a number of additional jurisdictions enacting or considering similar laws or amendments to existing laws, regarding privacy and the disclosure, collection, use, sharing and safeguarding of personally identifiable information, including our employees, clients, suppliers, counterparties and other third parties, the violation of which could result in litigation, regulatory fines,
enforcement actions and operational loss. Also, we are and will continue to be subject to new and evolving data privacy laws in the
