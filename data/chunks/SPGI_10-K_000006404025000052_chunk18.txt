human error, natural disasters, power loss, telecommunication failures, cyber attacks, data breaches, break-ins, sabotage, intentional acts of vandalism, acts of terrorism, political unrest, war or otherwise. Our efforts to secure and plan for potential disruptions of our major operating systems are not always successful, and future disruptions could have a material adverse effect on the Company.
•
We rely on our information technology environment and certain critical databases, systems, applications and services (e.g. Amazon Web Services (“AWS”)) to support key product and service offerings. We believe we have appropriate policies, processes and internal controls to ensure the stability of our information technology, provide security from unauthorized access to our systems and maintain business continuity, but our business could be subject to significant disruption and our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected by unanticipated system failures, data corruption or unauthorized access to our systems.
•
On May 30, 2024, we experienced an outage caused by an erroneous internal modification of code in an enterprise technology tool. The outage resulted in loss of access to a significant amount of our products and services for various periods of time, ranging from approximately 1 hour to approximately 52 hours. Although this outage did not have a material adverse effect on the Company, it called our attention to certain deficiencies in our controls and system architecture.  While we have taken steps to address these deficiencies, we may experience outages or other disruptions in the future, and such outages or disruptions may have a material adverse effect on the Company.
•
The physical or technological infrastructure used by us or our third-party service providers can become obsolete or restrictive, unavailable, incompatible with future versions of our products, fail to be comprehensive or accurate, or fail to operate effectively, and our business could be adversely affected if we are unable to timely or effectively replace it.
•
We also do not have fully redundant systems for most of our smaller office locations and low-risk systems, and our disaster recovery plan does not include restoration of non-essential services. If a disruption occurs in one of our locations or systems and our personnel in those locations or those who rely on such systems are unable to utilize other systems or communicate with or travel to other locations, such persons’ ability to service and interact with our clients and customers may suffer.
•
We cannot predict with certainty all of the adverse effects that could result from our failure, or the failure of a third party, to efficiently address and resolve these delays and interruptions. A disruption to our operations or infrastructure could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
