Business Acquisition
Acquisition of Ameritrade
The Company acquired TD Ameritrade Holding Corporation, now Ameritrade Holding LLC (Ameritrade Holding) and its consolidated subsidiaries (collectively referred to as Ameritrade), effective October 6, 2020. The Company’s integration of Ameritrade is now complete. Through the integration, the Company generally adopted Schwab platforms and systems, though we’ve leveraged certain material advantages in Ameritrade’s platforms, including our comprehensive integration of Ameritrade’s thinkorswim

trading platforms, education, and tools into our offerings for retail and RIA clients. In 2023, we launched Schwab Trading Powered by Ameritrade™, an enhanced trading experience made possible by the combination of the thinkorswim trading platform with Schwab’s trading capabilities on Schwab.com and Schwab Mobile. We have also incorporated Ameritrade Institutional’s customizable portfolio rebalancing solution, iRebal

, as part of our offering for independent advisor clients.
Over the course of five client transition groups in 2023 and 2024, we converted approximately $1.9 trillion in client assets across more than 17 million client accounts, including 7,000 RIAs, from Ameritrade to Schwab. In May 2024, the Company completed the conversion of the final Ameritrade client transition group to the Schwab platform. Following the completion of the final client account conversions to CS&Co, TD Ameritrade, Inc., and TDAC submitted Uniform Requests for Broker-Dealer Withdrawal (BDW) to terminate their registration as broker-dealers with the SEC, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (FINRA), and other applicable regulatory organizations, and as of December 31, 2024, TD Ameritrade, Inc. and TDAC are no longer registered as broker-dealers with the SEC and FINRA.
