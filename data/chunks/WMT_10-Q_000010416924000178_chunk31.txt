Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities
Net cash provided by operating activities was $22.9 billion as compared to $19.0 billion for the nine months ended October 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase was primarily due to an increase in cash provided by operating income and lapping the payment of accrued opioid legal charges in the prior year comparable period, partially offset by increased inventory purchases.
Cash Equivalents and Working Capital Deficit
Cash and cash equivalents were $10.0 billion and $12.2 billion at October 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our working capital deficit was $15.6 billion as of October 31, 2024, which was relatively consistent with our $15.8 billion working capital deficit as of October 31, 2023. We generally operate with a working capital deficit due to our efficient use of cash in funding operations, consistent access to the capital markets and returns provided to our shareholders in the form of payments of cash dividends and share repurchases.
As of October 31, 2024 and January 31, 2024, cash and cash equivalents of $3.6 billion and $3.5 billion, respectively, may not be freely transferable to the U.S. due to local laws or other restrictions or are subject to the approval of the noncontrolling interest shareholders.
Net Cash Used in Investing Activities
Net cash used in investing activities was $12.7 billion as compared to $15.4 billion for the nine months ended October 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease of $2.7 billion for the nine months ended October 31, 2024 is primarily due to net proceeds received from sales of certain strategic investments, including $3.6 billion related to the sale of our JD.com investment, partially offset by an increase in payments for property and equipment.
Business acquisition
In December 2024, the Company completed the acquisition of Vizio Holding Corp. for net cash consideration of approximately $2 billion, which will be classified as cash used in investing activities in our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the year ending January 31, 2025.
Net Cash Used in Financing Activities
Net cash from financing activities generally consists of debt transactions, dividends paid, repurchases of Company stock and transactions with noncontrolling interest shareholders. Net cash used in financing activities was $9.7 billion and $0.2 billion for the nine months ended October 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase of $9.5 billion for the nine months ended October 31, 2024 is primarily due to lower short-term borrowings in the current year, lapping debt issuances in the prior year comparable period, and increased share repurchases, partially offset by lapping the purchase of certain non-controlling interest in the prior year comparable period.
In April 2024, the Company renewed and extended its existing 364-day
