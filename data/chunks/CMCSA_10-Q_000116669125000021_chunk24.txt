expenditures decreased for the three months ended March 31, 2025 compared to the same period in 2024 primarily reflecting decreased spending by the Connectivity & Platforms businesses on customer premise equipment and scalable infrastructure, as well as decreased spending on theme park attractions.

In the fourth quarter of 2023, we exercised our put right requiring Disney to purchase our interest in Hulu and received $8.6 billion, representing $9.2 billion for our share of Hulu’s minimum equity value presented as an advance on the sale of our investment in our condensed consolidated balance sheet, less $557 million for our share of prior capital calls. We expect to receive additional proceeds for the sale of our interest in Hulu following the final determination of Hulu’s fair value pursuant to a third-party appraisal process, at which time we will recognize the sale of our interest.
Financing Activities
Net cash used in financing activities increased for the three months ended March 31, 2025 compared to the same period in
2024
primarily due to higher repurchases and repayments of debt and higher dividends paid in the current year period. This increase was partially offset by a de
crease in repurchases of common stock in the current year period.
For the three months ended March 31, 2025, we made debt repayments of $604 million, including $419 million principal amount of notes due at maturity, $129 million of 3.950% Notes due 2025 and $56 million of 3.375% Notes due 2025.
We have made, and may from time to time in the future make, optional repayments on our debt obligations, which may include repurchases or exchanges of our outst
an
ding public notes and debentures, depending on various factors, such as market conditions. Any such repurchases may be effected through privately negotiated transactions, market transactions, tender offers, redemptions or otherwise. In particular, we may repurchase varying amounts of our outstanding public notes and debentures with short to medium term maturities through privately negotiated or market transactions. See Notes
5 and 7 for additional information on our financing activities.
Share Repurchases and Dividends
During the three months ended March 31, 2025, we repurchased a total of 56 million shares of our Class A common stock for $2.0 billion. In January 2025, our Board of Directors terminated the existing share repurchase program authorization and approved a new share repurchase program authorization of $15.0 billion, which has no expiration date. As of March 31, 2025, we had $13.7 billion re
maining under the authorization. We did not purchase any shares outside of this program. W
e expect to repurchase additional shares of our Class A common stock under this new authorization in the open market or in private transactions, subject to market and other conditions.
In addition, we paid $219 million and $256 million for the three months ended
March 31, 2025
and 2024, respectively, related to
