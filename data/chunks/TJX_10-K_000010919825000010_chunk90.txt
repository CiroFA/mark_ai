of February 1, 2025 and $
439
million as of February 3, 2024. The full amount of the loss carryforwards does not expire. For the deferred tax assets associated with the net operating loss carryforwards for which management has determined it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized, TJX had valuation allowances recorded of approximately $
50
million as of February 1, 2025 and $
62
million as of February 3, 2024.
The difference between the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate and TJX’s worldwide effective income tax rate is reconciled below:
There were no significant changes to TJX’s effective income tax rate for fiscal 2025, compared to fiscal 2024.
TJX had net unrecognized tax benefits of $
217
million as of February 1, 2025, $
228
million as of February 3, 2024 and $
265
million as of January 28, 2023.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:
Included in the gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits are items that will impact future effective tax rates upon recognition. These items amounted to $
212
million as of February 1, 2025, $
221
million as of February 3, 2024 and $
251
million as of January 28, 2023.
TJX is subject to U.S. federal income tax as well as income tax in multiple state, local and foreign jurisdictions. In the U.S. and India, fiscal years through 2010 are no longer subject to examination. In all other jurisdictions, fiscal years through 2011 are no longer subject to examination.

TJX’s accounting policy is to classify interest and penalties related to income tax matters as part of income tax expense. The amount of interest and penalties expensed was $
7
million for the fiscal years ended February 1, 2025, $
10
million for the fiscal years ended February 3, 2024 and $
7
million for the fiscal years ended January 28, 2023. The accrued amounts for interest and penalties are $
28
million as of February 1, 2025, $
32
million as of February 3, 2024 and $
37
million as of January 28, 2023.
Based on the final resolution of tax examinations, judicial or administrative proceedings, changes in facts or law, expirations of statutes of limitations in specific jurisdictions or other resolutions of, or changes in, tax positions, it is reasonably possible that unrecognized tax benefits for certain tax positions taken on previously filed tax returns may change materially from those represented on the Consolidated Financial Statements as of February 1, 2025. During the next twelve months, it is reasonably possible that tax audit resolutions may reduce unrecognized tax benefits by up to $
29
million, which would reduce the provision for taxes on earnings.
