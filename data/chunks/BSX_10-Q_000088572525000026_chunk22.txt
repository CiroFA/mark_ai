Senior Notes
We had senior notes outstanding of
$
11.243
billion
as of March 31, 2025 and $
10.451
billion as of December 31, 2024. Our senior notes were issued in public offerings, are redeemable prior to maturity and are not subject to sinking fund requirements. Our senior notes are unsecured, unsubordinated obligations and rank on parity with each other. These notes are effectively junior to liabilities of our subsidiaries (refer to
Other Arrangements
below).
In February 2025, American Medical Systems Europe B.V. (AMS Europe), an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of Boston Scientific, completed a registered public offering of €
1.500
billion in aggregate principal amount of euro-denominated senior notes comprised of €
850
million of
3.000
% Senior Notes due 2031 and €
650
million of
3.250
% Senior Notes due 2034 (collectively, the 2025 Eurobonds). Boston Scientific has fully and unconditionally guaranteed all of AMS Europe's obligations under the 2025 Eurobonds, and no other subsidiary of Boston Scientific will guarantee these obligations. AMS Europe is a “finance subsidiary” as defined in Rule 13-01(a)(4)(vi) of Regulation S-X. The financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of AMS Europe are consolidated in the financial statements of Boston Scientific. The 2025 Eurobonds offering resulted in cash proceeds of $
1.558
billion, net of investor discounts and issuance costs.
We used the net proceeds from the 2025 Eurobonds offering to fund the repayment at maturity of AMS Europe’s
0.750
% Senior Notes due March 8, 2025 and to pay accrued and unpaid interest with respect to such notes.
Additionally, we plan to use the remaining net proceeds for general corporate purposes, which may include, among other things, short term investments, reduction of short term debt, funding of working capital and potential future acquisitions.
In February 2024, AMS Europe completed a registered public offering of €

billion in aggregate principal amount of euro-denominated senior notes comprised of €

3.375
% Senior Notes due 2029 and €
1.250
billion of
3.500
% Senior Notes due 2032 (collectively, the 2024 Eurobonds). Boston Scientific has fully and unconditionally guaranteed all of AMS Europe's obligations under the 2024 Eurobonds, in addition to all of AMS Europe's obligations under the euro-denominated senior notes that were previously issued by AMS Europe in 2022, and no other subsidiary of Boston Scientific will guarantee these obligations. The 2024 Eurobonds offering resulted in cash proceeds of $
2.145
billion, net of investor discounts and issuance costs.
We primarily used the net proceeds from the 2024 Eurobonds offering to fund a
