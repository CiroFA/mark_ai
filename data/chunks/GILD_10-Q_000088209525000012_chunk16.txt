Level 2 Inputs
Foreign Currency Derivative Contracts
Our foreign currency derivative contracts have maturities of
18
months or less and all are with counterparties that have a minimum credit rating of A- or equivalent by S&P Global Ratings, Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. or Fitch Ratings, Inc. We estimate the fair values of these contracts by utilizing an income-based industry standard valuation model for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly. These inputs include foreign currency exchange rates, Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) and swap rates. These inputs, where applicable, are observable at commonly quoted intervals.
Level 3 Inputs

In connection with our first quarter 2021 acquisition of MYR GmbH, we are subject to a potential contingent consideration payment of up to €
300
million, subject to customary adjustments, which is revalued each reporting period using probability-weighted scenarios for U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) approval of Hepcludex until the related contingency is resolved.
