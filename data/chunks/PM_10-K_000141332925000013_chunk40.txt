activities for these products are designed for, and directed toward, current adult smokers and adult users of nicotine-containing products. We put significant effort to restrict access of our products from non-smokers and youth. Despite our efforts, technological, operational, regulatory and/or commercial developments might impact the implementation or effectiveness of youth access prevention mechanisms and surrounding infrastructure. If there is significant usage, whether actual or perceived, of our

products or competitive products among youth or non-smokers, even in situations over which we have no control, our reputation and credibility may suffer, the regulatory approach to our products may become more restrictive, and our efforts to advocate for the development of science-based regulatory frameworks for the development and commercialization of SFPs may be significantly impacted.
The FDAâ€™s premarket tobacco product and modified risk tobacco product authorizations of two versions of our
IQOS
product as well as the premarket tobacco authorizations of 20 varieties of
ZYN
pouches are subject to strict marketing, reporting and other requirements. Although we have received these authorizations from the FDA, there is no guarantee that the products will remain authorized for sale in the U.S., or that new versions of
IQOS
or other
ZYN
products will receive necessary authorizations, particularly if there is a significant uptake in youth or non-smoker initiation.
Moreover, we also submitted additional premarket tobacco applications for other
ZYN
products after the September 9, 2020 deadline, and we are unable to market these products until the FDA authorizes such applications. In April 2024, we also submitted MRTPAs for
ZYN
products currently marketed in the U.S. and requested authorization of the modified risk claim. There is no guarantee that the
ZYN
products will receive the necessary authorizations from the FDA.
The commercialization of our products in the United States is dependent on successfully managing compliance with federal, state, and local laws, regulations, legal agreements, and related interpretations. Failure to successfully manage compliance and to resolve any disputes that may arise regarding the application of legal and administrative requirements to our products could negatively impact the timing, manner, or success of our SFP commercialization in the United States, which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, revenues, cash flows, or profitability.
The financial and business performance of our smoke-free products is less predictable than our cigarette business.
Our SFPs are novel products in a relatively new category, and the pace at which adult smokers adopt them may vary, depending on the competitive, regulatory, fiscal and cultural environment, and other factors in a specific market. There may be periods of accelerated growth and periods of slower growth for these products, the timing and
