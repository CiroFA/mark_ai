Product Gross Margin
The following table summarizes the key factors that contributed to the change in product gross margin percentage from fiscal 2023 to fiscal 2024:
(1)
Productivity includes overall manufacturing-related costs, such as component costs, warranty expense, provision for inventory, freight, logistics, shipment volume, and other items not categorized elsewhere.
Product gross margin increased by 2.0 percentage points primarily driven by favorable product mix, productivity benefits, largely driven by lower freight and other costs, and benefits from Splunk. This was partially offset by the amortization of purchased intangible assets primarily related to Splunk, and negative impacts from pricing.
Supply Chain Impacts and Risks
In past periods, we took multiple actions in order to mitigate component shortages and address significant supply constraints. These supply constraints resulted in the need to secure long-term supply and increased inventory supply chain balances compared to historical levels. This in turn has significantly increased our supply chain exposure, which has resulted in negative impacts to our product gross margin in recent periods and may result in further negative impacts in future periods. This exposure includes potential material excess and obsolete or other charges if product demand significantly decreases for a sustained duration, we are unable to generate demand for certain products planned for development, or we are unable to mitigate the remaining supply chain exposures.
