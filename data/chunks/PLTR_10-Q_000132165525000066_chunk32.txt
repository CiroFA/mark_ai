Stock-Based Compensation
Stock-based compensation expenses increased by $29.7 million, or 24%, for the three months ended March 31, 2025 compared to the same period in 2024. The increase was driven by expense from new grants awarded since March 31, 2024, including restricted stock units (“RSUs”), performance-based RSUs (“P-RSUs”), and stock appreciation rights (“SARs’), partially offset by reductions in expense from equity awards that became fully vested and forfeitures.
Interest Income
Interest income increased by $7.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2025 compared to the same period in 2024 primarily due to an increase in our interest-bearing cash, cash equivalents, and investments in short-term U.S. Treasury securities.
