export restrictions, which could impact our business opportunities and operations. Any violation of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, the UK Bribery Act, other applicable anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws, or applicable export control or economic and trade sanctions laws by our employees or third-party intermediaries could subject us to significant risks such as adverse media coverage and/or severe criminal or civil sanctions, which could materially adversely affect our reputation and business.
Our customer deals are becoming more complex, which tend to involve longer and more expensive sales cycles, increased pricing pressure and implementation and configuration challenges.
The customer deals we pursue are becoming more complex as we engage with increasingly larger enterprise customers with multiple workflow products that span the enterprise. These deals can lead to increased costs, longer sales cycles, greater competition and less predictability in our ability to close sales. These customers tend to require considerable time evaluating our portfolio of products and testing our platform prior to making a purchasing decision, require multiple levels of review and approval from a broader set of buyers and stakeholders, and demand more configuration, integration services and features, particularly when switching from legacy on-premises solutions. As a result, these sales opportunities may require us to devote significant sales support and professional services to a smaller number of transactions, diverting those resources from other sales opportunities. If we fail to effectively manage these risks, our business may be negatively affected.
As we acquire or invest in companies and technologies, we may not realize the expected business or financial benefits and the acquisitions and investments may divert our management’s attention and result in additional shareholder dilution or costs.
We have acquired and invested in companies and technologies as part of our business strategy and will continue to evaluate and enter into potential strategic transactions, including, among other things, acquisitions of or investments in businesses, technologies, services, products and other assets. These transactions are intended to, among other things, expand or improve our service offerings and functionality, go-to-market and sales efforts, our operations or our ability to source necessary expertise and provide services in international locations. Although we conduct due diligence regarding these businesses and assets, our efforts may not reveal every material issue. Strategic transactions involve numerous risks, including:
•
difficulties assimilating or integrating the businesses, technologies, products, personnel or operations of the acquired companies;
•
failing to achieve the expected benefits of the acquisition or investment;
•
potential loss of employees of the acquired company;
•
inability to maintain relationships with customers,
