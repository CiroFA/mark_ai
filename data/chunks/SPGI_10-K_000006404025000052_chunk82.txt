attributable to proceeds received from the $750 million issuance of senior note in 2023.
Cash used for financing activities decreased to $4.3 billion in 2023 from $11.3 billion in 2022. The decrease is primarily attributable to a decrease in cash used for share repurchases in 2023.
During the year ended December 31, 2024, we received a total of 6.7 million shares, including 0.2 million shares received in February of 2024 related to our November 13, 2023 accelerated share repurchase (“ASR”) agreement, resulting in $3.3 billion of cash used to purchase shares. During the year ended December 31, 2023, we received a total of 8.6 million shares, including 0.4 million shares received in February of 2023 related to our December 2, 2022 ASR agreement, resulting in $3.3 billion of cash used to purchase shares. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we purchased 33.5 million shares for $12.0 billion of cash. See Note 9

On June 22, 2022, the Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing the purchase of 30 million shares (the “2022 Repurchase Program”), which was approximately 9% of the total shares of our outstanding common stock at that time. On January 29, 2020, the Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing the purchase of 30 million shares (the “2020 Repurchase Program”), which was approximately 12% of the total shares of our outstanding common stock at that time.

Additional Financing
On December 17, 2024, we entered into a revolving $2.0 billion
five-year
credit agreement that will terminate on December 17, 2029 (our “credit facility”). This credit facility replaced our revolving $2.0 billion five-year credit facility that was scheduled to terminate on April 26, 2026 (our “previous credit facility”). The previous credit facility was canceled immediately after the new credit facility became effective. There were no outstanding borrowings under the previous credit facility when it was replaced.
We have the ability to borrow a total of $2.0 billion through our commercial paper program, which is supported by our credit facility. As of December 31, 2024  and 2023, we had no outstanding commercial paper.
Commitment fees for the unutilized commitments under the credit facility and applicable margins for borrowings thereunder are linked to the Company achieving three environmental sustainability performance indicators related to emissions, tested annually. We currently pay a commitment fee of 7 basis points. The credit facility contains customary affirmative and negative covenants and customary events of default. The occurrence of an event of default could result in an acceleration of the obligations under the credit
