Equity Incentive Plans
Our 2021 Equity Incentive Plan (our “2021 Plan”) became effective in December 2021 and replaced our 2012 Equity Incentive Plan (our “2012 Plan”). Our 2021 Plan provides for the granting of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock awards (“RSAs”), restricted stock units (“RSUs”), performance shares (“PSAs”), performance-based stock units (“PSUs”) and performance stock options (“PSOs”) to our employees, directors, and consultants. Upon effectiveness of the 2021 Plan, the 2012 Plan was terminated and no further awards will be granted under the 2012 Plan. Awards that were outstanding upon such termination remained outstanding pursuant to their original terms, and any subsequent expiration, cancellation or forfeiture of awards under our 2012 Plan are returned to our 2021 Plan.
The majority of our equity awards are RSUs, which generally vest over a period of
three
to
four years
from the date of grant. Until vested, RSUs do not have the voting and dividend participation rights of common stock and the shares underlying the awards are not considered issued and outstanding.
Our PSUs generally vest over a period of
one
to
four years
from the date of grant. The number of PSUs eligible to vest is determined based on the level of achievement against certain performance conditions, market conditions, and a combination thereof.
During the year ended July 31, 2023, we granted
0.9
million shares of PSUs with both service and market conditions. The market conditions are satisfied when the price of our common stock is equal to or exceeds stock price targets of $
233.33
, $
266.67
, $
300.00
, and $
333.33
based on the average closing price for
30
consecutive trading days during the
three
- or
four
-year period following the date of grant. Once a market condition is met, its corresponding one-fourth of the awards vest on each anniversary date of the grant date, subject to continued service. As of July 31, 2024, all stock price targets for these PSU awards have been met, and the related shares will vest when the underlying service conditions are satisfied.
During the year ended July 31, 2023, we granted
0.8
million shares of PSUs, which contain service and market conditions. The service conditions are satisfied after a period of
five years
. The market condition is measured based
