program to issue unsecured commercial paper notes up to a maximum principal amount outstanding, at any time, of $3.0 billion, with a maturity of up to 397 days from the date of issue. We did not issue any commercial paper during the year ended December 28, 2024.
Our aggregate principal debt obligations were $1.8 billion as of December 28, 2024. Our 2.95% Notes with a principal amount of $750 million were repaid in June 2024 and our remaining debt will mature starting in 2030.
As of December 28, 2024, we had unconditional purchase commitments of approximately $5.0 billion, of which $4.5 billion are in fiscal year 2025. Our contractual obligations and purchase commitments relate primarily to our obligations to purchase wafers and substrates from third parties and future payments related to certain software and technology licenses and IP licenses. On an ongoing basis, we work with our suppliers on the timing of payments and deliveries of purchase commitments, taking into account business conditions. See Note 17 – Commitments and Guarantees.
On August 17, 2024, we agreed to acquire ZT Systems. Upon closing of the acquisition, we will pay approximately $3.4 billion in cash and 8,335,852 shares of AMD common stock and to the extent certain conditions are met, we will pay an additional $300 million of cash and up to 740,964 shares of AMD common stock. The acquisition is expected to close in the first half of fiscal year 2025, subject to certain regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. We intend to seek a strategic partner to acquire ZT Systems' manufacturing business.
We believe our cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and cash flows from operations along with our revolving credit facility and commercial paper program will be sufficient to fund operations, including capital expenditures, purchase commitments, and acquisitions over the next 12 months and beyond. We believe we will be able to access the capital markets should we require additional funds. However, we cannot assure that such funds will be available on favorable terms, or at all.
Operating Activities
Our working capital cash inflows and outflows from operations consist primarily of cash collections from our customers, payments for inventory purchases and payments for employee-related expenditures.
Net cash provided by operating activities was $3 billion in 2024, primarily due to our net income of $1.6 billion in 2024, adjusted for non-cash adjustments of $3.5 billion and net cash outflows of $2.1 billion from changes in our operating assets and liabilities. The primary drivers of the changes in operating assets and liabilities included a $1.9 billion increase in accounts receivable driven primarily by higher revenue in the last month of 2024 compared to the last month of 2023, and a $1.5 billion increase in inventories driven primarily by a build of inventory to support the ramp of new products in advanced process nodes.
