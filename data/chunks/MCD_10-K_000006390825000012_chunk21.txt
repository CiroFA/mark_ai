CASH FLOWS
The Company has a long history of generating significant cash from operations and has substantial credit capacity to fund operating and discretionary spending to invest in opportunities to grow the business, such as restaurant development, in addition to funding debt service payments, dividends and share repurchases.
Cash provided by operations totaled $9.4 billion in 2024, down slightly compared to 2023 in line with operating results. Free cash flow was $6.7 billion in 2024, a decrease of $580 million or 8%. The Company’s free cash flow conversion rate was 81% in 2024 and 86% in 2023.
Cash used for investing activities totaled $5.3 billion in 2024, an increase of $2.1 billion compared with 2023. The increase was primarily due to the Company's increased ownership stake in McDonald's China business, the acquisition of McDonald's business in Israel and higher
capital expenditures due to restaurant development initiatives.
Cash used for financing activities totaled $7.5 billion in 2024, an increase of $3.1 billion compared with 2023. The increase was primarily due to decreased bond issuances in the current year.
The Company’s cash and equivalents balance was $1.1 billion and $4.6 billion at year end 2024 and 2023, respectively. The higher cash balance in 2023 reflected the timing of certain debt issuances associated with the Company's required uses of cash in 2024. I
