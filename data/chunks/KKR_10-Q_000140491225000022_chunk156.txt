Net Policy Benefits and Claims
Net policy benefits and claims decreased for the three months ended March 31, 2025 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2024 primarily due to (i) lower initial reserves assumed related to new reinsurance transactions with life contingencies or morbidity risk in the three months ended March 31, 2025 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2024, and (ii) a decrease in the value of embedded derivatives in Global Atlantic's fixed indexed annuity products, as a result of new business inflows and equity market movements (as discussed above under "Condensed Consolidated Results of Operations (GAAP Basis - Unaudited)—Insurance—Revenues—Net investment-related gains (losses)," Global Atlantic purchases equity index options in order to hedge this risk, the fair value changes of which are accounted for in gains (losses) on derivative instruments, and generally offsetting the change in embedded derivative fair value reported in net policy benefits and claims).
These decreases were offset in part by (i) higher average funding costs due to higher crediting rates and the ordinary-course run-off of older business originated in a low interest rate environment, (ii) unfavorable impacts related to the assumption review described below, and (iii) an increase in market risk benefits losses due to a decrease in market interest rates for the three months ended March 31, 2025 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2024.
The assumptions on which reserves, deferred revenue and expenses are based are intended to represent an estimation of the benefits that are expected to be payable to, and fees or premiums that are expected to be collectible from, policyholders in future periods. Global Atlantic reviews the adequacy of its reserves, deferred revenue and expenses, and the assumptions underlying those items at least annually, usually in the third quarter, referred to as an "assumption review." As Global Atlantic analyzes its assumptions, to the extent Global Atlantic chooses to update one or more of those assumptions, there may be an “unlocking” impact. Generally, favorable unlocking means the change in assumptions required a reduction in reserves, or in deferred revenue liabilities, and unfavorable unlocking means the change in assumptions required an increase in reserves or in deferred revenue liabilities, or a reduction in deferred expenses.
For the three months ended March 31, 2025, there was a net unfavorable assumption review impact of $42.3 million on
