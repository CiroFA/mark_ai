from emerging technologies, such as AI (including machine learning and generative AI) and quantum computing, which may be used to enhance the tactics, techniques and procedures described above and facilitate new cyber threats. Despite substantial efforts to protect the integrity and resilience of our information systems and implement controls, processes, policies, employee training and other protective measures, we cannot anticipate and detect all cybersecurity threats and incidents and/or develop or implement effective preventive or defensive measures designed to prevent, respond to or mitigate all cybersecurity threats and incidents. Internal access management or other technology failures could impact the confidentiality, integrity or availability of data and information. Our vulnerability increases if employees fail to exercise sound judgment and vigilance when targeted with social engineering or other cyberattacks increases our vulnerability.
Our risk from and exposure to cybersecurity threats and incidents, information and security breaches and technology failures continues to increase due to the acceptance and use of digital banking and other digital products and services, including mobile banking products, and reliance on remote access tools and other technology, which have increased our reliance on virtual or digital interactions and a growing number of access points to our information systems that must be secured, and results in greater amounts of information being available for access. Greater demand on our information systems and security tools and processes will likely continue.
We also face significant third-party technology, cybersecurity and operational risks relating to the large number of clients and third parties with whom we do business, the financial services industry, upon whom we rely to facilitate or enable our business activities or upon whom our clients rely, including the secure collection, processing, maintenance, use, sharing, dissemination and disposition of client and other sensitive information, providers of products and services, financial counterparties, financial data aggregators, financial intermediaries, such as clearing agents, exchanges and clearing
houses, regulators, federal and state governments, providers of outsourced software, services and infrastructure, such as internet access, cloud service providers and electrical power, and retailers for whom we process transactions. Such third-party information systems extend beyond our security and control systems, and such third parties have varying levels of security and cybersecurity resources, expertise, safeguards, controls and capabilities. Threat actors may actively seek to exploit third-party security and cybersecurity weaknesses, and the relationships of our third parties with us may increase the risk that they are targeted by the same threats we face, and such third parties may be less prepared for such threats. Also, we are at risk from critical third-
