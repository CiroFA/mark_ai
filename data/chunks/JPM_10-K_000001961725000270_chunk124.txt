JPMorganChase relies on accurate, timely and complete data to effectively operate its systems and processes, including:
•
assessing risk exposures and limits
•
monitoring and detecting fraudulent transactions and cyber threats
•
developing or maintaining models and other analytical and judgment-based estimations, including those that use machine learning or artificial intelligence
•
implementing and maintaining compliance programs, and
•
preparing financial statements, disclosures and regulatory reports, as well as internal reporting
Any deficiencies in JPMorganChase’s data management processes, including with respect to the accuracy or completeness of data, the timeliness of data collection, the analysis or validation of data, or the safeguarding of data could undermine the reliability and effectiveness of its operations, including:

•
delivery of regulatory reporting or internal or external financial reporting
•
compliance practices, such as those relating to transaction monitoring, customer screening, blocking and rejecting transactions, recordkeeping or reporting
