profiles; and operating and development cost assumptions. Debt assumed in the acquisition was valued based on observable market prices. The fair values of accounts receivable, accounts payable, and most other current assets and current liabilities were determined to be equivalent to the carrying value due to their short-term nature. The acquisition, valued at $
16.5
billion, was allocated to the identifiable assets and liabilities based on their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date of November 22, 2024.
With the completion of the transaction, we acquired proved properties of approximately $
13.2
billion, with $
12.1
billion in Lower 48 and $
1.1
billion in Equatorial Guinea, and unproved properties of $
10.8
billion in Lower 48.
We recognized approximately $
545
million of transaction-related costs, the majority of which were expensed in the fourth quarter of 2024. These non-recurring costs related primarily to employee severance and related benefits, fees paid to advisors and the settlement of share-based awards for certain Marathon Oil employees based on the terms of the Merger Agreement. These transaction-related costs included $
328
million of employee severance expense.
