On November 9, 2021 the Company filed a writ of mandamus which claimed the exclusion of the amounts relating to the ICMS tax benefits granted by the State of Minas Gerais through the special regime from the tax base of the Corporate Income Tax (“IRPJ”) and of the Social Contribution on Net Profits (“CSLL”). On January 31, 2022, a decision was rendered granting the injunction requested in order to exclude the amounts of tax benefits granted by the State of Minas Gerais in the tax base of IRPJ and CSLL. On August 14, 2023, a judgment was handed down in favor of the Company and the Public Prosecutor's Office filed an appeal. On April 17, 2024, the Federal Regional Court ruled in favor of the Company.

For that reason, the Company has not recorded any expense or liability for the disputed amounts. The Company recorded a corresponding income tax benefit arising from the ICMS tax incentives for the period from September 2021 up to December 2023, which was $
33
million
as of
December 31, 2024.
In December 2023 Law 14,789 was enacted, with effect from January 2024, modifying the previous regulation so that the inclusion of the presumed tax credits in the calculation basis of IRPJ/CSLL would become mandatory. On October 18, 2024, the subsidiary eBazar.com.br Ltda. filed two new writs of mandamus, seeking the recognition of the right not to submit to the illegal and unconstitutional requirement of the IRPJ and the CSLL on the presumed tax credits from transactions related to the ICMS in the fiscal year of 2024 forward. Management’s opinion, based on the opinion of external legal counsel, is
