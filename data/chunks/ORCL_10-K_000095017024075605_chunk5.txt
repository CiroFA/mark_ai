and industry-specific products, among others. Customers generally opt to purchase hardware support contracts when they purchase Oracle hardware products.
Oracle also offers professional services to assist our customers and partners to maximize the performance of their investments in Oracle products and services.
Providing choice and flexibility to Oracle customers as to when and how they deploy Oracle applications and infrastructure technologies is an important element of our corporate strategy. We believe that offering customers broad, comprehensive, flexible and interoperable deployment models for Oracle applications and infrastructure technologies is important to our growth strategy and better addresses customer needs relative to our competitors, many of whom provide fewer offerings, more restrictive deployment models and less flexibility for a customerâ€™s transition to cloud-based IT environments.

Our selective and active acquisition program is another important element of our corporate strategy. We believe that our acquisitions enhance the products and services that we can offer to customers, expand our customer base, provide
