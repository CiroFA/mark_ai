generated from operations, cash, cash equivalents and investments will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs for at least the next 12 months. As we look beyond the next 12 months, we seek to continue to grow free cash flows necessary to fund our operations and grow our business. If we require additional capital resources, we may seek to finance our operations from the current funds available or additional equity or debt financing.
Operating Activities
Net cash provided by operating activities was $1,677 million for the three months ended March 31, 2025 compared to $1,341 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024. The net increase in operating cash flows was primarily due to higher collections driven by revenue growth.
Investing Activities
Net cash used in investing activities was $217 million for the three months ended March 31, 2025 compared to $734 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024. The net decrease in cash used in investing activities was primarily due to a $573 million decrease in net purchases of investments, a $38 million decrease in purchases of non-marketable investments, partially offset by a $70 million increase in purchases of property and equipment, a $13 million increase in purchases of other intangible assets, and an $8 million increase in business combinations.
Financing Activities
Net cash used in financing activities was $398 million for the three months ended March 31, 2025 compared to $443 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024. The net decrease in cash used in financing activities is primarily due to an  $184 million decrease in business combination related to the second installment payment in the acquisition of G2K Group GmbH made during the three months ended March 31, 2024 and a $22 million increase in proceeds from employee stock plans, partially offset by an increase in repurchases of common stock of $123 million and a $38 million increase in taxes paid related to net share settlement of equity awards.
