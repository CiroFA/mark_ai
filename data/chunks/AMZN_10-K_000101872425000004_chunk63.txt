Interest on the Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears. We may redeem the Notes at any time in whole, or from time to time, in part at specified redemption prices. We are not subject to any financial covenants under the Notes. The estimated fair value of the Notes was approximately $

As of September 30, 2024, we had repaid outstanding borrowings and terminated the secured revolving credit facility with a lender that was secured by certain seller receivables (the “Credit Facility”). The Credit Facility bore interest based on the daily Secured Overnight Financing Rate plus
1.25
%, and had a commitment fee of up to
0.45
% on the undrawn portion. There were $
682
million of borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facility as of December 31, 2023, which had an interest rate of
6.6
%. As of December 31, 2023, we had pledged $

0.75
