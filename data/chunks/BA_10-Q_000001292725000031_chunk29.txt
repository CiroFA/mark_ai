Revenues
BDS revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2025, decreased by $652 million compared with the same period in 2024. The decrease is primarily due to lower volume on P-8, KC-46 Tanker, ground-based missile defense, proprietary, and E-7 programs, as well as the absence of a favorable MQ-25 contract modification that was awarded during the first quarter of 2024. The decrease in revenue was partially offset by $70 million lower net unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments compared to the prior year comparable period.
Earnings From Operations
BDS earnings from operations for the three months ended March 31, 2025, was $155 million, compared with $151 million in the same period in 2024. The increase in earnings is primarily due to lower net unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments of $213 million compared to the comparable period in the prior year. The lower net unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments were largely offset by lower earnings from equity method investments and lower volume and mix on P-8, F-15, E-7, and ground-based missile defense programs. During the three months ended March 31, 2025, losses incurred on the five major fixed-price development programs totaled $0 million compared to $222 million in the same period in 2024.

BDS earnings from operations includes our share of earnings from equity method investments of $6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2025, compared with $75 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024.
Backlog
BDS backlog of $61,567 million at March 31, 2025 compared with $64,023 million as of December 31, 2024, reflects revenue recognized on contracts awarded in prior periods and the timing of awards. In March 2025, the U.S. Air Force announced that Boeing has been awarded a contract to design, build and deliver the F-47, its next-generation fighter aircraft. This order is not included in backlog at March 31, 2025, pending completion of the source selection and evaluation review process.
Additional Considerations
Our BDS business includes a variety of development programs which have complex design and technical challenges. Some of these programs have cost-type contracting arrangements. In these cases, the associated financial risks are primarily reduced award or incentive fees, lower profit rates or program cancellation if cost, schedule or technical performance issues arise. Examples of these programs include Ground-based Midcourse Defense, Proprietary and Space Launch System programs.
Some of our development programs are contracted on a fixed-price basis. Examples of significant fixed-price development programs include Commercial Crew, KC-46A Tanker, MQ-25, T-7A Red Hawk, VC-25B, and commercial and military satellites. A number of our ongoing fixed-price development programs have reach-forward losses. New programs could also have risk for reach-forward loss upon
