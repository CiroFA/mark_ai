shareholder, is entitled to vote his or her shares in his or her own interests, which may not always be in the interests of our shareholders generally, and the separation between voting power and economic interests caused by the Founder Share could cause conflicts of interest between Tobias LÃ¼tke and our other shareholders.
Our share capital structure has the effect of limiting the influence of holders of Class A subordinate voting shares over most corporate matters.
Because the Class B restricted voting shares carry a greater number of votes per share relative to the Class A subordinate voting shares, and the Founder Share has a variable number of votes, the holders of our Class B restricted voting shares and the Founder Share collectively control a substantial percentage of the combined voting power of our voting shares even though the Class B restricted voting shares and the Founder Share each represent a substantially reduced percentage of our total outstanding shares. The concentrated Voting Control of holders of our Class B restricted voting shares and the Founder Share limits the ability of our Class A subordinate voting shareholders to influence corporate matters for the foreseeable future, including the election of directors as well as with respect to decisions regarding amendment of our share capital, creating and issuing additional classes of shares, making significant acquisitions, selling significant assets or parts of our business, merging with other companies and undertaking other significant transactions. As a result, holders of Class B restricted voting shares and the Founder Share have the ability to influence many matters affecting us and actions may be taken that our Class A subordinate voting shareholders may not view as beneficial. Given the terms of the Founder Share, this will continue to be the case even following the conversion of all Class B restricted voting shares in accordance with their terms, as the conversion will increase the voting power of the Founder Share. The market price of our Class A subordinate voting shares could be adversely affected due to the significant influence and voting power of the holders of Class B restricted voting shares and the Founder Share. Additionally, the significant voting interest of holders of Class B restricted voting shares and Founder Share may discourage transactions involving a change of control, including transactions in which an investor, as a holder of the Class A subordinate voting shares, might otherwise receive a premium for the Class A subordinate voting shares over the then-current market price, or discourage competing proposals if a going private transaction is proposed by our significant shareholder.
Our restated articles of incorporation amend certain default rights provided for under the
Canada Business Corporations Act
(the "CBCA") for holders of Class B restricted voting shares, Founder Share and Class A subordinate voting shares to vote separately as a class for
