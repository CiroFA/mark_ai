Earnings Per Share
Basic earnings per share is computed based on the weighted-average number of shares outstanding.
Diluted earnings per share is computed based on the weighted-average number of shares outstanding plus potentially dilutive shares outstanding during the period. Potentially dilutive shares are determined by applying the treasury stock method to the Company’s stock options, RSUs (including PRSUs), common stock to be issued under the ESPP and warrants.
The following table sets forth the components of basic and diluted earnings per share:
Potential shares from employee equity plans totaling
1

6
million and
16
million weighted-average shares for 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, were not included in the earnings per share calculation because their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive.
