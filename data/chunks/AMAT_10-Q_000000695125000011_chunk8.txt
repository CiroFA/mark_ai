Borrowing Facilities and Debt
Revolving Credit Facilities
In February 2020, we entered into a
five-year
$
1.5
billion committed unsecured revolving credit agreement (Revolving Credit Agreement) with a group of banks. The Revolving Credit Agreement includes a provision under which we may request an increase in the amount of the facility of up to $
500
million for a total commitment of no more than $
2.0
billion, subject to the receipt of commitments from one or more lenders for any such increase and other customary conditions. The Revolving Credit Agreement is scheduled to expire in February 2026, unless extended as permitted under the Revolving Credit Agreement. The Revolving Credit Agreement provides for borrowings that bear interest for each advance at one of two rates selected by us, plus an applicable margin, which varies according to our public debt credit ratings.
No
amounts were outstanding under the Revolving Credit Agreement as of January 26, 2025 and October 27, 2024.
