approach that discounts expected future cash flows to the present value, which requires the use of Level 3 fair value measurements and inputs, including estimated revenues, costs, and probability of technical and regulatory success. The expected cash flows included cash flows from HR+/HER2- metastatic breast cancer for third-line plus patients and patients in earlier lines of therapy which are the subject of separate clinical studies. Our revised discounted cash flows were lower primarily due to a delay in launch timing for third-line plus patients which caused a decrease in our market share assumptions based on the expected competitive environment. As of March 2022, there were no changes in our plans or assumptions related to our estimated cash flows for patients in the earlier lines of therapy. We used a discount rate of
6.75
% which is based on the estimated weighted-average cost of capital for companies with profiles similar to ours and represents the rate that market participants would use to value the intangible assets. We determined the revised estimated fair value was below the carrying value of the asset and, as a result, we recognized a partial impairment charge of $
2.7
billion in In-process research and development impairments on our Consolidated Statements of Operations during the first quarter of 2022.
