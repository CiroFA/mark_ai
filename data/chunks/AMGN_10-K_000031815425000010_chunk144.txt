including upon the exercise of options, upon the vesting of awards of RSUs or when performance units are earned and related dividend equivalents have been granted.

The Amended 2009 Plan employs a fungible share-counting formula for determining the number of shares available for issuance under the plan. In accordance with this formula, each option or stock appreciation right counts as one share, while each RSU, performance unit or dividend equivalent counts as 1.9 shares. The number under column (a) represents the actual number of shares issuable under our outstanding awards without giving effect to the fungible share-counting formula. The number under column (c) represents the number of shares available for issuance under this plan based on each such available share counting as one share. Commencing with the grants made in April 2012, RSUs and performance units accrue dividend equivalents that are payable in shares only to the extent and when the underlying RSUs vest or underlying performance units have been earned and the related shares are issued to the grantee. The performance units granted under this plan are earned based on the accomplishment of specified performance goals at the end of their respective three-year performance periods; the number of performance units granted represent target performance, and the maximum number of units that could be earned based on our performance is 200% of the performance units granted in 2022, 2023 and 2024.
As of December 31, 2024, the number of outstanding awards under column (a) includes (i) 5,909,018 shares issuable upon the exercise of outstanding options with a weighted-average exercise price of $225.84; (ii) 3,289,089 shares issuable upon the vesting of outstanding RSUs, including 198,925 related dividend equivalents; and (iii) 1,516,669 shares subject to outstanding 2022, 2023 and 2024 performance units, including 91,901 related dividend equivalents. The weighted-average exercise price shown in column (b) is for the outstanding options only. The number of available shares under column (c) represents the number of shares that remain available for future issuance under this plan as of December 31, 2024, employing the fungible share formula and presumes the issuance of target shares under the performance units granted in 2022, 2023 and 2024 and related dividend equivalents. The numbers under columns (a) and (c) do not give effect to the additional shares that could be issuable in the event that above target performance on the performance goals under these outstanding performance units is achieved. Maximum performance under these goals could result in 200% of target shares being awarded for performance units granted in 2022, 2023 and 2024.
