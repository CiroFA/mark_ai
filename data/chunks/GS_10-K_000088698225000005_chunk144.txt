Regulatory and Other Matters
Regulatory Matters
Our businesses are subject to extensive regulation and supervision worldwide. Regulations have been adopted or are being considered by regulators and policy makers worldwide. Given that many of the new and proposed rules are highly complex, the full impact of regulatory reform will not be known until the rules are implemented and market practices develop under the final regulations.
See “Business — Regulation” in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-K for further information about the laws, rules and regulations and proposed laws, rules and regulations that apply to us and our operations.
Other Matters
Narrowing our Focus on Consumer-Related Activities.
During 2023 and 2024, we narrowed our focus with respect to consumer-related activities by taking the following actions:
•
We completed the sale of substantially all of the Marcus loan portfolio in 2023 (included within Asset & Wealth Management).
•
We sold our PFM business in 2023 (included within Asset & Wealth Management).
•
We sold the majority of the GreenSky loan portfolio in 2023 and, during 2024, completed the sale of GreenSky (included within Platform Solutions).
•
During 2024, we entered into an agreement to transition the GM credit card program (included within Platform Solutions) to another issuer. The transition is expected to be completed in the third quarter of 2025.
•
During 2024, we sold our seller financing loan portfolio (included within Platform Solutions). This portfolio consisted of loans that were extended to small- and medium-sized retailers.
We remain committed to supporting the products and servicing customers through the various transition arrangements for our consumer-related activities.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis
The table below presents the impact to pre-tax earnings of the items that we sold or have announced the decision to sell (with respect to the narrowing of our focus on consumer-related activities).
In the table above, pre-tax earnings related to GreenSky, the GM credit card program and the seller financing loan portfolio were included within Platform Solutions and the pre-tax earnings related to the Marcus loan portfolio and PFM were included within Asset & Wealth Management.
We have the following remaining consumer-related activities within Platform Solutions:
•
We issue credit cards to and raise deposits from Apple Card customers.
•
We will continue to support existing GM customers and issue credit cards to new GM customers until the transition of the GM credit card program to another issuer is completed.
Future decisions we may make in connection with the narrowing of our focus on consumer-related activities could have a material impact on our results of operations in the period such
