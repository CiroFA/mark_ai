THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
Management’s Discussion and Analysis
We believe our credit ratings are primarily based on the credit rating agencies’ assessment of:
•
Our liquidity, market, credit and operational risk management practices;
•
Our level and variability of earnings;
•
Our capital base;
•
Our franchise, reputation and management;
•
Our corporate governance; and
•
The external operating and economic environment, including, in some cases, the assumed level of government support or other systemic considerations, such as potential resolution.
Certain of our derivatives have been transacted under bilateral agreements with counterparties who may require us to post collateral or terminate the transactions based on changes in our credit ratings. We manage our GCLA to ensure we would, among other potential requirements, be able to make the additional collateral or termination payments that may be required in the event of a two-notch reduction in our long-term credit ratings, as well as collateral that has not been called by counterparties, but is available to them. See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about derivatives with credit-related contingent features and the additional collateral or termination payments related to our net derivative liabilities under bilateral agreements that could have been called by counterparties in the event of a one- or two-notch downgrade in our credit ratings.

Cash flow analysis may, however, be helpful in highlighting certain macro trends and strategic initiatives in our businesses.

The net cash used for investing activities primarily reflected net purchases of U.S. government obligations accounted for as available-for-sale securities and an increase in net lending activities (reflecting increases in other collateralized loans). The net cash used for operating activities primarily reflected cash outflows from trading assets, partially offset by cash inflows from collateralized transactions (reflecting both an increase in collateralized financings and a decrease in collateralized agreements). The net cash provided by financing activities primarily reflected cash inflows from other secured financings and deposits (reflecting increases in consumer deposits, partially offset by
