in November 2023.
Revenue of Jardiance remained relatively flat in the U.S. as increased demand was offset by lower realized prices. Revenue outside the U.S. increased 52 percent, driven by increased volume and a one-time payment received of $300.0 million associated with an amendment to our collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim. Pursuant to the amendment, we and Boehringer Ingelheim adjusted commercialization responsibilities for Jardiance within certain smaller markets. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding our collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim involving Jardiance.
Revenue of Taltz increased 18 percent in the U.S., driven by higher realized prices due to changes in estimates for rebates and discounts, as well as increased demand. Revenue outside the U.S. increased 19 percent, primarily driven by increased demand.

Gross margin as a percent of revenue in 2024 increased 2.1 percentage points compared with 2023, primarily driven by favorable product mix and higher realized prices.
Research and development expenses increased 18 percent in 2024, primarily driven by continued investments in our early and late-stage portfolio.
Marketing, selling, and administrative expenses increased 16 percent in 2024, primarily driven by promotional efforts supporting ongoing and future launches.
Acquired in-process research and development (IPR&D) charges recognized in 2024 primarily related to the acquisition of Morphic.

Our effective tax rate was 16.5 percent in 2024, compared with an effective tax rate of 20.1 percent in 2023.
