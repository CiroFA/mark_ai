changes in the underlying rates and minimize the risk of changes in the fair value of our senior notes.
Fair Value Hedges.
We had outstanding interest rate swap agreements with combined notional amounts of $
5.4
billion at both February 2, 2025 and January 28, 2024. These agreements are accounted for as fair value hedges that swap fixed for variable rate interest to hedge changes in the fair values of certain senior notes. At February 2, 2025 and January 28, 2024, the fair values of these agreements totaled $
795
million and $
858
million, respectively, all of which are recognized in other long-term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets.
All of our interest rate swap agreements designated as fair value hedges meet the shortcut method requirements under GAAP. Accordingly, the changes in the fair values of these agreements offset the changes in the fair value of the hedged long-term debt.
Cash Flow Hedges.
At February 2, 2025 and January 28, 2024, we had outstanding foreign currency forward contracts accounted for as cash flow hedges, which hedge the variability of forecasted cash flows associated with certain payments made in our foreign operations. At February 2, 2025 and January 28, 2024, the notional amounts and the fair values of these contracts were not material. Additionally, the realized and unrealized gains and losses on these instruments were not material during fiscal 2024, fiscal 2023, and fiscal 2022.
From time to time, we also use treasury locks or forward-starting interest rate swap agreements to hedge the variability in future interest payments attributable to changing interest rates on forecasted debt issuances. There were no such instruments outstanding as of February 2, 2025 or January 28, 2024. All previously settled arrangements were designated as cash flow hedges and thus, the corresponding losses were initially recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss and are being amortized to interest expense over the life of the respective notes. Unamortized losses remaining in accumulated other comprehensive loss were immaterial as of February 2, 2025 and January 28, 2024, as were the losses recognized within interest expense for fiscal 2024, fiscal 2023, and fiscal 2022.
We expect an immaterial amount of losses related to cash flow hedges recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss as of February 2, 2025 to be reclassified into earnings within the next 12 months.
Collateral.
We generally enter into master netting arrangements, which are designed to reduce credit risk by permitting net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty. To further limit our credit risk, we enter into collateral security arrangements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair value of certain derivative instruments exceeds or falls below contractually established thresholds. The cash collateral posted by the Company related to derivative instruments under our collateral security arrangements was $
