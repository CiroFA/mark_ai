Residential Mortgage-Backed Securities
As of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, 15% and 13% of the AFS fixed maturity securities portfolio was invested in RMBS, respectively. RMBS are securities constructed from pools of residential mortgages and backed by payments from those pools. Excluding limitations on access to lending and other extraordinary economic conditions, Global Atlantic would expect prepayments of principal on the underlying loans to accelerate with decreases in market interest rates and diminish with increases in market interest rates.
The NAIC designations for RMBS, including prime, sub-prime, alt-A, and adjustable rate mortgages with variable payment options ("Option ARM"), are based upon a comparison of the bond’s amortized cost to the NAIC’s loss expectation for each security. Accordingly, an investment in the same security at a lower cost may result in a higher quality NAIC designation in recognition of the lower likelihood the investment would result in a realized loss. Prime residential mortgage lending includes loans to the most creditworthy borrowers with high quality credit profiles. Alt-A is a classification of mortgage loans where the risk profile of the borrower is between prime and sub-prime, which also includes certain non-qualified mortgages. Sub-prime mortgage lending is the business of originating residential mortgage loans to borrowers with weaker credit profiles.
As of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, 89% and 84% of RMBS securities that are below investment grade as rated by the NRSRO, carry an NAIC 1 ("highest quality") designation, respectively.
