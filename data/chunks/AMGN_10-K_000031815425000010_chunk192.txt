Amgen Inc. et al. v. Accord et al.
On November 13, 2024, Amgen Inc. and Amgen Manufacturing Limited LLC filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina (North Carolina District Court) against Accord Biopharma, Inc., Accord Healthcare, Inc. and Intas Pharmaceuticals, Ltd. (collectively Accord) based on the submission to the FDA of a BLA seeking approval to market and sell a biosimilar version of Amgen’s Prolia and XGEVA products. The complaint asserts infringement of the following
34
patents: U.S. Patent Nos. 7,364,736; 7,662,930; 7,888,101; 7,928,205; 8,053,236; 8,058,418; 8,460,896; 8,680,248; 9,012,178; 9,133,493; 9,228,168; 9,320,816; 9,328,134; 9,359,435; 9,388,447; 10,106,829; 10,167,492; 10,227,627; 10,513,723; 10,583,397; 10,655,156; 10,822,630; 10,894,972; 11,077,404; 11,098,079; 11,130,980; 11,254,963; 11,299,760; 11,319,568; 11,434,514; 11,459,595; 11,946,085; 11,952,605; and 12,084,686 (collectively, the Asserted Patents against Accord). Amgen seeks a judgment from the North Carolina District Court that Accord has infringed or will infringe one or more claims of each of the Asserted Patents against Accord and based on that judgment, a permanent injunction prohibiting the commercial manufacture, use, offer to sell, or sale within the United States or importation into the United States of Accord’s proposed denosumab biosimilar before expiration of each of the Asserted Patents against Accord found infringed. Amgen also seeks monetary remedies for any past acts of infringement. Accord responded to the complaint on January 10, 2025, denying infringement and asserting affirmative defenses including invalidity and non-infringement.
On February 6, 2025, the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation granted Amgen’s November 15, 2024 motion to transfer this case from the North Carolina District Court to the New Jersey District Court for coordinated and consolidated pretrial proceedings with the other cases involving Prolia/XGEVA biosimilars pending in the district.
On December 30, 2024, the parties jointly filed a stipulation agreeing to a consent injunction, which was subsequently entered by the North Carolina District Court, providing that that the Accord biosimilar products at issue will not be made, used, sold, offered for sale or imported into the United States before October 1, 2025, except as permitted by 35 U.S.C. § 271(e)(1).
