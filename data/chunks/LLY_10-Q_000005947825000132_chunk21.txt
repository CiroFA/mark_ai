Boehringer Ingelheim Collaboration
We and Boehringer Ingelheim have a global agreement to jointly develop and commercialize a portfolio of compounds. Boehringer Ingelheim's Jardiance product family, that includes Glyxambi, Synjardy, and Trijardy XR, is the significant product family included in the collaboration.
For the Jardiance product family, we and Boehringer Ingelheim generally share equally in certain significant ongoing development and commercialization costs, and we record our portion of the development and commercialization costs as research and development expense and marketing, selling, and administrative expense, respectively. We receive a royalty on net sales of the Jardiance product family in the most significant markets and recognize the royalty as collaboration and other revenue. Boehringer Ingelheim is entitled to potential performance payments depending on the net sales of the Jardiance product family; therefore, our reported revenue for Jardiance may be reduced by any potential performance payments we make related to this product family. The royalty received by us related to the Jardiance product family may also be increased or decreased depending on whether net sales for this product family exceed or fall below certain thresholds.
The following table summarizes our revenue recognized:
In the first quarter of 2025, we and Boehringer Ingelheim amended our collaboration to adjust commercialization responsibilities for the Jardiance product family in certain markets, resulting in our recognition of a one-time benefit of $
370.0
million as Jardiance revenue. Resulting from recent amendments, we have the right to receive up to $
610.0
million in potential sales-based milestones related to the Jardiance product family in certain markets through December 31, 2026. No such sales-based milestones were recognized as of March 31, 2025.
