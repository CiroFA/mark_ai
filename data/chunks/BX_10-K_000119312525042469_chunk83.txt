enforcement actions against several investment advisers relating to sustainability disclosures and policies and procedures failures. Any perception or accusation that we are overstating, or, conversely, understating our engagement in
sustainability-related
practices could damage our reputation, result in litigation or regulatory actions, and adversely impact our ability to raise capital and attract new investors. Outside of the United States, the European regulatory environment for alternative investment fund managers and financial services firms continues to evolve and increase in complexity, making compliance more costly and
time-consuming.
See “—Climate change, climate and
sustainability-related
regulation and sustainability concerns could adversely affect our business and the operations of our funds’ portfolio companies, and any actions we take or fail to take in response to such matters could damage our reputation.”
We may also communicate certain initiatives regarding environmental, human capital management, and other
sustainability-related
matters in our SEC filings or in other disclosures by us or our funds. These initiatives could be difficult and expensive to implement, the personnel, processes and technologies needed to implement them may not be cost effective and may not advance at a sufficient pace, and we may not be able to accomplish them within the timelines we announce or at all. We could, for example, determine that it is not feasible or practical to implement or complete certain of such initiatives based on cost, timing or other considerations.
Furthermore, we could be criticized for the accuracy, adequacy or completeness of the disclosure related to our or our funds’
sustainability-related
policies, practices and initiatives (and progress on those initiatives), which disclosure may be based on frameworks and standards for measuring progress that are still developing, internal controls and processes that continue to evolve, and assumptions that are subject to change in the future. In addition, we could be criticized for the scope or nature of such initiatives, or for any revisions to these initiatives. Further, as part of our sustainability practices, we rely from time to time on
third-party
data, services and methodologies and such services, data and methodologies could prove to be incomplete or inaccurate. If our or such third parties’
sustainability-related
data, processes or reporting are incomplete or inaccurate, or if we fail to achieve progress on a timely basis, or at all, we may be subject to enforcement action and our reputation could be adversely affected, particularly if in connection with such matters we were to be accused of greenwashing.
Climate change, climate and
sustainability-related
regulation and sustainability concerns could adversely affect our businesses and the operations of our funds’ portfolio companies, and any actions we take or fail to take in response to such matters could damage our reputation.
