as of November 29, 2024. Subsequent to November 29, 2024, the outstanding ASR was settled which resulted in total repurchases of
5.0
million shares at an average price of $
501.37
.
Prepayments for stock repurchases are classified as treasury stock, a component of stockholders’ equity on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, at the payment date, though only shares physically delivered to us by the end of the respective period are excluded from the computation of net income per share. As of November 29, 2024, a portion of the $
2.5
billion prepayment under the ASR entered into in September 2024 was evaluated as an unsettled forward contract indexed to our own stock, classified within stockholders’ equity.
Subsequent to November 29, 2024, as part of the March 2024 stock repurchase authority, we entered into stock repurchase arrangements with a large financial institution which totaled $
3.25
billion, including a $
2.75
billion ASR and a trading plan under which we may execute up to $
500
million in open market repurchases. Under the ASR, we received an initial delivery of
4.5
million shares, which represents approximately
75
% of our $
2.75
billion prepayment.

NET INCOME PER SHARE
Basic net income per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period, excluding unvested stock-based awards and purchase rights. Diluted net income per share is based upon the weighted average common shares outstanding for the period plus dilutive potential common shares, including unvested restricted stock units, stock purchase rights and performance share awards using the treasury stock method. Performance share awards are included based on the number of shares that would be issued as if the end of the reporting period was the end of the performance period and the result was dilutive.
The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted net income per share for fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022:
