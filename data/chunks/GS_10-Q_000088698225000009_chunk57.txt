financings that are accounted for at fair value.
Other secured financings that are not recorded at fair value are recorded based on the amount of cash received plus accrued interest, which generally approximates fair value. As these financings are not accounted for at fair value, they are not included in the firm’s fair value hierarchy in Notes 4 and 5. Had these financings been included in the firm’s fair value hierarchy, substantially all would have been classified in level 3 as of both March 2025 and December 2024.
