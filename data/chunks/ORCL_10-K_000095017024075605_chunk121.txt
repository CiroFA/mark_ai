its own stock at an inflated price. Plaintiff also claims that defendants violated their fiduciary duties of candor, good faith, loyalty, and due care by failing to prevent this alleged harm. Plaintiff also brings derivative claims for violations of federal securities laws. Plaintiff seeks a ruling that this case may proceed as a derivative action, a finding that defendants are liable for breaching their fiduciary duties, an award of damages to Oracle, an order directing defendants to enact corporate reforms, attorneys’ fees and costs, and unspecified relief. Beginning on June 14, 2021, the court “so ordered” several stipulations from the parties, staying this case. The parties have reached an agreement in principle to settle this case, under which Oracle will implement certain corporate governance measures, which shall remain in place for
five years
, and Oracle will pay plaintiffs’ attorneys’ fees and costs of no more than $
700,000
. On April 5, 2024, plaintiffs filed a motion for preliminary approval of the proposed settlement, and the court will hold a preliminary fairness hearing on the proposed settlement on August 8, 2024.
While Oracle continues to evaluate these claims, we do not believe these matters will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.
