Income Taxes
Deferred taxes are recognized for the future tax effects of temporary differences between financial and income tax reporting based on enacted tax laws and rates. Deferred taxes related to global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI) are also recognized for the future tax effects of temporary differences.
We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position, based on its technical merits, will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authority. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution.
Following is the composition of income tax expense:
(1)
The 2024, 2023, and 2022 current tax expense includes $
129.9
million, $
69.3
million, and $
189.5
million of tax benefit, respectively, from utilization of net operating loss and other tax carryforwards.
