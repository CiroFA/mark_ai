Income taxes are determined by each subsidiary on a standalone basis according to income tax law of each jurisdiction. The Company’s consolidated effective tax rate for year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to 2023, decreased from
36.6
% to
21.4
% largely as a result of i) no foreign exchange losses recognition during the year related to the acquisition of Company's common stock in the Argentine market, which was considered as a non-deductible expense (please see Note 24 – Share repurchase program for further information); and (ii) lower taxable foreign exchange gains accounted for in Argentina for local tax purposes that are not recorded for accounting purposes since, under U.S. GAAP, the Argentine operations’ functional currency is the U.S. dollar due to the highly inflationary status of the country. This decrease was partially offset by lower reversal of the valuation allowance in the year 2024 as compared to 2023.
