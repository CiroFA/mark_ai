We have an unsecured commercial paper program, which provides for the issuance of up to $4.5 billion of commercial paper. Net proceeds from this program are used for general corporate purposes. At

, we had no amounts of commercial paper outstanding. On August 8, 2024, we entered into a Revolving Credit Facility, replacing our prior Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Facility. The Revolving Credit Facility provides for unsecured revolving facility loans, swing line loans and letters of credit in an aggregate amount of up to $4.0 billion, which expires on August 8, 2029. At
September 29, 2024
, no amounts were outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility.
We expect to issue new debt in the future. The amount and timing of any such new debt will depend on a number of factors, including but not limited to maturities of our existing debt, acquisitions and strategic investments, favorable and/or acceptable interest rates and changes in corporate income tax law. Additional information regarding our outstanding debt at

is provided in this Annual Report in “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 6. Debt.”

, our remaining future payments were $1.0 billion for a one-time U.S. repatriation tax accrued in fiscal 2018, after application of certain tax credits, which is payable in installments over the next two years. At
September 29, 2024
, other current liabilities included $530 million for the next installment due in January 2025.

As a result, our cash flows from operations are adversely affected due to significantly higher cash tax payments. However, the adverse cash flow impact will diminish in future years as capitalized research and
