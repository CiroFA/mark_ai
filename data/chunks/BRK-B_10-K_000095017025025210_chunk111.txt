The effect of discount rate changes on long-duration insurance contracts, recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income, are excluded from float, as such amounts are not included in earnings in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings.
Float was approximately $171 billion at December 31, 2024, $169 billion at December 31, 2023 and $164 billion at December 31, 2022.

Our combined insurance operations generated pre-tax underwriting gains in 2024 and 2023, and the average cost of float was negative in each year. The cost of float in 2022 was nominal.
