to 20.6% in 2023, which was primarily driven by changes in the geographic mix of sales to our large global customers.
Cost of Revenue and Gross Margin
Cost of revenue increased by $524.3 million, or 30.7% for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to 2022. These increases were primarily driven by a corresponding increase in product and service revenues, combined with an increase in provisions for excess/obsolete inventory and supplier liability charges.
Gross margin increased from 61.1% for the year ended December 31, 2022 to 61.9% for the year ended December 31, 2023. These changes reflect an improvement in product margins driven by a lower mix of revenue from our larger customers, partly offset by an increase in excess/obsolete inventory-related charges. In addition, our gross margin benefited in 2023 from the leverage of relatively fixed overhead costs on a higher revenue base.

Operating Expenses (in thousands, except percentages)
Research and development
Research and development expenses increased by $126.5 million, or 17.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to 2022. The increase was primarily due to a $84.1 million increase in personnel costs driven by an increase in headcount, and a $40.7 million increase in new product introduction costs, including non-recurring engineering costs and prototype expenses as we expand our product portfolio.
Sales and marketing
Sales and marketing expenses increased by $72.1 million, or 22.0%, for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to 2022. The increase was primarily caused by increased personnel costs driven by headcount growth, in addition to increased sales and marketing events and field demonstration costs.
General and administrative
General and administrative expenses increased by $25.8 million, or 27.7%, for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to 2022. The increase was primarily caused by an increase in personnel costs driven by increased stock-based compensation, and increased legal and professional fees.
Other Income, Net (in thousands, except percentages)
The favorable movement in other income (expense), net, during the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to 2022 was driven by an increase in interest income of $124.9 million due to an increase in our cash and investments balances and higher interest rates.
Provision for Income Taxes (in thousands, except percentages)
Our provision for income taxes increased in 2023, as compared to 2022, and our effective tax rate decreased in 2023 as compared to 2022. The increase in our income taxes was largely due to an increase in pre-tax income, partly offset by an

increase in tax benefits attributable to stock-based compensation. The decrease in our effective tax rate was primarily due to a reduction of unrecognized tax benefits on uncertain tax positions due to the expiration of the statute of limitations.
