assets that are realizable.
For the year ended December 31, 2024, the tax benefit on certain unrealized capital losses in our investment portfolio was reduced by a valuation allowance of $
633
million necessary due to limitations on the utilization of these losses for tax purposes. As part of evaluating whether it was more likely than not that we could record a tax benefit on these losses, we considered realized gains, carryback capacity and available tax planning strategies.
At December 31, 2024, Chubb has net operating loss carry-forwards of $
500
million which, if unused, will expire starting in 2025, and a U.S. life capital loss carry-forward of $
26
million which, if unused, will expire starting in 2028.

The following table presents a reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits:
At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the gross unrecognized tax benefits of $
130
million and $
73
million, respectively, can be reduced by $
18
million and $
19
million, respectively, associated with foreign tax credits. The net amounts of $
112
million and $
54
million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, if recognized, would favorably affect the effective tax rate. It is reasonably possible that over the next twelve months, that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits may change further resulting from the re-evaluation of unrecognized tax benefits arising from examinations by taxing authorities and the lapses of statutes of limitations.
Chubb recognizes accruals for interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in Income tax expense in the Consolidated statements of operations. Tax-related interest expense and penalties reported in the Consolidated statements of operations were $
6
million, $
7
million, and $
4
million at December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. Liabilities for tax-related interest and penalties in our Consolidated balance sheets were $
30
million and $
25
million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
