including technology services, and operating errors, process delays and failures or failures to comply with data usage requirements with respect to these service providers may adversely impact BlackRock. Data providers commonly disclaim the accuracy and completeness of data and BlackRock does not have the ability to validate or verify the accuracy and completeness of commercially sourced datasets. Moreover, in situations where BlackRock has limited access to alternative vendors, or where the nature of BlackRock’s arrangement with a vendor requires a long term-commitment, BlackRock may be dependent on such vendor for continuous operational reliability and may incur additional costs if such vendor introduces required upgrades to its services.
BlackRock may from time to time transfer key contracts from one third-party provider to another. Key contract transfers may be costly and complex and expose BlackRock to heightened operational and legal risks. Any failure to mitigate such risks could result in reputational harm as well as financial losses to BlackRock and its clients. The failure or inability of BlackRock to diversify its sources for key services or the failure of any key third-party provider to fulfill its obligations could result in activities inconsistent with clients’ investment management or other agreements, have an adverse financial impact on BlackRock products or lead to operational, legal and regulatory issues for the Company, which could result in reputational harm or legal liability, fines and/or sanctions and may cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
Any disruption to the Company’s distribution channels may cause BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.
BlackRock relies on a number of third parties to provide distribution, portfolio administration and servicing for certain BlackRock investment management products and services through their various distribution channels. BlackRock’s ability to maintain strong relationships with its distributors may impact the Company’s future performance, and its relationships with distributors are subject to periodic renegotiation that may result in increased distribution costs and/or reductions in the amount of BlackRock products and services being marketed or distributed. Moreover, new fiduciary regulations could lead to significant shifts in distributors' business models and more limited product offerings, potentially resulting in reduced distribution and/or marketing of certain of the Company’s products and services and fee compression. If BlackRock is unable to distribute its products and services successfully or if it is unable to replace or renew existing distribution arrangements, BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings may decline. In addition, improper activities, as well as inadequate anti-money laundering and sanctions diligence conducted by third-party distributors, could create reputational and regulatory harm to BlackRock.
