state and foreign NOL carryforwards for financial reporting purposes were approximately $
167
million, $
701
million and $
4
million, respectively, less than our NOL carryforwards for federal, state and foreign income tax purposes, due to unrecognized tax benefits of the same amount. The unrecognized tax benefit amounts exclude offsetting tax effects of $
181
million in other jurisdictions.
As of December 31, 2024, we have research and development, corporate alternative minimum tax and other general business credit carryforwards with a combined value of $
582
million for federal income tax purposes, an immaterial amount of which begins to expire in 2039.
As of December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, our valuation allowance was $
259
million, $
306
million and $
375
million, respectively. The change from December 31, 2023 to December 31, 2024 primarily related to a reduction in the valuation allowance against federal and state deferred tax assets resulting from a change in expected utilization of accumulated capital losses. The change from December 31, 2022 to December 31, 2023 primarily related to a reduction in the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets in certain state jurisdictions resulting from expiration of the related state tax attributes.
We file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and in various state and foreign jurisdictions. We are currently under examination by various states. Management does not believe the resolution of any of the audits will result in a material change to our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. The IRS has concluded audits of certain of our federal tax returns, most recently the 2020 tax year; however, NOL and other carryforwards for certain prior periods remain open for examination. U.S. federal, state and foreign examination for years prior to 2005 are generally closed.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits were as follows:

Index for Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
As of December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, we had $
1.3
billion, $
1.3
billion and $
962
million, respectively, in unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect our annual effective tax rate. Penalties and interest on income tax assessments are included in Selling, general and administrative and Interest expense, respectively, on our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. The accrued interest and penalties associated with unrecognized tax benefits are insignificant. It is possible that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits related to our uncertain tax positions may change within the next 12 months.
