NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
U.S. federal taxes have been recorded on approximately $
40
billion of undistributed foreign earnings as of December 31, 2024. A provision has not been made for certain U.S. state income taxes or additional non-U.S. taxes that would be due when cash is repatriated to the U.S. as the company’s undistributed foreign earnings are intended to be reinvested outside of the U.S. indefinitely. The determination of the amount of the unrecognized deferred tax liability related to the undistributed foreign earnings is not practicable due to the uncertainty in the manner in which these earnings will be distributed. The company’s intent is to only make distributions from non-U.S. subsidiaries in the future when they can be made at no net tax cost.
Unrecognized Tax Benefits
As of December 31, 2024, the company had $
0.52
billion of unrecognized tax benefits substantially all of which, if recognized, would reduce the effective tax rate.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amounts of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:
Substantially all of the unrecognized tax benefits are classified as long-term liabilities. The company does not expect its unrecognized tax benefits to change significantly over the next twelve months.
During 2024, the company’s unrecognized tax benefits decreased by $
99
million as a result of uncertain tax positions relating to foreign tax positions which included $
240
million of reserve and associated interest from the settlement of international tax audits for tax years 2009 through 2016 and increased $
84
million relating to U.S. federal and state tax positions.
During 2023, the company’s unrecognized tax benefits decreased by $
12
million as a result of uncertain tax positions relating to foreign tax positions and decreased $
19
million relating to U.S. federal and state tax positions.
During 2022, the company’s unrecognized tax benefits increased by $
143
million as a result of uncertain tax positions relating to foreign tax positions and decreased $
610
million relating to U.S. federal and state tax positions which included $
658
million from the settlement of the IRS audit of the 2017 and 2018 tax years. The company also assumed $
15
million of uncertain tax benefits as part of the acquisition of PPD.
The company classified interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense. The total amount of interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions and recognized in the balance sheet as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 was $
75
million and $
95
million, respectively.
The company conducts business globally and, as a result, Thermo Fisher or one or more of its subsidiaries files income tax returns
