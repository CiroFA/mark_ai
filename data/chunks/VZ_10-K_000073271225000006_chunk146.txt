net pre-tax severance charges of $
531
million and $
319
million, respectively in Selling, general and administrative expense in our consolidated statements of income.
During 2024, in accordance with our accounting policy to recognize actuarial gains and losses in the period in which they occur, we recorded net pre-tax pension and benefits credits of $
657
million in our pension and postretirement benefit plans. The net gain was recorded in Other income (expense), net, in our consolidated statement of income. This was primarily driven by a credit of $
1.4
billion ($
764
million for pension plans and $
656
million for postretirement benefit plans) due to an increase in our discount rate assumption used to determine the current year liabilities of our pension plans from a weighted-average of
5.0
% for both our pension and post retirement plans at December 31, 2023 to a weighted-average of
5.8
% for our pension plans and
5.6
% for our postretirement benefit plans at December 31, 2024; a charge of $
1.0
billion due to the difference between our estimated and our actual return on plan assets; and a net pre-tax settlement credit of $
200
million resulting from the pension annuitization transaction discussed above.

534
million due to an increase in our healthcare cost trend rate assumption used to determine the current year liabilities of our postretirement benefit plans from a weighted-average of
6.6
% at December 31, 2022 to a weighted-average of
7.3
% at December 31, 2023; a charge of $
503
million due to a decrease in our discount rate assumption used to determine the current year liabilities of our pension plans ($
288
million) and postretirement benefit plans ($
215
million) from a weighted-average of
5.2
% at December 31, 2022 to a weighted-average of
5.0
% at December 31, 2023; a net credit of $
45
million primarily due to changes in other actuarial assumption adjustments, which includes the difference between our estimated and our actual return on plan assets.
