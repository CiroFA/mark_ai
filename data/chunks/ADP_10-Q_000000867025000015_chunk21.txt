HCM technology, Providing Unmatched Expertise and Outsourcing Solutions, and Leveraging our Global Scale for the Benefit of our Clients. Executing on our Strategic Priorities will be critical to enabling our growth in the years ahead.
During the third quarter, we continued to make meaningful progress on our Strategic Priorities. We continued to integrate WorkForce Software, which we acquired in October, into our global HCM ecosystem to better serve mid-sized and large, global enterprises. We augmented our global payroll capabilities by acquiring PEI (Procesamiento Externo de Informacion, S.C.) in Mexico in January, enhancing the experience provided to our local and global clients and we continued to make broad-based improvements to our products and overall client experience resulting in continued improvement in client satisfaction scores.
Highlights from the nine months ended March 31, 2025 include:
•
Revenue growth of 7% to $15,434.1 million; 7% organic constant currency
•
Earnings before income taxes margin expansion of 50 bps, and adjusted EBIT margin expansion of 60 bps

For the nine months ended March 31, 2025, we delivered solid revenue growth of 7%, 7% organic constant currency. Our pays per control metric, which represents the number of employees on ADP clients' payrolls in the United States when measured on a same-store-sales basis for a subset of clients ranging from small to large businesses, grew 1% for the nine months ended March 31, 2025 as compared to the nine months ended March 31, 2024. PEO average worksite employees increased 3% for the nine months ended March 31, 2025, as compared to the nine months ended March 31, 2024.
We have a strong business model, generating significant cash flows with low capital intensity, and offer a suite of products that provide critical support to our clients’ HCM functions. We generate sufficient free cash flow to satisfy our cash dividend and our modest debt obligations, which enables us to absorb the impact of downturns and remain steadfast in our re-investments, longer term strategy, and commitments to shareholder friendly actions. We are committed to building upon our past successes by investing in our business through enhancements in research and development and by driving meaningful transformation in the way we operate. Our financial condition remained solid at March 31, 2025, leaving us well positioned to support our clients and our associates.
