The operating results presented for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for any other interim period or for the entire year.

Inc.'s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024 filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") on February 28, 2025 (our "Annual Report"), and the financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements included therein.
