on its business. To the extent that investigations or inquiries result in additional commitments, fines, damages, or other remedies, the Company's business, financial condition, and results of operations could be harmed.
The Company is unable to predict how any current or future investigations or litigation may be resolved or the long-term impact of any such resolution on its business. For example, competition and consumer-law-related investigations, legislation, or issues could result in private litigation and the Company is currently involved in such litigation. More immediate results could include, among other things, the imposition of fines, payment of damages, commitments to change certain business practices, or reputational damage, any of which could harm the Company's business, results of operations, brands, or competitive position.

Tax Matters
Between December 2018 and August 2021, the Italian tax authorities issued assessments on Booking.com's Italian subsidiary totaling approximately
251
million Euros ($
260
million) for the tax years 2013 through 2018, asserting that its transfer pricing policies were inadequate. The Company believes Booking.com has been and continues to be in compliance with Italian tax law. In September 2020, the Italian tax authorities approved the opening of a mutual agreement procedure ("MAP") between Italy and the Netherlands for the 2013 tax year and the Italian tax authorities subsequently approved the inclusion of the tax years 2014 through 2018 in the MAP. Based on the Company's expectation that the Italian assessments for 2013 through 2018, and any transfer pricing assessments received for subsequent open years, will be settled through the MAP process, and after considering potential resolution amounts,
33
million Euros ($
34
million) have been reflected in net unrecognized tax benefits, the majority of which is recorded to "Other assets, net" in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2024 and 2023. This unrecognized tax benefit is partially offset by a deferred income tax benefit of
15
million Euros ($
16
million). As of December 31, 2024, the Company made prepayments of
74
million Euros ($
77
million) to the Italian tax authorities to forestall collection enforcement pending the appeal phase of the case. The payments do not constitute an admission that the Company owes the taxes and will be refunded (with interest) to the Company to the extent that the Company prevails. The payments are included in "Other assets, net" in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2024 and 2023.
In June 2024, the Guardia di Finanza ("GdF") of Rome issued a tax audit report to Booking.com, proposing a tax assessment to the Italian Tax Authorities ("ITA") of
396
million Euros ($
410
million), excluding penalties and interest, for June 2017 through December 2023. The GdF alleged that a 2017 law (the "STR Law") obliged Booking.com to withhold and remit 21% of the total transaction value for the income tax
