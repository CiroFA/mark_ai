Interest Rate Risk
We are exposed to changes in interest rates, primarily on our short-term debt and the portion of long-term debt that carries floating interest rates. As of March 31, 2025, approximately 77% of the aggregate principal amount of our total debt portfolio consisted of fixed-rate indebtedness, including the effect of interest rate swap agreements designated as hedges. The impact of a 100-basis-point change in interest rates affecting our floating rate debt would result in a change in annual interest expense, including our interest rate swap agreements that are designated as hedges, of approximately $342 million. The interest rates on our existing long-term debt obligations are unaffected by changes to our credit ratings.
Interest Rate Swaps
We enter into interest rate swaps to achieve a targeted mix of fixed and variable rate debt. We principally receive fixed rates and pay variable rates, resulting in a net increase or decrease to Interest expense. These swaps are designated as fair value hedges

and hedge against interest rate risk exposure of designated debt issuances.

At both March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, the total notional amount of the interest rate swaps was $24.0 billion.
Foreign Currency Risk
The functional currency for our foreign operations is primarily the local currency. The translation of income statement and balance sheet amounts of our foreign operations into U.S. dollars is recorded as cumulative translation adjustments, which are included in Accumulated other comprehensive loss in our condensed consolidated balance sheets. Gains and losses on foreign currency transactions are recorded in the condensed consolidated statements of income. At March 31, 2025, our primary translation exposure was to the British Pound Sterling, Euro, Australian Dollar and Swedish Krona.
Cross Currency Swaps
We have entered into cross currency swaps to exchange our British Pound Sterling, Euro, Swiss Franc, Canadian Dollar and Australian Dollar-denominated cash flows into U.S. dollars and to fix our cash payments in U.S. dollars, as well as to mitigate the impact of foreign currency transaction gains or losses. At March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, the fair value of the asset of these contracts was $528 million and $500 million, respectively. At March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, the fair value of the liability of these contracts was $2.4 billion and $2.7 billion, respectively. At March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, the total notional amount of the cross currency swaps was $31.7 billion and $32.1 billion, respectively.
Foreign Exchange Forwards
We also have foreign exchange forwards which we use as an economic hedge but for which we have elected not to apply hedge accounting. We entered into Euro foreign exchange forwards to mitigate our foreign exchange
