When credit spreads widen, it becomes more expensive for JPMorganChase to borrow. JPMorganChase’s credit spreads may widen or narrow not only in response to events and circumstances that are specific to JPMorganChase but also as a result of general economic and geopolitical events and conditions. Changes in JPMorganChase’s credit spreads will affect, positively or negatively, JPMorganChase’s earnings on certain liabilities, such as derivatives, that are recorded at fair value.
JPMorganChase’s results may be materially affected by market fluctuations and significant changes in the valuation of financial instruments.
The value of securities, derivatives and other financial instruments which JPMorganChase owns or in which it makes markets can be materially affected by market fluctuations. Market volatility, illiquid market conditions and other disruptions in the financial markets may make it extremely difficult to value certain financial instruments. Subsequent valuations of financial instruments in future periods, in light of factors then prevailing, may result in significant changes in the value of these instruments. In addition, at the time of any disposition of these financial instruments, the price that JPMorganChase ultimately realizes will depend on the demand and liquidity in the market at that time and may be materially lower than their current fair value. Any of these factors could cause a decline in the value of financial instruments that JPMorganChase owns or in which it makes markets, which may have an adverse effect on JPMorganChase’s results of operations.
JPMorganChase’s risk management and monitoring processes, including its stress testing framework, seek to quantify and manage JPMorganChase’s exposure to more extreme market moves. However, JPMorganChase’s hedging and other risk management strategies may not be effective, and it could incur significant losses, if extreme market events were to occur.
