As a result, our competitors may, and in some cases will, acquire and engage users or generate advertising or other revenue at the expense of our own efforts, which would negatively affect our business and financial results. In addition, from time to time, we may take actions in response to competitive threats, but we cannot assure you that these actions will be successful or that they will not negatively affect our business and financial results.

marketing and selling efforts, including our ability to measure the effectiveness of our ads and to provide marketers with a compelling return on their investments;
•
our ability to establish and maintain developers' interest in building applications that integrate with our products;
•
our ability to establish and maintain publisher interest in integrating their content with our products;
•
changes mandated by legislation, regulatory authorities, or litigation, some of which may have a disproportionate effect on us;

our ability to cost-effectively manage our operations; and
