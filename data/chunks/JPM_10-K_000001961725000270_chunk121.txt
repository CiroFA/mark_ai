the world have adopted and are considering the adoption of numerous legislative and regulatory initiatives concerning privacy, data protection and security. Litigation or enforcement actions relating to these laws, rules and regulations could result in fines or orders requiring that JPMorganChase change its data-related practices, which could have an adverse effect on JPMorganChase’s ability to provide products and otherwise harm its business operations.
Implementing processes relating to JPMorganChase’s collection, use, sharing and storage of personal information to comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations in all relevant jurisdictions, including where the laws of different jurisdictions are in conflict, can:
•
increase JPMorganChase’s compliance and operating costs
•
hinder the development of new products or services, curtail the offering of existing products or services, or affect how products and services are offered to clients and customers
•
demand significant oversight by JPMorganChase’s management, and
•
require JPMorganChase to structure its businesses, operations and systems in less efficient ways.
Not all of JPMorganChase’s clients, customers, vendors, counterparties and other external parties may have appropriate controls in place to protect the confidentiality, integrity or availability of the
information exchanged between them and JPMorganChase, particularly where information is transmitted by electronic means. JPMorganChase could be exposed to litigation or regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions if personal information of clients, customers, employees or others were to be mishandled or misused, such as situations where such information is:
•
erroneously provided to parties who are not permitted to have the information, or
•
intercepted or otherwise compromised by unauthorized third parties.
The increasing sophistication of artificial intelligence technologies poses a greater risk of identity fraud, as malicious actors may exploit artificial intelligence to create convincing false identities or manipulate verification processes. This challenge necessitates ongoing enhancements to client verification systems and security protocols to prevent unauthorized access and protect sensitive client information. Failure to manage these risks or to implement effective countermeasures could lead to unauthorized transactions, financial losses, reputational damage and increased regulatory scrutiny.
Concerns regarding the effectiveness of JPMorganChase’s measures to safeguard personal information, or the perception that those measures are inadequate, could cause JPMorganChase to lose existing or potential clients and customers or employees, and thereby reduce JPMorganChase’s revenues. Furthermore, any failure or perceived failure by JPMorganChase to comply with applicable privacy or data protection laws, rules and regulations, or any failure to appropriately calibrate, manage and monitor access by employees or third parties to
