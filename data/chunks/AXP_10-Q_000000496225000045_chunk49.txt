NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Unaudited)
Fair Value Hedges
We are exposed to interest rate risk associated with our fixed-rate debt obligations. At the time of issuance, certain fixed-rate long-term debt obligations are designated in fair value hedging relationships, using interest rate swaps, to economically convert the fixed interest rate to a floating interest rate. We had $
23.1
billion and $
18.9
billion of fixed-rate debt obligations designated in fair value hedging relationships as of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively.
The following table presents the gains and losses recognized in Interest expense on the Consolidated Statements of Income associated with the fair value hedges of our fixed-rate long-term debt for the three months ended March 31:
Table 8.2: Gains and Losses associated with Fair Value Hedges on Fixed-rate Long Term Debt
The carrying values of the hedged liabilities, recorded within Long-term debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, were $
23.3
billion and $
18.9
billion as of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively, including the cumulative amount of fair value hedging adjustments of $
290
million and $
27
million for the respective periods.
We recognized in Interest expense on Long-term debt net increases of $
12
million and $
63
million for the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively, primarily related to the net settlements including interest accruals on our interest rate derivatives designated as fair value hedges.
Net Investment Hedges
We primarily designate foreign currency derivatives as net investment hedges to reduce our exposure to changes in currency exchange rates on our investments in non-U.S. subsidiaries.
We had notional amounts of approximately $
14.3
billion of foreign currency derivatives designated as net investment hedges as of both March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024. The gain or loss on net investment hedges, net of taxes, recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (AOCI) as part of the cumulative translation adjustment, was a loss of $
198
million and a gain of $
86
million for the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively. Net investment hedge reclassifications out of AOCI into the Consolidated Statements of Income were
no
t significant for both the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024.
Derivatives Not Designated as Hedges
The changes in the fair value of derivatives that are not designated as hedges are primarily intended to offset the related foreign exchange gains or losses of the underlying foreign currency exposures. We had notional amounts of approximately $
30.5
billion and $
28.8
billion as of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively. The changes in the fair value of the derivatives and the related underlying foreign currency exposures resulted in net gains of $
15
million and $
16
million for the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively, that are recognized
