Changes in the tax laws of foreign jurisdictions could arise as a result of the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting project undertaken by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”), which recommended changes to numerous long-standing tax principles.  Many countries have enacted the OECD’s framework on a global minimum tax (referred to as “Pillar Two”), effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2023. PMI has determined that Pillar Two did not have a material impact on its 2024 consolidated financial statements.
At December 31, 2017, PMI recorded a one-time transition tax liability on its accumulated foreign earnings, which is payable over an eight-year period beginning in 2018. At December 31, 2023, $
0.3
billion of PMI's remaining long-term portion of transition tax liability was recorded in "income taxes and other liabilities" on PMI's consolidated balance sheets. At December 31, 2024, PMI had
no
remaining long-term portion of transition tax liability as the final transition tax payment is anticipated to be made in the second quarter of 2025.

At December 31, 2024 and 2023, applicable U.S. federal income taxes have not been provided on approximately $
1.6
billion and $
0.6
billion, respectively, of accumulated earnings of Swedish Match U.S. subsidiaries that are expected to be permanently reinvested.  PMI does not foresee a need to repatriate these earnings since its U.S. cash requirements are supported by distributions of earnings from PMI foreign entities that have not been designated as permanently reinvested and existing credit facilities. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, PMI has determined the amount of deferred tax liabilities related to these unremitted Swedish Match U.S. earnings was approximately $
192
million and $
71
million, respectively.
At December 31, 2024 and 2023, U.S. federal and foreign deferred income taxes have been provided on all accumulated earnings of PMI's foreign subsidiaries.
PMI is regularly examined by tax authorities around the world and is currently under examination in a number of jurisdictions.  The U.S. federal statute of limitations on assessment remains open for the years 2019 and onward. Foreign and U.S. state jurisdictions have statutes of limitations generally ranging from
3
to
5
years after the filing of a return. Years still open to examination by foreign tax authorities in major jurisdictions include Germany (2018 onward), Indonesia (2019 onward), Italy (2019 onward), Russia (2021 onward) and Switzerland (2020 onward).
Subsidiaries of PMI in Indonesia, principally PT Hanjaya Mandala Sampoerna Tbk ("HMS"), have recorded income tax receivables in the amount of
4.0
trillion Indonesian rupiah (approximately $
249
million) relating to corporate income tax assessments paid to avoid potential penalties, primarily for domestic and other intercompany transactions for the years 2015 to 2021. Objection letters have been filed with the Tax Office and these assessments are being
