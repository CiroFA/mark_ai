2024 from 2023, primarily due to gross sales margin rate increases from lower sales markdowns, lower manufacturing costs and increased gains on asset sales, as well as from the favorable effects of past restructuring and cost management efforts. The earnings increase at Duracell was attributable to increased gross sales margins and lower selling, general and administrative expenses, including lower restructuring costs. The decline in earnings from Jazwares in 2024 was primarily due to increased amortization expense, as well as reduced orders from retailers during the fourth quarter.
2023 versus 2022
Consumer products group revenues declined $1.5 billion (9.4%) in 2023 versus 2022. The decline reflected lower revenues at Forest River and our apparel and footwear operations, partially offset by the impact of the Jazwares acquisition, which contributed revenues of $1.3 billion in 2023 and $240 million in 2022.
Forest River revenues declined 26.2% in 2023 compared to 2022, reflecting a 29.3% decline in unit sales and changes in sales mix. Forest River experienced strong recreational vehicle unit sales through the first half of 2022. Through most of 2023, sales of recreational vehicles declined significantly, attributable in part to the impact of rising interest rates, inflation and other macroeconomic conditions. The decline in recreational vehicle sales was partially offset by increased sales of bus and commercial vehicles.
Revenues of our apparel and footwear businesses declined $452 million (9.4%) in 2023 compared to 2022. The decline was primarily due to reduced apparel revenues, attributable to lower unit volumes, partially offset by higher average selling prices. Duracell’s revenues in 2023 were relatively flat versus 2022.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis
Manufacturing, Service and Retailing
Pre-tax earnings of the consumer products group increased $46 million (3.0%) in 2023 compared to 2022. Pre-tax earnings in 2023 reflected the impact of the Jazwares acquisition and higher earnings from the apparel and footwear businesses, partially offset by lower earnings from Forest River and Duracell. Certain of our apparel and footwear businesses took actions in 2023 to reduce inventories and right-size operations. The Forest River earnings decline in 2023 was primarily due to the impact of lower sales volumes, while the decline at Duracell was primarily attributable to higher restructuring costs.
