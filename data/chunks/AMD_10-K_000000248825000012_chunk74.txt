million in 2024 decreased by $14 million compared to $106 million in 2023, primarily due to repayment of the 2.95% Senior Notes due in June 2024.
Other Income (expense), net
Other income (expense), net is primarily comprised of interest income from short-term investments, changes in valuation of equity investments and foreign currency transaction gains and losses.
Other income (expense), net was $181 million in 2024 compared to $197 million of Other income, net in 2023. The change was primarily due to a decrease in interest income from lower balances held in short-term investments compared to the prior year.
Income Tax Provision (Benefit)
We recorded an income tax provision of $381 million in 2024 and an income tax benefit of $346 million in 2023, representing effective tax rates of 19% and (68%), respectively. The increase in income tax provision in 2024 was primarily due to higher pre-tax income and a $373 million tax effect from an intercompany integration transaction.
Global Minimum Tax
The OECD is continuing discussions surrounding fundamental changes in allocation of profits among tax jurisdictions in which companies do business, as well as the implementation of a global minimum tax (namely the “Pillar One” and “Pillar Two” proposals). The Council of the European Union has adopted the global corporate 15% minimum tax as provided for in Pillar Two and has directed EU member states to implement legislation enacting Pillar Two. Many countries, including non-EU member states, have implemented laws based on Pillar Two proposals, with effective dates that started in 2024. Although many countries have already introduced Pillar Two legislation applicable to us effective in 2024, certain jurisdictions in which we operate have not adopted corresponding legislation to date. For 2024, the impact to us associated with Pillar Two was immaterial. We continue to evaluate the impact of proposed and enacted legislative changes to our effective tax rate and cash flows as new guidance becomes available.
International Sales
International sales as a percentage of net revenue were
66%
in 2024 and 65% in 2023. We expect that international sales will continue to be a significant portion of total sales in the foreseeable future. Substantially all of our sales transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars.
