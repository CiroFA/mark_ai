customer and consumer policies, commitments, preferences, and considerations related to climate change, in some cases have adversely
affected, and may continue to affect, the demand for and the competitiveness of products, solutions, and services related to fossil fuel-
based power generation, including sales of new gas turbines and the utilization and servicing needs for existing gas power plants that are
unmitigated with capabilities such as hydrogen or carbon capture. Conversely, increased government policy focus on fossil fuel generation
and use, and reversion of existing policies to facilitate implementation of renewable energy sources in the various jurisdictions in which our
products are sold, may result in reduced demand for our renewable energy products and services, including decarbonization.
Continued shifts toward greater penetration by renewables in both new capacity additions and the proportionate share of power generation,
particularly depending on the pace and timeframe for such shifts across different industries globally, could have a material adverse effect on
the performance of our Power segment and our consolidated results. We also face risks and uncertainties for those businesses related to
future levels and timeframes of government subsidies and credits (including the impact of the IRA in the U.S. and other U.S. and global
policies), timeframes for negotiations with regulators, significant price competition among product manufacturers, competition with solar
power-based and other sources of renewable energy, the risk that a segment of the renewable energy industry may be deprioritized, the
pace at which power grids are modernized to maintain reliability with higher levels of renewables penetration, and industry-wide shifts in
profitability levels.
Our long-term success depends on our ability to effectively address both electrification and decarbonization, which over time will require
adapting our technology portfolio to changing customer preferences and government policies and scaling innovative low-carbon and
carbon-neutral technologies. If we fail or are perceived to not be adequately advancing decarbonization objectives, or if investors or
financial institutions shift funding away from companies in fossil fuel-related industries, our and our customersâ€™ access to capital could be
negatively impacted. Furthermore, governments may enact or implement policies that impact these dynamics as they pertain to us or our
customers in unforeseeable ways. The achievement of decarbonization goals for the electric power industry over the coming decades is
also likely to depend in part on technologies that are not yet deployed or widely adopted today but that may become more important over
time (such as hydrogen-based power generation, carbon capture and sequestration technologies, small modular or other advanced nuclear
power and grid-scale batteries or other
