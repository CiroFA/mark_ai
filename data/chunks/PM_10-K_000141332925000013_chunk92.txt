we are developing and commercializing a portfolio of products intended to appeal to a variety of distinct adult consumer preferences and achieve population harm reduction, including:
•
Heat-not-burn products, which use a precisely controlled heating device incorporating our
IQOS HeatControl
technology, into which a specially designed and proprietary tobacco unit is inserted in a holder and heated to generate an aerosol. We have conducted a series of clinical studies for this platform, the results of which were included in our submissions to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”). In addition to the original version of
IQOS
, which relies on a heating technology using a blade, a newer version of
IQOS
uses induction heating. Most of the studies referenced above were conducted with the blade version of
IQOS
and additional research was conducted with the induction technology. We believe that there is full comparability between the bladed versions of
IQOS
and the subsequent induction versions of
IQOS
, and that the data from the studies conducted with the blade version of
IQOS
remain valid and applicable to the newer and adjacent versions of
IQOS
. In 2022, we also began the initial launch of a heat-not-burn product that utilizes external resistive heating technology and is commercialized under the
BONDS
by
IQOS
brand.

Oral tobacco and nicotine products, which include snus and modern oral nicotine pouches. Snus refers to (a) dried loose tobacco, or snuff, which is consumed by sniffing the product through the nose; (b) moist loose tobacco which is put in the mouth between the lower or upper lip and gum; and (c) snus pouches which contain ground tobacco, water, salt and flavors. Modern oral nicotine pouches consist of white pre-conditioned pouches containing nicotine derived from tobacco, and they primarily contain nicotine, flavors, and cellulose substrate. Users place a pouch between the upper lip and gum and leave it there while the nicotine and flavor are being released. Like snus, nicotine pouches are inherently smoke-free as they are consumed orally, and no combustion process occurs during use. The pouches contain pharmaceutical-grade tobacco-derived nicotine like the nicotine used in medicinal products, such as nicotine-containing gums and inhalers, and flavors approved for use in food in accordance with the product quality standards for nicotine pouches developed by the Swedish Institute for Standards and the British Standards Institute. In 2022, we significantly expanded our oral smokeless products portfolio with the acquisition of Swedish Match. Swedish Match's
ZYN
is the leading nicotine pouch brand in the U.S. market.
•
e-Vapor products, which are battery-powered devices that produce an aerosol by vaporizing a tobacco-free liquid solution. We have developed e-liquids for our e-Vapor products designed to deliver an authentic tobacco taste. Using patented technology, flavors and nicotine are extracted directly from the tobacco leaves
