to satisfy these leverage- and risk-based requirements could increase at any given time due to factors such as:
•
actions by banking regulators, including changes in laws, rules and regulations
Part I
•
changes in the composition of JPMorganChase’s balance sheet or developments that could increase RWA, such as increased market risk, customer delinquencies, client credit rating downgrades or other factors, and
•
increases in estimated stress losses as determined by the Federal Reserve under the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review, which could increase JPMorganChase’s SCB.
Any failure by or inability of JPMorganChase to maintain the required level and composition of capital, or unfavorable changes in applicable capital requirements, could have an adverse impact on JPMorganChase’s shareholders, such as:
•
reducing the amount of common stock that JPMorganChase is permitted to repurchase
•
requiring the issuance of, or prohibiting the redemption of, capital instruments in a manner inconsistent with JPMorganChase’s capital management strategy
•
constraining the amount of dividends that may be paid on common stock, or
•
curtailing JPMorganChase’s business activities or operations.
In 2023, U.S. banking regulators released a proposal to implement the final Basel III reforms which would have significantly revised the risk-based capital requirements for banks with assets of $100 billion or more, including JPMorganChase. In addition, in 2023 the Federal Reserve released a proposal to amend the calculation of the GSIB surcharge. Uncertainty remains regarding the content of the final versions of these rule proposals and how they might ultimately apply to JPMorganChase. However, it is possible that the final rules could impact JPMorganChase’s decisions concerning the business activities in which it will engage and its levels of capital distributions to its shareholders.

In addition to proper design, installation, maintenance and training, the effective functioning of JPMorganChase’s operational systems depends on:
•
the quality of the information contained in those systems, as inaccurate, outdated, incomplete or corrupted data can significantly compromise the
functionality or reliability of a particular system and other systems to which it transmits or from which it receives information, and
