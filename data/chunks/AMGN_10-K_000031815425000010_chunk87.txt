existing or potentially competitive therapeutics;
•
the product candidate had harmful side effects in animals or humans;
•
the necessary regulatory bodies, such as the FDA or EMA, did not approve the product candidate for an intended use;
•
reimbursement for the product candidate is limited despite regulatory approval;
•
the product candidate was not economical for us to manufacture and commercialize;
•
the patient population size is smaller than anticipated;
•
other parties had or may have had proprietary rights relating to our product candidate, such as patent rights, and did not let us sell it on reasonable terms, or at all;
•
we and certain of our licensees, partners, contracted organizations or independent investigators failed to effectively conduct clinical development or clinical manufacturing activities;
•
the pathway to regulatory approval or reimbursement for product candidates was uncertain or not well-defined;
•
the biosimilar product candidate failed to demonstrate the requisite biosimilarity to the applicable reference product, or was otherwise determined by a regulatory authority to not meet applicable standards for approval; and
•
a companion diagnostic device that is required with the use of a product candidate is not approved by the necessary regulatory authority.
We believe that genetics, together with the benefit of artificial intelligence and computational evidence, could meaningfully aid our search for new medicines and help guide our R&D decisions and investments, and have focused our R&D strategy on drug targets validated by genetic or other compelling human evidence. We have invested considerable time, energy and resources into developing our expertise in human genetics and acquiring access to libraries of genetic information, and are applying artificial intelligence to our R&D activities, including applying such technologies to advance our human data efforts and our generative biology platform that seek to discover and design new drugs. However, product candidates based on genetically validated targets or developed with the assistance of such technologies remain subject to the uncertainties of the drug development process and may not reach the market for a number of reasons, including the factors listed above.
We must conduct clinical trials in humans before we commercialize and sell any of our product candidates or existing products for new indications.
Before a product may be sold, we must conduct clinical trials to demonstrate that our product candidates are safe and effective for use in humans. The results of those clinical trials are used as the basis to obtain approval from regulatory authorities such as the FDA and EMA. See
Our current products and products in development cannot be sold without regulatory approval
. We are required to conduct clinical trials using an appropriate number of trial sites and patients to support the product label claims. The length of time, number of trial sites and number of patients
