refinancing of our term loans in the prior year period, partially offset by an increase in net foreign currency losses of $0.4 million.
Provision for Income Taxes
In the three months ended March 31, 2025, the provision for income taxes increased by $10.2 million, or 32%
,
as compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by higher pre-tax income from business operations during the three months ended March 31, 2025 and global minimum tax, partially offset by higher stock-based compensation benefit and foreign income taxed at different rates.

Comparison of our Segment Results of Operations
The following table presents the results for our Advertising and Apps segment adjusted EBITDA for the periods indicated:
Three Months Ended March 31, 2025 Compared to Three Months Ended March 31, 2024
The $451.2 million, or 92%, increase
in Advertising Adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended March 31, 2025 was primarily driven by an increase in Advertising Revenue of $480.6 million and a decrease of $4.5 million in personnel-related expenses, partially offset by an increase of $28.2 million in expenses associated with operating our network infrastructure driven by the growth in our operations.
The $5.0 million, or 9%, increase in Apps Adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended March 31, 2025 was primarily driven by a decrease of $39.2 million in user acquisition costs, a decrease of $13.2 million in third-party payment processing fees as a result of the decline in IAP revenue, and a decrease of $9.5 million in personnel-related expenses, partially offset by a decrease in Apps Revenue of $54.7 million.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
As of March 31, 2025, we had cash and cash equivalents of $551.0 million, consisting primarily of cash on deposit with banks and short-term liquid investments in money market deposit accounts. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, cash flows expected to be generated by our operations, and, if necessary, our borrowing capacity under the 2024 Credit Agreement, which provided $793.7 million of remaining availability as of March 31, 2025, would be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated working capital and capital expenditures needs for at least the next 12 months. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our revenue growth rate; sales and marketing activities; timing and extent of spending to support our research and development efforts; capital expenditures to purchase hardware and software; our continued need to invest in our IT infrastructure to support our growth; and the volume and timing of our stock repurchases. In addition, we may enter into additional strategic partnerships as well as agreements to acquire or invest in teams and technologies, including intellectual property rights, which could increase our cash requirements. As a result of these and other factors, we may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing
