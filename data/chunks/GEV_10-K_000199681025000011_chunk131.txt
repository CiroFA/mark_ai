Uncertain Tax Positions.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending liability for uncertain tax positions was as follows:
Of the
$
638
million
and
$
886
million
liability for uncertain tax positions including interest and penalties at
December 31, 2024
and
2023
,
respectively,
$
434
million
and
$
651
million
, respectively, are recorded in All other liabilities and
$
204
million
and
$
235
million
, respectively,
are recorded as a net offset to Deferred income taxes on our Combined Statement of Financial Position. If recognized,
$
318
million
and
$
251
million
of the liability for uncertain tax positions at
December 31, 2024
and
2023
, respectively, would impact our effective tax rate.
As a result of tax audit closings, settlements with tax authorities, and the expiration of applicable statutes of limitation in various
jurisdictions, it is reasonably possible that the liability for uncertain tax positions could be reduced by approximately
$
37
million
in the next
12 months.

2023
, and
2022

Annually, we file over
2,600
income tax returns in over
270
global taxing jurisdictions. We are under examination or engaged in tax litigation
in many of these jurisdictions. The IRS is currently auditing the combined GE U.S. income tax returns for 2016-2021. In December 2020,
the IRS completed the audit of the combined GE U.S. income tax returns for 2014-2015. The Company has provided for its potential tax
exposure from uncertain tax positions as part of the combined GE U.S. income tax returns as an indemnification obligation with GE in
accordance with the Tax Matters Agreement.
