Windows
The Windows operating system is designed to deliver a more personal computing experience for users by enabling consistency of experience, applications, and information across their devices. Windows OEM revenue is impacted significantly by the number of Windows operating system licenses purchased by OEMs, which they pre-install on the devices they sell. In addition to computing device market volume, Windows OEM revenue is impacted by:
•
The mix of computing devices based on form factor and screen size.
•
Differences in device market demand between developed markets and growth markets.
•
Growth of the AI PC category
•
Attachment of Windows to devices shipped.
•
Customer mix between consumer, small and medium businesses, and large enterprises.
•
Changes in inventory levels in the OEM channel.
•
Pricing changes and promotions, pricing variation that occurs when the mix of devices manufactured shifts from local and regional system builders to large multinational OEMs, and different pricing of Windows versions licensed.
•
Constraints in the supply chain of device components.
•
Piracy.
