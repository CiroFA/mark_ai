performance, technical or contractual outcomes could be different than those previously assumed creates financial risk that could trigger additional material earnings charges, termination provisions, order cancellations, or other financially significant exposure.
VC-25B Presidential Aircraft
The Company’s firm fixed-price contract for the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) effort on the U.S. Air Force’s (USAF) VC-25B Presidential Aircraft, commonly known as Air Force One, is a $
4
billion program to develop and modify
two
747-8 commercial aircraft. During 2024 and 2023, we increased the reach-forward loss on the contract by $
379
and $
482
. During the second quarter of 2024, we increased the reach-forward loss on the contract by $
250
primarily driven by higher than anticipated costs due to engineering design changes related to wiring and other structural requirements. During the fourth quarter of 2024, we increased the reach-forward loss by $
129
reflecting higher estimated costs due to engineering design changes and schedule delays. Risk remains that we may record additional losses in future periods.
KC-46A Tanker
In 2011, we were awarded a contract from the USAF to design, develop, manufacture, and deliver
four
next generation aerial refueling tankers as well as priced options for
13
annual production lots totaling
179
aircraft. Since 2016, the USAF has authorized
11
low rate initial production (LRIP) lots for a total of
154
aircraft. The EMD contract and authorized LRIP lots total approximately $
29
billion as of December 31, 2024. The KC-46A Tanker is a derivative of the 767 commercial airplane program with the majority of the manufacturing costs being incurred in the 767 factory and the remaining costs being incurred in the military finishing and delivery centers.
During 2024 and 2023, we increased the reach-forward loss on the KC-46A Tanker program by $
2,002
and $
309
. During the first quarter of 2024, we increased the reach-forward loss by $
128
, primarily due to factory disruption associated with supply chain constraints. During the second quarter of 2024, we increased the reach-forward loss on the contract by $
391
, primarily reflecting higher than anticipated factory disruption, including supply chain constraints and parts shortages. During the third quarter of 2024, we increased the reach-forward loss on the contract by $
661
to reflect higher than anticipated factory disruption, higher estimated supplier costs, the projected impacts of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers District 751 (IAM 751) contract negotiations and the ongoing work stoppage, and increased cost allocations primarily resulting from lower commercial airplane production rates. During the fourth quarter of 2024, we recorded an earnings charge of $
822
, primarily due to factory performance, higher estimated future production costs, and higher costs resulting from the IAM 751 work stoppage and new agreement. The fourth
