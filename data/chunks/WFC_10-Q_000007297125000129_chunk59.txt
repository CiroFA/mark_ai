Financial Performance
(1)
Includes provision for credit losses for loans, debt securities, and other financial assets.
In first quarter 2025, we generated $4.9 billion of net income and diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.39, compared with $4.6 billion of net income and diluted EPS of $1.20 in the same period a year ago. Financial performance for first quarter 2025, compared with first quarter 2024, included the following:
•
total revenue decreased due to lower net interest income, partially offset by higher noninterest income;
•
noninterest expense decreased due to lower operating losses, lower professional and outside services expense, and lower other expense driven by a lower Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) special assessment, partially offset by higher technology, telecommunications and equipment expense;
•
average loans decreased due to declines in our commercial real estate and residential mortgage portfolios; and
•
average deposits decreased driven by a decline in our interest-bearing deposits, partially offset by an increase in our noninterest-bearing deposits.
Capital and Liquidity
We maintained a strong capital and liquidity position in first quarter 2025, which included the following:
•
our Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio was 11.09% under the Standardized Approach (our binding ratio), which

continued to exceed the regulatory minimum and buffers of 9.80%;
•
our total loss absorbing capacity (TLAC) as a percentage of total risk-weighted assets was 25.11%, compared with the regulatory minimum of 21.50%; and
•
our liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) was 125%, which continued to exceed the regulatory minimum of 100%.
See the “Capital Management” and the “Risk Management – Asset/Liability Management – Liquidity Risk and Funding” sections in this Report for additional information regarding our capital and liquidity, including the calculation of our regulatory capital and liquidity amounts.
Credit Quality
Credit quality reflected the following:
•
The allowance for credit losses (ACL) for loans of $14.6 billion at March 31, 2025, decreased $84 million from December 31, 2024.
•
Our provision for credit losses for loans was $925 million in first quarter 2025, compared with $926 million in the same period a year ago, reflecting a decrease in net loan charge-offs, which was partially offset by the change in allowance for credit losses for loans driven by a lower allowance for commercial real estate loans on lower loan balances, partially offset by a higher allowance for commercial and industrial loans.
•
The allowance coverage for total loans was 1.59% at March 31, 2025, compared with 1.60% at December 31, 2024.
•
Commercial portfolio net loan charge-offs were $211 million, or 16 basis points of average commercial loans, in first quarter 2025, compared with net loan charge-offs of $341 million, or 25 basis
