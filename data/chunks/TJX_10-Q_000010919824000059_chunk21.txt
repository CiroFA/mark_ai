Income Taxes
In 2021, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development announced an Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting including Pillar Two Model Rules defining the global minimum tax, which calls for the taxation of large multinational corporations at a minimum rate of 15%. Subsequently multiple sets of administrative guidance have been issued. Many non-US tax jurisdictions have either recently enacted legislation to adopt certain components of the Pillar Two Model Rules beginning in 2024 with the adoption of additional components in later years or announced their plans to enact legislation in future years. Considering we do not have material operations in jurisdictions with tax rates lower than the Pillar Two minimum, these rules did not have a material impact on our financial statements for the third quarter or the first nine months of fiscal 2025 and are not expected to materially increase our global tax costs on our fiscal 2025 financial statements. There remains uncertainty as to the final Pillar Two model rules. We are continuing to evaluate the impacts of enacted legislation and pending legislation to enact Pillar Two Model Rules in the non-US tax jurisdictions we operate in.
The e
ffective income tax rate was
25.3
% for the third quarter of fiscal 2025 and
25.0
% for the third quarter of fiscal 2024. The increase in the effective income tax rate in the third quarter of fiscal 2025 was primarily due to the decrease in excess tax benefit from share-based compensation, partially offset by the resolution of various tax matters.
