Ion Procedures
The adoption of robotic-assisted bronchoscopy using the Ion endoluminal system has the potential to grow if it can offer greater patient value than non-Ion alternatives and competitive total economics for healthcare providers.
In 2024, approximately 95,500 biopsy procedures were performed with Ion systems, compared to approximately 53,800 in 2023 and approximately 23,500 in 2022. The increase in our overall procedure volume in 2024 reflects a larger installed base of approximately 805 systems, an increase of 51% compared to the installed base of approximately 534 systems as of 2023. In 2024, 2023, and 2022, the vast majority of Ion biopsy procedures were performed in the U.S.
