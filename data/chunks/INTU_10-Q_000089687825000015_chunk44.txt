expect to pay incremental U.S. taxes on repatriation. We have recorded income tax expense for Canada, India, and Israel withholding taxes on earnings that are not permanently reinvested.

On January 30, 2025, we entered into a credit agreement with certain lenders providing for a $4.5 billion unsecured short-term revolving credit facility that matures on April 30, 2025 (2025 Credit Facility) to fund a portion of our TurboTax 5-day early refund offering.
