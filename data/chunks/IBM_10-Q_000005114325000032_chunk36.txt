Anticipated Royalties and Cost Transactions
The company’s operations generate significant nonfunctional currency, third-party vendor payments and intercompany payments for royalties and goods and services among the company’s non-U.S. subsidiaries and with the company. In anticipation of these foreign currency cash flows and in view of the volatility of the currency markets, the company selectively employs foreign exchange forward contracts to manage its currency risk. These forward contracts are accounted for as cash flow hedges. At March 31, 2025, the maximum remaining length of time over which the company hedged its exposure is approximately
two years
. At March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, the total notional amount of forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges of forecasted royalty and cost transactions was $
