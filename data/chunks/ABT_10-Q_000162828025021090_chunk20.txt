Earnings
Taxes on earnings reflect the estimated annual effective rates and include charges for interest and penalties. In the first three months of 2025 and 2024, taxes on earnings include $
73
million and $
25
million, respectively, in excess tax benefits associated with share-based compensation. The 2025 taxes on earnings includes approximately $
200
million of tax expense related to a deferred tax asset that was recognized as a significant non-cash tax benefit in a prior year. In the first three months of 2024, taxes on earnings also included approximately $
10
million of tax expense as the result of the resolution of various tax positions related to prior years.
In September 2023, Abbott received a Statutory Notice of Deficiency (SNOD) from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for the 2019 Federal tax year in the amount of $
417
million. The primary adjustments proposed in the SNOD relate to the reallocation of income between Abbottâ€™s U.S. entities and its foreign affiliates. Abbott believes that the income reallocation adjustments proposed in the SNOD are without merit, in part because certain adjustments contradict methods that were agreed to with the IRS in prior audit periods. The SNOD also contains other proposed adjustments that Abbott believes are erroneous and unsupported. Abbott filed a petition with the U.S. Tax Court contesting the SNOD in December 2023.
In June 2024, Abbott received a SNOD from the IRS for the 2017 and 2018 Federal tax years in the amount of $
192
million. The matters proposed in the 2017/2018 SNOD are substantially similar to the income allocation adjustments included in the 2019 SNOD. Abbott filed a petition in September 2024 with the U.S. Tax Court contesting the 2017/2018 SNOD in a manner consistent with its petition for the 2019 SNOD.
In October 2024, Abbott received a SNOD from the IRS for the 2020 Federal tax year assessing an additional $
443
million of income tax. The primary adjustments proposed in the SNOD are substantially similar to the income allocation adjustments included in the 2017/2018 and 2019 SNODs. Abbott believes that the income reallocation adjustments proposed in the SNOD are without merit. The SNOD also contains other proposed adjustments and omissions that Abbott believes are erroneous and unsupported. In addition to the tax assessment for the 2020 tax year, the 2020 SNOD also contested a deduction for which an estimated $
440
million cash tax benefit would be available in a different taxable year as allowed under applicable U.S. tax law. Abbott filed a petition with the U.S. Tax Court contesting the SNOD in December 2024.
Abbott intends to vigorously defend its filing positions through ongoing discussions with the IRS, the IRS independent appeals process and/or through litigation as necessary. Abbott reserves for uncertain tax positions related to unresolved matters with the IRS and other taxing authorities. Abbott continues to believe that its reserves for uncertain tax positions
