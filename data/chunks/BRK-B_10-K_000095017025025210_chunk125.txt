Manufacturing, Service and Retailing
Retailing group pre-tax earnings declined $331 million (19.2%) in 2024 compared to 2023. BHA’s pre-tax earnings declined 7.9% in 2024 compared to 2023, primarily due to lower vehicle gross profit margins, partially offset by higher earnings from finance/service contract and parts/service/repair operations, as well as lower selling, general and administrative expenses. Aggregate pre-tax earnings for the remainder of our retailing group declined $242 million (40.2%) in 2024 compared to 2023. Most of these other retailers generated significantly lower earnings in 2024 compared to 2023, reflecting lower sales and gross sales margin rates and higher selling, general and administrative expenses as percentages of sales.
2023 versus 2022
Retailing group revenues increased $111 million (0.6%) in 2023 compared to 2022, reflecting an increase at BHA, partially offset by lower revenues from our other retailers. BHA’s revenues increased 3.9% in 2023 compared to 2022. Revenues from new vehicle sales increased 12.6% in 2023 compared to 2022, while revenues from pre-owned retail vehicle sales declined 9.4%. Retail unit sales increased 2.7%, reflecting an 11.7% increase in new vehicles sold and a 4.7% decrease in pre-owned vehicles sold. Revenues from BHA’s parts/service/repair operations increased 6.6% in 2023 versus 2022. Revenues of our other retailing businesses declined 5.6% in the aggregate versus 2022, due primarily to an 8.6% decline at our home furnishings businesses.
Retailing group pre-tax earnings were $1.7 billion in 2023, unchanged from 2022. BHA’s pre-tax earnings increased 17.7%, primarily due to earnings increases from the parts/service/repair and finance/service contract operations, as well as from higher investment income and lower selling, general and administrative and other expenses, partially offset by lower vehicle gross profit margin rates and higher floor plan interest expense. BHA’s comparative vehicle gross profit margin rates peaked in mid-2022 and declined through 2023. Aggregate pre-tax earnings for the remainder of our retailing group declined $168 million (21.8%) in 2023 compared to 2022, primarily due to a 28.3% decrease in home furnishings businesses earnings and the impact of a gain in 2022 from the divestiture of certain jewelry stores.
