amount considered to be indefinitely reinvested, it is not practicable to determine the amount of the related deferred income tax liability due to the complexities of the tax laws and assumptions we would have to make.
Valuation allowances are provided to reduce the amounts of our deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized based on an assessment of positive and negative evidence, including estimates of future taxable income necessary to realize future deductible amounts.
The valuation allowance increased in 2024, primarily driven by the Companyâ€™s expectation that certain state R&D credits will expire unused.
As of December 31, 2024, we had $
195
million of federal tax credit carryforwards available to reduce future federal income taxes and have provided a $
17
million valuation allowance on those federal tax credit carryforwards. The federal tax credit carryforwards expire between 2025 and 2045. We had $
1.2
billion of state tax credit carryforwards available to reduce future state income taxes and have provided a valuation allowance for $
1.1
billion of those state tax credit carryforwards. We had $
83
million of tax credit carryforwards related to our foreign jurisdictions available to offset future foreign income taxes for which we have provided a $
53
million valuation allowance.
As of December 31, 2024, we had $
239
million of federal NOL carryforwards available to reduce future federal income taxes and have provided
no

201
million of those federal NOL carryforwards have no expiration; the remainder begin to expire between 2025 and 2033. We had $
957
million of state NOL carryforwards available to reduce future state income taxes and have provided a valuation allowance for
F-25

billion of foreign NOL carryforwards available to reduce future foreign income taxes and have provided a valuation allowance for $
164
million of those foreign NOL carryforwards. For the foreign NOLs with
no
valuation allowance provided, $
160
million have no expiration; and the remainder will expire between 2025 and 2034.

million, $
