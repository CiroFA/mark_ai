Asset-backed CDOs are valued based on an evaluation of the market and model input parameters sourced from comparable instruments as indicated by market activity.
Each asset-backed CDO position is evaluated independently taking into consideration available comparable market levels, underlying collateral performance and pricing, deal structures and liquidity.
Valuation Hierarchy Classification:
•
Level 2—when either comparable market transactions are observable or credit correlation input is insignificant
•
Level 3—when either comparable market transactions are unobservable or the credit correlation input is significant
Equity Contracts with Financing Features
Valuation Techniques:
•
Fair value of certain equity contracts, which are not classified as OTC derivatives because they do not meet the net investment criteria, is determined by discounting future interest cash flows, inclusive of the estimated value of the embedded optionality. The valuation uses the same derivative pricing models and valuation techniques as described under “OTC Derivative Contracts” herein.
Valuation Hierarchy Classification:
•
Level 2—when the contract is valued using observable inputs or where the unobservable input is not deemed significant
•
Level 3—when the contract is valued using an unobservable input that is deemed significant
Corporate Equities
Valuation Techniques:
•
Exchange-traded equity securities are generally valued based on quoted prices from the exchange.
•
Unlisted equity securities are generally valued based on an assessment of each security, considering rounds of financing and third-party transactions, discounted cash flow analyses and market-based information, including comparable transactions, trading multiples and changes in market outlook, among other factors.
•
Listed fund units are generally marked to the exchange-traded price if actively traded, or to NAV if not. Unlisted fund units are generally marked to NAV.

Level 1—actively traded exchange-traded securities and fund units
•
Level 2—if not actively traded, inputs are observable or if undergoing a recent M&A event or corporate action
•
Level 3—if not actively traded, inputs are unobservable or if undergoing an aged M&A event or corporate action
