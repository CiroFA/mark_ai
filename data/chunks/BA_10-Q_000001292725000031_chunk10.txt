suppliers related to future production lots. Risk remains that we may record additional losses in future periods.
MQ-25
In the third quarter of 2018, we were awarded the MQ-25 EMD contract by the U.S. Navy. The contract is a fixed-price contract that now includes development and delivery of
seven
aircraft and test articles at a contract price of $
890
. In connection with winning the competition, we recognized a reach-forward loss of $
291
in the third quarter of 2018. In the first quarter of 2024, we were awarded a cost-type contract modification totaling $
657
for
two
additional test aircraft plus other scope increases. During 2024, we increased the reach-forward loss by $
339
. We expect the initial EMD units to complete production in 2025 and begin flight testing. During the first quarter of 2025, we initiated final assembly operations at our new facility at Mid-America St. Louis Airport in Mascoutah, Illinois. Risk remains that we may record additional losses in future periods.
T-7A Red Hawk EMD Contract & Production Options
In 2018, we were awarded the T-7A Red Hawk program. The EMD portion of the contract is a $
860
fixed-price contract and includes
five
aircraft and
seven
simulators. The production portion of the contract includes production lots for 346 T-7A Red Hawk aircraft and related services that we believe are probable of being exercised. The
five
EMD aircraft were delivered as of December 31, 2024, and the flight testing is ongoing. In January 2025, the USAF announced an updated acquisition approach for the T-7A Red Hawk that allows the Company to provide a production-ready configuration to the customer prior to low-rate initial production, which better supports the operational needs of the customer and reduces future production risk. During 2024, we increased the reach-forward loss on the T-7A Red Hawk program by $
1,770
. At March 31, 2025, we had approximately $
361
of capitalized precontract costs and $
783
of potential termination liabilities to suppliers related to certain long-lead items for the first
4
production lots. Risk remains that we may record additional losses in future periods.
Commercial Crew
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has contracted us to design and build the CST-100 Starliner spacecraft to transport crews to the International Space Station (ISS). During 2024, we increased the reach-forward loss by $
523
. We are continuing to work toward crew certification and resolve the propulsion system anomalies. At March 31, 2025, we had approximately $
401
of capitalized precontract costs and $
147
of potential termination liabilities to suppliers related to unauthorized future missions. Risk remains that we may record additional losses in future periods.

Arrangements with Off-Balance Sheet Risk
We enter into arrangements with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business, primarily in the form of guarantees.
