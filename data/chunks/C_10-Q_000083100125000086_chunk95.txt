GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS
Goodwill

Citi tests for goodwill impairment annually as of October 1 (the annual test) and conducts interim assessments between the annual test if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more-likely-than-not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. No such events or circumstances were identified as part of the qualitative assessment performed as of March 31, 2025. For additional information regarding Citi’s goodwill impairment testing process, see Notes 1 and 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Citi’s 2024 Form 10-K.
Unanticipated declines in business performance, increases
in credit losses, increases in capital requirements and adverse regulatory or legislative changes, as well as deterioration in economic or market conditions, are factors that could result in a material impairment loss to earnings in a future period related to some portion of the associated goodwill.
