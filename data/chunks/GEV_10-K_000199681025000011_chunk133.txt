EARNINGS PER SHARE INFORMATION
.
On
April 2, 2024
, there were approximately
274
million
shares of GE Vernova
common stock outstanding. The computation of basic and diluted earnings (loss) per common share for all periods through
April 1, 2024
was calculated using
274
million
common shares and is net of Net loss (income) attributable to noncontrolling interests. For periods prior to
the Spin-Off, there were no dilutive equity instruments as there were no equity awards of GE Vernova outstanding prior to the Spin-Off. The
dilutive effect of outstanding stock options, restricted stock units, and performance share units is reflected in the denominator for diluted
EPS using the treasury stock method.
(a) Diluted earnings (loss) per share excludes certain shares issuable under share-based compensation plans because the effect would
have been antidilutive.
