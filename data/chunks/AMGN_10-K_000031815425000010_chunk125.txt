The Board of Directors declared quarterly cash dividends of $2.25, $2.13 and $1.94 per share of common stock paid in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, reflecting year-over-year increases of 6% and 10% for 2024 and 2023, respectively.

We also returned capital to stockholders through our stock repurchase program. During 2024, we repurchased $200 million of common stock under the stock repurchase program. During 2023, we did not repurchase any of our common stock under the stock repurchase program. During 2022, we repurchased $6.3 billion of common stock, including $6.0 billion under ASR agreements and had cash settlements for stock repurchases of $6.4 billion. As of December 31, 2024, $6.8 billion remained available under the stock repurchase program.
As a result of stock repurchases and quarterly dividend payments, we had an accumulated deficit as of December 31, 2024 and 2023. Our accumulated deficit is not anticipated to affect our future ability to operate, repurchase stock, pay dividends or repay our debt given our expected continued profitability and strong financial position.

Unfavorable changes to these ratings may have an adverse impact on future financings.
