We invest in short-term and long-term investments as part of our cash investment strategy, the primary objective of which is to protect principal, maintain liquidity and provide yield and total returns. These investments include time deposits, commercial paper, as well as debt securities classified as available for sale. Short-term funds needed to support our operating plan and provide resiliency to react to short-term price volatility are invested in highly liquid instruments with maturities less than one year. Funds we consider available to maintain resiliency in longer term price downturns and to capture opportunities outside a given operating plan may be invested in instruments with maturities greater than one year.
See Note 10.
Investing activities in the first three months of 2025 included net purchases of $400 million of investments. We had net purchases of $261 million of short-term investments and net purchases of $139 million of long-term investments
