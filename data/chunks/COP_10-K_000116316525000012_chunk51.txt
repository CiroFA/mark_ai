environment, which are expected to continue to have an increasing impact on our operations. For a description of the most significant of these environmental laws and regulations, see the
“Contingencies—Environmental”
,
“—Climate Change”
and
"—Company Response to Climate-Related Risks"
sections of Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. These laws and regulations continue to increase in both number and complexity and affect our operations with respect to, among other things:
•
Permits required in connection with exploration, drilling, production and other activities, including those issued by national, subnational and local authorities;
•
The discharge of pollutants into the environment;
•
Emissions into the atmosphere, such as nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, mercury and GHG emissions, including methane and carbon dioxide;
•
Carbon taxes;
•
The handling, use, storage, transportation, disposal and cleanup of hazardous materials and hazardous and nonhazardous wastes;
•
The dismantlement, abandonment and restoration of historic properties and facilities at the end of their useful lives; and
•
Exploration and production activities in certain areas, such as offshore environments, arctic fields, oil sands reservoirs and unconventional plays.
We have incurred and will continue to incur substantial capital, operating and maintenance, and remediation expenditures as a result of these laws and regulations. In addition, to the extent these expenditures are assumed by a buyer as a result of a disposition, it may result in our incurring substantial costs if the buyer is unable to satisfy these obligations. Any actual or perceived failure by us to comply with existing or future laws, regulations and other requirements could result in administrative or civil penalties, criminal fines, other enforcement actions or third-party litigation against us. To the extent these expenditures, as with all costs, are not ultimately reflected in the prices of our products, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows in future periods, as well as our ability to implement and advance our Climate Risk Strategy could be adversely affected.
Existing and future laws, regulations and internal initiatives relating to global climate change, such as limitations on GHG emissions or provisions aimed at reducing such emissions, may impact or limit our business plans, result in significant expenditures, promote alternative uses of energy or reduce demand for our products.
Continuing political and societal attention to the issue of global climate change has resulted in both existing and pending international agreements and national, regional or local legislation and regulatory measures to limit GHG emissions, such as cap and trade regimes, specific emission standards, carbon taxes, restrictive permitting, increased fuel efficiency standards and incentives or mandates for renewable and alternative energy.
