Unrealized losses related to our available-for-sale debt securities are primarily due to interest rate fluctuations as opposed to credit quality. We do not intend to sell any of the securities in an unrealized loss position and it is not likely that we would be required to sell these securities before recovery of their amortized cost basis, which may be at maturity. We did not recognize any credit losses related to our available-for-sale debt securities during the years ended July 31, 2024 and 2023.
The following table summarizes the amortized cost and fair value of our available-for-sale debt securities as of July 31, 2024, by contractual years-to-maturity
