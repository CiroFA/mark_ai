Operating income increased by 9.3%. Operating income, excluding currency and acquisitions, increased by 26.8%, primarily reflecting: a favorable pricing variance, predominantly driven by higher combustible tobacco pricing; and favorable volume/mix, driven by higher cigarette and HTU volume; a favorable comparison to 2023 reflecting a 2023 charge of $80 million following the termination of a distribution arrangement in the Middle East, a 2023 charge related to the termination of a pledge agreement with the Foundation for a Smoke-Free World of $41 million and $32 million related to restructuring charges in 2023. These increases were partly offset by higher manufacturing costs (primarily due to higher cost of tobacco leaf), higher marketing, administration and research costs, and the Egypt sales tax charge of $45 million in 2024.
