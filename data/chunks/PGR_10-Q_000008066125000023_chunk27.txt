LOSS AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES
Activity in the loss and loss adjustment expense reserves is summarized as follows:
We experienced favorable reserve development of $
278
million and $
11
million during the first three months of 2025 and 2024, respectively, which is reflected as “incurred related to prior years
”
in the table above.
First Quarter 2025
•
The favorable prior year reserve development included approximately $
180
million attributable to accident year 2024, $
90
million to accident year 2023, and the remainder to accident years 2022 and prior.
•
Our perso
nal auto products incurred about $
260
million of favorable loss and loss adjustment expense (LAE) reserve development, with the agency and direct auto businesses each contributing about half. The favorable development was primarily due to lower than anticipated loss severity and frequency in Florida.
•
Our personal property products experienced about $
30
million of favorable development, primarily attributable to favorable development on 2024 catastrophe events.
First Quarter 2024
•
The favorable prior year reserve development included approximately $
50
million of favorable development attributable to accident year 2023 and $
15
million to accident year 2022; partially offset by unfavorable development attributable to accident years 2021 and prior.
•
Our personal auto products incurred about $
100
million of favorable loss and LAE reserve development, in part due to lower than anticipated frequency in Florida following tort reform that passed in the first quarter 2023, with about
60
% attributable to the agency auto business and the balance in the direct auto business.
•
Our Commercial Lines business experienced about $
70
million of unfavorable development, primarily driven by higher than anticipated severity in our commercial auto business for California and New York.
