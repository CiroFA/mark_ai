Basis of Presentation
The accompanying unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements of The Procter & Gamble Company and subsidiaries ("the Company," "Procter & Gamble," "P&G," "we" or "our") should be read in conjunction with the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024. We have prepared these statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S. GAAP) pursuant to the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for interim financial information. Note that certain columns and rows may not add due to rounding. In the opinion of management, the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements contain all normal recurring adjustments necessary to present fairly the financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the interim periods reported. However, the results of operations included in such financial statements may not necessarily be indicative of annual results.

New Accounting Pronouncements and Policies
In November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2023-07, “Segment Reporting: Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures”. This guidance requires disclosure of incremental segment information on an annual and interim basis. This amendment is effective for our fiscal year ending June 30, 2025 and our interim periods within the fiscal year ending June 30, 2026. The guidance will require additional disclosures in the Segment Information footnote, but will not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.
In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, “Income Taxes: Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures”. This guidance requires consistent categories and greater disaggregation of information in the rate reconciliation and disclosures of income taxes paid by jurisdiction. This amendment is effective for our fiscal year ending June 30, 2026. We are currently assessing the impact of this guidance on our disclosures.
In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU No. 2024-03, “Income Statement—Reporting Comprehensive Income—Expense Disaggregation Disclosures: Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses”. This guidance requires disclosures about significant expense categories, including but not limited to, inventory purchases, employee compensation, depreciation, amortization and selling expenses.

Goodwill and Intangible Assets
Goodwill is allocated by reportable segment as follows:
Goodwill increased from June 30, 2024, primarily due to currency translation.
Amounts in millions of dollars except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.
8        The Procter & Gamble Company
Identifiable intangible assets at March 31, 2025, were comprised of:
Intangible assets with determinable lives consist of brands, patents, technology and customer relationships. The intangible assets with indefinite lives primarily consist of brands. The amortization expense of determinable-lived intangible assets for the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, was $
78
and $
83
, respectively. For the nine months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, amortization expense was $
241
and $
255
, respectively.
Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but are tested at least annually for impairment. We use the income method to estimate the fair value of these assets, which is based on forecasts of the expected future cash flows attributable to the respective assets. When appropriate, the market approach, which leverages comparable company revenue and earnings multiples, is weighted with the income approach to estimate fair value. If the resulting fair value is less than the asset's carrying value, that difference represents an impairment. Our annual impairment testing for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets occurs during the three months ended December 31. Other than our Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset, our goodwill reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets have fair values that significantly exceed their underlying carrying values.
As previously disclosed, the carrying value of the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset was impaired during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024. The impairment charge arose due to a higher discount rate, weakening of several currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and the impact of a new restructuring program focused primarily in certain Enterprise Markets, including Argentina and Nigeria. Following the impairment charge, the carrying value of the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset was equivalent to the estimated fair value as of December 31, 2023.
Based on our impairment testing performed during the three months ended December 31, 2024, the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset's fair value exceeds its carrying value by greater than
10
%. As of March 31, 2025, the carrying value of the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset was $
12.8
billion. Adverse changes in the business or in the macroeconomic environment, including foreign currency devaluation, increasing global inflation, or market contraction from an economic recession, could reduce the underlying cash flows used to estimate the fair value of the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset and trigger a further impairment charge.
The most significant assumptions utilized in the determination of the estimated fair value of the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset are the net sales growth rates (including residual growth rates), discount rate and royalty rates.
Net sales growth rates could be negatively impacted by reductions or changes in demand for our Gillette products, which may be caused by, among other things: changes in the use and frequency of grooming products, shifts in demand away from one or more of our higher priced products to lower priced products or potential supply chain constraints. In addition, relative global and country/regional macroeconomic factors could result in additional and prolonged devaluation of other countries' currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. The residual growth rates represent the expected rate at which the Gillette brand is expected to grow beyond the shorter-term business planning period. The residual growth rates utilized in our fair value estimates are consistent with the brand operating plans and approximate expected long-term category market growth rates. The residual growth rate depends on overall market growth rates, the competitive environment, inflation, relative currency exchange rates and business activities that impact market share. As a result, the residual growth rate could be adversely impacted by a sustained deceleration in category growth, grooming habit changes, devaluation of currencies against the U.S. dollar or an increased competitive environment.
The discount rate, which is consistent with a weighted average cost of capital that is likely to be expected by a market participant, is based upon industry required rates of return, including consideration of both debt and equity components of the capital structure. Our discount rate may be impacted by adverse changes in the macroeconomic environment, volatility in the equity and debt markets or other country specific factors, such as further devaluation of currencies against the U.S. dollar. Spot rates as of the fair value measurement date are utilized in our fair value estimates for cash flows outside the U.S.
The royalty rate used to determine the estimated fair value for the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset is driven by historical and estimated future profitability of the underlying Gillette business. The royalty rate may be impacted by significant adverse changes in long-term operating margins.
We performed a sensitivity analysis for the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset as part of our annual impairment testing during the three months ended December 31, 2024, utilizing reasonably possible changes in the assumptions for the discount rate, the short-term and residual growth rates and the royalty rate to demonstrate the potential impacts to estimated fair values.
The table below provides, in isolation, the estimated fair value impacts related to a 25 basis-point increase in the discount rate, a 25 basis-point decrease in our short-term and residual growth rates or a 50 basis-point decrease in our royalty rate.
Amounts in millions of dollars except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.
5.
Earnings Per Share
Basic net earnings per common share are calculated by dividing Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble less preferred dividends by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net earnings per common share are calculated by dividing Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble by the diluted weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. The diluted shares include the dilutive effect of stock options and other share-based awards based on the treasury stock method and the assumed conversion of preferred stock.
Net earnings per common share were calculated as follows:

Risk Management Activities and Fair Value Measurements
As a multinational company with diverse product offerings, we are exposed to market risks, such as changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates and commodity prices. There have been no significant changes in our risk management policies or activities during the nine months ended March 31, 2025.
The Company has not changed its valuation techniques used in measuring the fair value of any financial assets and liabilities during the period. The Company recognizes transfers between levels within the fair value hierarchy, if any, at the end of each quarter. There were no transfers between levels during the periods presented. Also, there was no significant activity within the Level 3 assets and liabilities during the periods presented. Except for the impairment of the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset discussed in Note 4, there were no significant assets or liabilities that were re-measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis during the nine months ended March 31, 2025 or during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024.
Cash equivalents were $
7.9
billion and $
8.0
billion as of March 31, 2025 and June 30, 2024, respectively, and are classified as Level 1 within the fair value hierarchy. The Company had no other material investments in debt or equity securities during the periods presented.
The fair value of long-term debt was $
27.9
billion and $
27.7
billion as of March 31, 2025 and June 30, 2024, respectively. This includes the current portion of long-term debt instruments ($
4.7
billion and $
3.8
billion as of March 31, 2025 and June 30, 2024, respectively). Certain long-term debt (debt designated as a fair value hedge) is recorded at fair value. All other long-term debt is recorded at amortized cost but is measured at fair value for disclosure purposes. We consider our debt to be Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. Fair values are generally estimated based on quoted market prices for identical or similar instruments.
Disclosures about Financial Instruments
The notional amounts and fair values of financial instruments used in hedging transactions as of March 31, 2025 and June 30, 2024, are as follows:
The fair value of the interest rate derivative asset/(liability) directly offsets the cumulative amount of the fair value hedging adjustment included in the carrying amount of the underlying debt obligation. The carrying amount of the underlying debt obligation, which includes the unamortized discount or premium and the fair value adjustment, was $
2.8
billion and $
2.7
billion as of March 31, 2025 and June 30, 2024, respectively. In addition to the foreign currency derivative contracts designated as net investment hedges, certain of our foreign currency denominated debt instruments are designated as net investment hedges. The carrying value of those debt instruments designated as net investment hedges, which includes the adjustment for the foreign currency transaction gain or loss on those instruments, was $
10.9
billion and $
11.9
billion as of March 31, 2025 and June 30, 2024, respectively. The increase in notional balance of the derivative instruments designated as net investment hedges is primarily driven by the Company's decision to leverage favorable interest rate spreads in the foreign currency swap market.
Derivative assets
are presented in Prepaid expenses and other current assets or Other noncurrent assets.
Derivative liabilities
are presented in Accrued and other liabilities or Other noncurrent liabilities. Changes in the fair value of net investment hedges are recognized in the Foreign currency translation component of Other comprehensive income (OCI). All of the Company's derivative assets and liabilities measured at fair value are classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy.
Certain of the Company's financial instruments used in hedging transactions are governed by industry standard netting and collateral agreements with counterparties. If the Company's credit rating were to fall below the levels stipulated in the agreements, the counterparties could demand either collateralization or termination of the arrangements. The aggregate fair value of the instruments covered by these contractual features that are in a liability position was $
269
and $
307
as of March 31, 2025 and June 30, 2024, respectively. The Company has not been required to post collateral as a result of these contractual features.
Amounts in millions of dollars except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.
The Procter & Gamble Company        11
Before tax gains and losses on our financial instruments in hedging relationships are categorized as follows:
(1)
For the derivatives in net investment hedging relationships, the amount of gain excluded from effectiveness testing, which was recognized in earnings, was $
60
and $
53
for the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively. The amount of gain excluded from effectiveness testing was $
167
and
$
182
for the nine months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively.
(2)
In addition to the foreign currency derivative contracts designated as net investment hedges, certain of our foreign currency denominated debt instruments are designated as net investment hedges. The amount of gain/(loss) recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) for such instruments was $(
436
) and $
262
for the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively. The amount of gain/(loss) recognized in AOCI for such instruments was
$(
221
) and $
102
for the
nine months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively.
The gains/(losses) on the derivatives in fair value hedging relationships are fully offset by the mark-to-market impact of the related exposure. These are both recognized in Interest expense. The gains/(losses) on derivatives not designated as hedging instruments are substantially offset by the currency mark-to-market of the related exposure. These are both recognized in Selling, general and administrative expense (SG&A).

Commitments and Contingencies
Litigation
We are subject, from time to time, to certain legal proceedings and claims arising out of our business, which cover a wide range of matters, including antitrust and trade regulation, product liability, advertising, contracts, environmental, patent and trademark
Amounts in millions of dollars except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.
12        The Procter & Gamble Company
matters, labor and employment matters and tax. While considerable uncertainty exists, in the opinion of management and our counsel, the ultimate resolution of the various lawsuits and claims will not materially affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
We are also subject to contingencies pursuant to environmental laws and regulations that in the future may require us to take action to correct the effects on the environment of prior manufacturing and waste disposal practices. Based on currently available information, we do not believe the ultimate resolution of environmental remediation will materially affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
Income Tax Uncertainties
The Company is present in about
70
countries and over
150
taxable jurisdictions and, at any point in time, has
30
–
40
jurisdictional audits underway at various stages of completion. We evaluate our tax positions and establish liabilities for uncertain tax positions that may be challenged by local authorities and may not be fully sustained, despite our belief that the underlying tax positions are fully supportable. Uncertain tax positions are reviewed on an ongoing basis and are adjusted in light of changing facts and circumstances, including progress of tax audits, developments in case law and closing of statutes of limitations. Such adjustments are reflected in the tax provision as appropriate. We have tax years open ranging from 2010 and forward. We are generally not able to reliably estimate the timing and ultimate settlement amounts until the close of an audit. Based on information currently available, we anticipate over the next 12-month period, audit activity could be completed related to uncertain tax positions in multiple jurisdictions for which we have accrued liabilities of approximately $
50
, including interest and penalties.
Additional information on the Commitments and Contingencies of the Company can be found in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024.
10.
Supplier Finance Programs
The Company has an ongoing program to negotiate extended payment terms with its suppliers consistent with market practices. The Company also supports a Supply Chain Finance program (“SCF”) with several global financial institutions. Under SCF, the Company maintains an accounts payable system to facilitate participating suppliers' ability to sell receivables from the Company to a SCF bank. These participating suppliers negotiate their sales of receivables arrangements directly with the respective SCF bank. The Company is not party to those agreements, but the SCF banks allow the suppliers to utilize the Company’s creditworthiness in establishing credit spreads and associated costs. Under this model, this arrangement generally provides the suppliers with more favorable terms than they would be able to secure on their own. The Company has no economic interest in a supplier’s decision to sell a receivable. Once a qualifying supplier chooses to participate in SCF, the supplier selects which individual Company invoices to sell to the SCF bank. The Company’s obligations to its suppliers, including the amounts due and scheduled payment dates, are not impacted by the supplier’s decisions to finance amounts under these arrangements. The Company does not provide any form of guarantee under these financing arrangements. Our payment terms for suppliers under this program generally range from
60
to
180
days. All outstanding amounts related to suppliers participating in SCF are recorded within Accounts payable in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, and the associated payments are included in operating activities within our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The amount due to suppliers participating in SCF and included in
Accounts payable
was approximately $
5.6
billion as of March 31, 2025 and June 30, 2024.
11.
Restructuring Program
The Company has historically incurred an ongoing annual level of restructuring-type activities to maintain a competitive cost structure, including manufacturing and workforce optimization. Before tax costs incurred under the ongoing program have generally ranged from $
250
to $
500
annually. Consistent with our historical policies for restructuring-type activities, the restructuring program charges will be funded by and included within Corporate for management and segment reporting.
In the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, the Company started a limited market portfolio restructuring of its business operations, primarily in certain Enterprise Markets, including Argentina and Nigeria, to address challenging macroeconomic and fiscal conditions. During the period ended September 30, 2024, the Company completed this limited market portfolio restructuring with the substantial liquidation of its operations in Argentina and recorded approximately $
0.8
billion after tax of incremental charges, comprised primarily of non-cash charges for accumulated foreign currency translation losses previously included in Accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss). The total incremental restructuring charges incurred under the program beginning in the three-month period ended December 31, 2023, through the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, were approximately $
1.2
billion after tax.
For the three months ended March 31, 2025, the Company incurred total before tax charges of $
55
including $
23
in Costs of products sold, $
26
in SG&A and $
6
in Other non-operating income/(expense). For the nine months ended March 31, 2025, the Company incurred charges of $
987
including $
91
in Costs of products sold, $
105
in SG&A and $
791
in Other non-operating income/(expense).
Amounts in millions of dollars except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.
The Procter & Gamble Company        13
The following table presents restructuring activity for the nine months ended March 31, 2025:
Separation Costs
Employee separation costs relate to severance packages that are primarily voluntary and the amounts calculated are based on salary levels and past service periods.
Asset-Related Costs
Asset-related costs consist of both asset write-downs and accelerated depreciation for manufacturing consolidations. Asset write-downs relate to the establishment of a new fair value basis for assets held-for-sale or for disposal. These assets are written down to the lower of their current carrying basis or amounts expected to be realized upon disposal, less minor disposal costs. Charges for accelerated depreciation relate to long-lived assets that will be taken out of service prior to the end of their normal service period.
Other Costs
Other restructuring-type charges are incurred as a direct result of the restructuring plan. Such charges include accumulated foreign currency translation losses, asset removal and termination of contracts.

Purpose, Approach and Non-GAAP Measures
The purpose of Management's Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) is to provide an understanding of Procter & Gamble's financial condition, results of operations and cash flows by focusing on changes in certain key measures from year to year. The MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes.
The MD&A is organized in the following sections:
•
Overview
•
Summary of Results – Nine Months Ended March 31, 2025
•
Economic Conditions and Uncertainties
•
Results of Operations – Three and Nine Months Ended March 31, 2025
•
Segment Results – Three and Nine Months Ended March 31, 2025

•
Measures Not Defined by U.S. GAAP
Throughout the MD&A we refer to measures used by management to evaluate performance, including unit volume growth, net sales, net earnings, diluted net earnings per common share (diluted EPS) and operating cash flow. We also refer to a number of financial measures that are not defined under U.S. GAAP, consisting of organic sales growth, Core earnings per share (Core EPS), adjusted free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow productivity. The explanation at the end of the MD&A provides the definition of these non-GAAP measures, details on the use and the derivation of these measures, as well as reconciliations to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure.
Management also uses certain market share and market consumption estimates to evaluate performance relative to competition despite some limitations on the availability and comparability of share and consumption information. References to market share and consumption in the MD&A are based on a combination of vendor-purchased traditional brick-and-mortar and online data in key markets as well as internal estimates. All market share references represent the percentage of sales of our products in dollar terms on a constant currency basis relative to all product sales in the category. The Company measures quarter and fiscal year to date market share through the most recent period for which market share data is available, which typically reflects a lag time of one or two months as compared to the end of the reporting period. Management also uses unit volume growth to evaluate drivers of changes in net sales. Organic volume growth reflects year-over-year changes in unit volume excluding the impacts of acquisitions and divestitures and certain one-time items, if applicable, and is used to explain changes in organic sales. Certain columns and rows may not add due to rounding.
OVERVIEW
P&G is a global leader in the fast-moving consumer goods industry, focused on providing branded consumer packaged goods of superior quality and value to our consumers around the world. Our products are sold in about 180 countries and territories, primarily through mass merchandisers, e-commerce (including social commerce) channels, grocery stores, membership club stores, drug stores, department stores, distributors, wholesalers, specialty beauty stores (including airport duty-free stores), high-frequency stores, pharmacies, electronics stores and professional channels. We also sell direct to individual consumers. We have on-the-ground operations in about 70 countries.
Our market environment is highly competitive with global, regional and local competitors. In many of the markets and industry segments in which we sell our products, we compete against other branded products as well as retailers' private-label brands.
The Procter & Gamble Company        15
Additionally, many of the product segments in which we compete are differentiated by price tiers (referred to as super-premium, premium, mid-tier and value-tier products). We believe we are well positioned in the industry segments and markets in which we operate, often holding a leadership or significant market share position.
The table below lists our reportable segments, including the product categories and brand composition within each segment.
(1)
Effective July 1, 2024, the Beauty reportable business segment separated Skin and Personal Care into individual operating segments, Skin Care and Personal Care. This transition included separation of the management team, strategic decision-making, innovation plans, financial targets, budgets and management reporting.
Throughout the MD&A, we reference business results by region, which are comprised of North America, Europe, Greater China, Latin America, Asia Pacific and India, Middle East and Africa (IMEA).
The following table provides the percentage of net sales and net earnings by reportable business segment (excluding Corporate) for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2025:
RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
Limited Market Portfolio Restructuring
In the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, the Company started a limited market portfolio restructuring of its business operations, primarily in certain Enterprise Markets, including Argentina and Nigeria, to address challenging macroeconomic and fiscal conditions. During the period ended September 30, 2024, the Company completed this limited market portfolio restructuring with the substantial liquidation of its operations in Argentina and recorded incremental restructuring charges of approximately $0.8 billion after tax, comprised primarily of non-cash charges for accumulated foreign currency translation losses previously included in Accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss). The total incremental restructuring charges incurred under the program beginning in the three-month period ended December 31, 2023, through the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, were approximately $1.2 billion after tax.
Consistent with our historical policies for ongoing restructuring-type activities, resulting charges were funded by and included
16        The Procter & Gamble Company
within Corporate for segment reporting. Restructuring charges above the normal ongoing level of restructuring costs are reported as non-core charges. For more details on the restructuring program, refer to Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
SUMMARY OF RESULTS – Nine Months Ended March 31, 2025
The following are highlights of results for the nine months ended March 31, 2025, versus the nine months ended March 31, 2024:
•
Net sales were $63.4 billion, a decrease of $112 million versus the prior year period. Net sales increased low single digits in Health Care, and decreased low single digits in Baby, Feminine & Family Care and Beauty. Net sales in Grooming and Fabric & Home Care were unchanged. Organic sales, which exclude the impacts of acquisitions and divestitures and foreign exchange, increased 2%. Organic sales increased low single digits in Health Care, Grooming, Fabric & Home Care, Beauty and Baby, Feminine & Family Care.
•
Net earnings were $12.4 billion, an increase of $609 million, or 5%, versus the prior year period due to the non-cash impairment charge of $1.3 billion ($1.0 billion after tax) on the Gillette intangible asset in the prior year, partially offset by higher restructuring charges in the current year of $0.8 billion after tax related to the substantial liquidation of operations in certain Enterprise Markets, including Argentina.
•

ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND UNCERTAINTI
ES
Global Economic Conditions.
Our products are sold in numerous countries worldwide, with more than half our sales generated outside the United States. Our largest international markets are Greater China, the United Kingdom, Canada, Japan and Germany and collectively comprised approximately 20% of our net sales in fiscal 2024. As a result, we are exposed to global macroeconomic factors, geopolitical tensions and government policies. We are exposed to various risks due to economic, political and social instabilities, market volatility, natural disasters, debt and credit issues, currency controls, new or increased tariffs (including any such tariffs between the U.S. and China or the U.S. and Canada), foreign exchange and interest rate changes. These risks can negatively impact our net sales, net earnings and cash flows. For example, we are exposed to risks due to the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine. Our Russia business accounted for less than 2% of consolidated net sales and net earnings in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024 and less than 2% of net assets as of June 30, 2024.
Foreign Exchange.
We have significant exposure to exchange rate fluctuations, both due to translation and transaction exposures. Translation exposures arise from measuring income statements of foreign subsidiaries with functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Transaction exposures involve impacts from 1) input costs that are denominated in currencies other than the local reporting currency and 2) revaluation of working capital balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency. We have experienced significant foreign exchange impacts in the past due to the weakening of certain foreign currencies versus the U.S. dollar, which have negatively impacted net sales, net earnings and cash flows. In response to the devaluation of foreign currencies (including those deemed highly inflationary), any lags or inability (due to government restrictions) to implement price increases or the negative impacts of such actions on product consumption may lead to a decline in our net sales, net earnings and cash flows.
Commodities and Supply Chain.
Our costs are subject to fluctuations due to changes in commodity and input material prices, transportation costs, inflationary impacts and productivity efforts. We have significant exposures to certain commodities and input materials, in particular certain oil-derived materials like resins and paper-based materials like pulp. Volatility in the market price of commodities and input materials directly affects our costs. Disruptions in manufacturing, supply and distribution operations can lead to increased costs. Legal or regulatory requirements and sustainability initiatives may result in increased costs. We strive to implement, achieve and sustain cost improvement plans, including supply chain optimization and general overhead and workforce optimization. Increased pricing in response to certain inflationary or cost increases may also offset portions of the cost impacts; however, such price increases may negatively impact product consumption. If we are unable to manage cost impacts through pricing actions and consistent productivity improvements, it may negatively impact our net sales, net earnings and cash flows.
Government Policies.
We are exposed to changes in U.S. and foreign government legislative, regulatory or enforcement policies that can have a negative impact on net sales, net earnings and cash flows. These include tax policy changes (both U.S. and foreign), including those resulting from the current work being led by the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework focused on
The Procter & Gamble Company        17
"Addressing the Challenges of the Digitalization of the Economy”. Government controls such as currency exchanges, pricing and import authorizations as well as government policies related to environmental and climate change matters and changes to international trade agreements, including tariffs, can also impact our financial performance.
For additional information on risk factors that could impact our business results, please refer to Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of the Company's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS – Three Months Ended March 31, 2025
The following discussion provides a review of results for the three months ended March 31, 2025, versus the three months ended March 31, 2024.
Net Sales
Net sales for the quarter decreased 2% to $19.8 billion. The decrease in net sales was due to unfavorable foreign exchange of 2% and unit volume decline of 1%, partially offset by higher pricing of 1%. Mix had a neutral impact on net sales. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures and foreign exchange, organic sales increased 1% and organic volume was unchanged.
The following table summarizes key drivers of the change in net sales by reportable segment:
(1)
Net sales percentage changes are approximations based on quantitative formulas that are consistently applied.
(2)
Other includes the sales mix impact from acquisitions and divestitures and rounding impacts necessary to reconcile volume to net sales.
Operating Costs
Gross margin decreased 20 basis points to 51.0% of net sales for the quarter. The decrease in gross margin was due to:
•
120 basis points of decline from unfavorable product mix,
•
40 basis points of product and packaging investments,
18        The Procter & Gamble Company
•
30 basis points of higher commodity costs and
•
20 basis points of unfavorable foreign exchange impacts.
These impacts were partially offset by:
•
160 basis points of manufacturing productivity savings and
•
30 basis points of increase due to higher pricing.
Total SG&A spending decreased 6% to $5.5 billion versus the prior year period due to decreased marketing spending and overhead costs. SG&A as a percentage of net sales decreased 120 basis points to 27.9% due to decreases in marketing spending and overhead costs as a percentage of net sales. Marketing spending as a percentage of net sales decreased 30 basis points due to productivity savings. Overhead costs as a percentage of net sales decreased 70 basis points as wage inflation and foreign exchange headwinds were more than offset by productivity savings, which includes adjustments to expected variable compensation payouts. Other operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 20 basis points due to favorable foreign exchange impacts. Productivity-driven cost savings delivered 120 basis points of benefit to SG&A as a percentage of net sales.
Operating income increased $98 million, or 2%, to $4.6 billion and operating margin increased 90 basis points to 23.0% versus the prior year period primarily due to decreased marketing spending and overhead costs, partially offset by the decrease in gross margin, the components of which are described above.
Non-Operating Expenses and Income
Interest expense was $217 million for the quarter, a decrease of $16 million versus the prior year period. Interest income was $111 million for the quarter, an increase of $7 million versus the prior year period. Other non-operating income/(expense) was $210 million, which is a decrease of $50 million versus the prior year period due to gains from the sale of minor brands in the prior year.
Income Taxes
The effective income tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2025, was 18.6%, compared to 17.7% for the three months ended March 31, 2024. The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily driven by lower excess tax benefits of share-based compensation.
Net Earnings
Net earnings were unchanged at $3.8 billion versus the prior year period due primarily to the increase in operating income, partially offset by the decrease in other non-operating income and the increase in the effective tax rate. Foreign exchange had a negative impact of approximately $75 million on net earnings for the quarter, including both transactional and translational impacts from converting earnings from foreign subsidiaries to U.S. dollars. Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble were unchanged at $3.8 billion for the quarter. Diluted EPS increased 1% to $1.54 versus the prior year period.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS – Nine Months Ended March 31, 2025

•
30 basis points of higher commodity costs,
•
20 basis points of higher transportation services and other costs and
•
10 basis points of unfavorable foreign exchange impacts.
These impacts were partially offset by:
•
160 basis points of manufacturing productivity savings and
•
20 basis points of increase due to higher pricing.
Total SG&A spending decreased 1% to $16.8 billion versus the prior year period due to higher foreign exchange transactional charges in the prior year period and decreased overhead costs.

Negative impacts of a decrease in unit volume, lower pricing (driven by investments in North America and Europe), unfavorable foreign exchange and divestitures were partially offset by favorable geographic and product mix (due to a higher proportion of premium diapers, which have higher than category-average selling prices). The unit volume decline was across most regions led by IMEA (due to competitive activity), Asia Pacific (due to market contraction) and Latin America (due to the impact of divestitures). Organic sales decreased low single digits primarily driven by a double-digit decline in IMEA and a mid-single-digit decline in Europe. Global market share of the Baby Care category decreased 0.2 points.
•
Feminine Care net sales were unchanged. Positive impacts of favorable geographic mix were offset by negative impacts of a decrease in unit volume and unfavorable foreign exchange. The unit volume decrease was primarily driven by declines in Greater China (due to market contraction and competitive activity) and Latin America (due to share losses), partially offset by growth in North America (due to market growth). Organic sales increased low single digits driven by a mid-single-digit growth in North America, partially offset by a mid-single-digit decline in Greater China. Global market share of the Feminine Care category decreased 0.4 points.
•
Net sales in Family Care, which is predominantly a North America business, increased low single digits driven by an increase in unit volume (due to retail inventory build, partially offset by competitive activity), partially offset by lower pricing (due to merchandising investments). Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, organic sales increased mid-single digits. North America market share of the Family Care category decreased 0.1 points.
Net earnings decreased 3% to $3.1 billion due to a decrease in net sales and a 60 basis-point decline in net earnings margin. Net earnings margin decreased due to a decrease in gross margin, partially offset by a decrease in SG&A as a percentage of net sales. Gross margin decreased primarily due to higher commodity costs and unfavorable category mix, partially offset by productivity savings. SG&A as a percentage of net sales decreased due to higher foreign exchange transactional charges in the prior year period and a reduction in marketing spending.
Corporate
Corporate includes certain operating and non-operating activities not allocated to specific business segments. These include but are not limited to incidental businesses managed at the corporate level, gains and losses related to certain divested brands or businesses, impacts from various financing and investing activities, impacts related to employee benefits, asset impairments and restructuring activities including manufacturing and workforce optimization. Corporate also includes reconciling items to adjust the accounting policies used within the reportable segments to U.S. GAAP. The most notable ongoing reconciling item is income taxes, which adjusts the blended statutory rates that are reflected in the reportable segments to the overall Company effective tax rate.
For the three months ended March 31, 2025, Corporate net sales increased $70 million to $198 million due to an increase in net sales of incidental businesses managed at the corporate level. Corporate net earnings increased $132 million to $200 million for the quarter due primarily to adjustments to expected variable compensation payouts.
The Procter & Gamble Company        25
For the nine months ended March 31, 2025, Corporate net sales increased $122 million to $520 million due to an increase in net sales of incidental businesses managed at the corporate level. Corporate net earnings increased $783 million to a loss of $531 million due primarily to the non-cash impairment charge of $1.3 billion ($1.0 billion after tax) on the Gillette intangible asset in the prior year, partially offset by incremental restructuring charges in the current year, comprised primarily of accumulated foreign currency translation losses due to the substantial liquidation of operations in Argentina.
LIQUIDITY & CAPITAL RESOURCES
Operating Activities
Operating cash flow was $12.8 billion fiscal year to date, a decrease of $1.3 billion versus the prior year period. Net earnings, adjusted for non-cash items (depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation expense, deferred income taxes and loss on sale of assets), generated $15.9 billion of operating cash flow. Working capital and other impacts used $3.1 billion of cash in the period primarily driven by the payment of the transitional tax related to the U.S. Tax Act, a reduction in postretirement benefit and compensation accruals, a reduction in accrued marketing expense and a reduction in accounts payable. Days sales outstanding were flat. Days inventory on hand increased by four days driven by higher inventory for new product initiatives and increased safety stock levels.
Investing Activities
Investing activities used $2.8 billion of cash fiscal year to date primarily driven by capital expenditures.
Financing Activities
Financing activities used $10.4 billion of net cash fiscal year to date, mainly due to dividends to shareholders and treasury stock purchases, partially offset by the impact of stock options and other and a net debt increase.
As of March 31, 2025, our current liabilities exceeded current assets by $9.8 billion. We anticipate being able to support our short-term liquidity and operating needs largely through cash generated from operations. We have strong short- and long-term debt ratings that have enabled and should continue to enable us to refinance our debt as it becomes due at favorable rates in commercial paper and bond markets. In addition, we have agreements with a diverse group of financial institutions that, if needed, should provide sufficient funding to meet short-term financing requirements.
MEASURES NOT DEFINED BY U.S. GAAP
In accordance with the SEC's Regulation S-K Item 10(e), the following provides definitions of the non-GAAP measures and the reconciliation to the most closely related GAAP measure. We believe that these measures provide useful perspective on underlying business trends (i.e., trends excluding non-recurring or unusual items) and results and provide a supplemental measure of period-to-period results. The non-GAAP measures described below are used by management in making operating decisions, allocating financial resources and for business strategy purposes. These measures may be useful to investors, as they provide supplemental information about business performance and provide investors a view of our business results through the eyes of management. These measures are also used to evaluate senior management and are a factor in determining their at-risk compensation. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be considered by the user in place of the related GAAP measures but rather as supplemental information to our business results. These non-GAAP measures may not be the same as similar measures used by other companies due to possible differences in method and in the items or events being adjusted.
Organic sales growth.
Organic sales growth is a non-GAAP measure of sales growth excluding the impacts of acquisitions and divestitures and foreign exchange from year-over-year comparisons. We believe this measure provides investors with a supplemental understanding of underlying sales trends by providing sales growth on a consistent basis. This measure is used in assessing the achievement of management goals for at-risk compensation.

The following tables provide a numerical reconciliation of organic sales growth to reported net sales growth:
Adjusted free cash flow.
Adjusted free cash flow is defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures and excluding payments for the transitional tax resulting from the U.S. Tax Act. Adjusted free cash flow represents the cash that the Company is able to generate after taking into account planned maintenance and asset expansion. We view adjusted free cash flow as an important measure because it is one factor used in determining the amount of cash available for dividends, share repurchases, acquisitions and other discretionary investments.
The following table provides a numerical reconciliation of adjusted free cash flow ($ millions):
Adjusted free cash flow productivity.
Adjusted free cash flow productivity is defined as the ratio of adjusted free cash flow to net earnings excluding a non-cash charge for accumulated foreign currency translation losses due to the substantial liquidation of operations in Argentina. We view adjusted free cash flow productivity as a useful measure to help investors understand P&G’s ability to generate cash. Adjusted free cash flow productivity is used by management in making operating decisions, in allocating financial resources and for budget planning purposes. This measure is also used in assessing the achievement of management goals for at-risk compensation.
The following table provides a numerical reconciliation of adjusted free cash flow productivity ($ millions):
Core EPS.
Core EPS is a measure of the Company's diluted EPS excluding items that are not judged by management to be part of the Company's sustainable results or trends. Management views this non-GAAP measure as a useful supplemental measure of Company performance over time. This measure is also used in assessing the achievement of management goals for at-risk compensation. The Core earnings measures included in the following reconciliation tables refer to the equivalent GAAP measures adjusted as applicable for the following items:
•
Incremental restructuring:
The Company has historically had an ongoing level of restructuring activities of approximately $250 - $500 million before tax. In the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, the Company started a limited market portfolio restructuring of its business operations, primarily in certain Enterprise Markets, including Argentina and Nigeria, to address challenging macroeconomic and fiscal conditions. During the period ended September 30,
The Procter & Gamble Company        27
2024, the Company completed this limited market portfolio restructuring with the substantial liquidation of its operations in Argentina. The adjustment to Core earnings includes the restructuring charges that exceed the normal, recurring level of restructuring charges.
•
Intangible asset impairment:
In the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, the Company recognized a non-cash, after-tax impairment charge of $1.0 billion ($1.3 billion before tax) to adjust the carrying value of the Gillette intangible asset acquired as part of the Company's 2005 acquisition of The Gillette Company.
We do not view the above items to be part of our sustainable results, and their exclusion from core earnings measures provides a more comparable measure of year-on-year results. These items are also excluded when evaluating senior management in determining their at-risk compensation.
