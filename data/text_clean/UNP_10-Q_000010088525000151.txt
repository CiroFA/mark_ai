NOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Unaudited)
For purposes of this report, unless the context otherwise requires, all references herein to "Union Pacific", “Corporation”, “Company”, “UPC”, “we”, “us”, and “our” mean Union Pacific Corporation and its subsidiaries, including Union Pacific Railroad Company, which will be separately referred to herein as “UPRR” or the “Railroad”.
1.
Basis of Presentation
Our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements are unaudited and reflect all adjustments (consisting of normal and recurring adjustments) that are, in the opinion of management, necessary for their fair presentation in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). Pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), certain information and note disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been condensed or omitted. Accordingly, this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto contained in our 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our Consolidated Statement of Financial Position at December 31, 2024, is derived from audited financial statements. The results of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2025, are not necessarily indicative of the results for the entire year ending December 31, 2025.
The Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements are presented in accordance with GAAP as codified in the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC). Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period financial statement presentation.

The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, may be adopted on a prospective or retrospective basis, and early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the effect that the new guidance will have on our related disclosures.
In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03,
Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income - Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses,
which requires disclosure of additional information about specific expense categories in the notes to the financial statements. The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2027, may be adopted on a prospective or retrospective basis, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the effect that the new guidance will have on our related disclosures.

Operations and Segmentation
The Railroad, along with its subsidiaries and rail affiliates, is our
one
reportable operating segment. Although we provide and analyze revenues by commodity group, we treat the financial results of the Railroad as
one
segment due to the integrated nature of our rail network.
The Company’s Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM) is our Chief Executive Officer. The CODM assesses performance for our rail network and decides how to allocate resources based on net income as reported on our Consolidated Statements of Income. The measure of segment assets is reported on our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position as total assets.
Our operating revenues are primarily derived from contracts with customers for the transportation of freight from origin to destination.
Although our revenues are principally derived from customers domiciled in the U.S., the ultimate points of origination or destination for some products we transport are outside the U.S. Freight revenues from each of our commodity groups, as described in the table below, includes revenues from shipments to and from Mexico, which amounted to $
719
million and $
790
million for the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively.

Table of
Contents
Our significant segment expenses as monitored by the CODM are shown in the table below. This breakout of revenues and expenses is used by the CODM to monitor and assess the financial performance of our rail network by comparing actual results to prior years and plans.
[a]
Operating and Administrative includes compensation and benefits, purchased services and materials, equipment and other rents, non-locomotive fuel, and other expenses.
[b]
Other segment items includes car hire and leases, casualty costs, state and local taxes, subsidiary expense, and other overhead expense.
4.
Stock-Based Compensation
We have several stock-based compensation plans where employees receive nonvested stock options, nonvested retention shares, and nonvested stock units. We refer to the nonvested shares and stock units collectively as “retention awards”. Employees may also participate in our employee stock purchase plan (ESPP).
Information regarding stock-based compensation expense appears in the table below:
Stock options
– Stock options are granted at the closing price on the date of grant, have
10
-year contractual terms, and vest no later than
3
years from the date of grant.
None
of the stock options outstanding at March 31, 2025, is subject to performance or market-based vesting conditions.

Table of
Contents
The table below shows the annual weighted-average assumptions used for Black-Scholes valuation purposes:
The risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant; the expected dividend yield is calculated as the ratio of dividends paid per share of common stock to the stock price on the date of grant; the expected life is based on historical and expected exercise behavior; and expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of our stock price over the expected life of the stock option.
A summary of stock option activity during the three months ended March 31, 2025, is presented below:
At March 31, 2025, there was $
30
million of unrecognized compensation expense related to nonvested stock options, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of
1.3
years.
Additional information regarding stock option exercises appears in the following table:
Retention awards
– Retention awards are granted at no cost to the employee, vest over periods lasting up to
4
years, and have dividends and dividend equivalents paid to participants during the vesting periods.
Changes in our retention awards during the three months ended March 31, 2025, were as follows:
At March 31, 2025, there was $
108
million of total unrecognized compensation expense related to nonvested retention awards, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of
1.5
years

Performance stock unit awards
– In February 2025, our Board of Directors approved performance stock unit grants. This plan is based on performance targets for annual return on invested capital (ROIC) and operating income growth (OIG) compared to companies in the S&P 100 Industrials Index plus the Class I railroads. We define ROIC as net operating profit adjusted for interest expense (including interest on average operating lease liabilities) and taxes on interest divided by average invested capital adjusted for average operating lease liabilities.
The February 2025 stock units awarded to executives are subject to continued employment for
37
months, the attainment of certain levels of ROIC, and the relative
three-year
OIG. We expense two-thirds of the fair value of the units that are probable of being earned based on our forecasted ROIC over the
three-year
performance period, and with respect to the third year of the plan, we expense the remaining one-third of the fair value subject to the relative
three-year
OIG. We measure the fair value of performance stock units based upon the closing price of the underlying common stock as of the date of grant. Dividend equivalents are accumulated during the service period and paid to participants only after the units are earned.
Changes in our performance stock unit awards during the three months ended March 31, 2025, were as follows:
At March 31, 2025, there was $
29
million of total unrecognized compensation expense related to nonvested performance stock unit awards, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of
2.1
years. This expense is subject to achievement of the performance measures established for the performance stock unit grants.
5.
Retirement Plans
We provide defined benefit retirement income to eligible non-union employees through qualified and non-qualified (supplemental) pension plans. Qualified and non-qualified pension benefits are based on years of service and the highest compensation during the latest years of employment, with specific reductions made for early retirements. Non-union employees hired on or after January 1, 2018, are no longer eligible for pension benefits, but are eligible for an enhanced 401(k) plan.
Expense
Pension expense is determined based upon the annual service cost of benefits (the actuarial cost of benefits earned during a period) and the interest cost on those liabilities, less the expected return on plan assets. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is applied to a calculated value of plan assets that recognizes changes in fair value over a
5
-year period. This practice is intended to reduce year-to-year volatility in pension expense, but it can have the effect of delaying the recognition of differences between actual returns on assets and expected returns based on long-term rate of return assumptions. Differences in actual experience in relation to assumptions are not recognized in net income immediately but are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income/loss and, if necessary, amortized as pension expense.
The components of our net periodic pension benefit/cost were as follows:

Cash contributions
For the three months ended March 31, 2025, cash contributions totaled $
0
to the qualified pension plans. Any contributions made during 2025 will be based on cash generated from operations and financial market considerations. Our policy with respect to funding the qualified pension plans is to fund at least the minimum required by law and not more than the maximum amount deductible for tax purposes. At March 31, 2025, we do not have minimum cash funding requirements for 2025.

9.
Accounts Receivable
Accounts receivable include freight and other receivables reduced by an allowance for doubtful accounts. At both March 31, 2025, and December 31, 2024, our accounts receivable were reduced by $
6
million. Receivables not expected to be collected in one year and the associated allowances are classified as other assets in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. At March 31, 2025, and December 31, 2024, receivables classified as other assets were reduced by allowances of $
72
million and $
69
million, respectively.
Receivables securitization facility
– The Railroad maintains an $
800
million,
3
-year receivables securitization facility (the Receivables Facility) maturing in July 2025, with the intent to renew under comparable terms and conditions. Under the Receivables Facility, the Railroad sells most of its eligible third-party receivables to Union Pacific Receivables, Inc. (UPRI), a consolidated, wholly-owned, bankruptcy-remote subsidiary that may subsequently transfer, without recourse, an undivided interest in accounts receivable to investors. The investors have no recourse to the Railroad’s other assets except for customary warranty and indemnity claims. Creditors of the Railroad do not have recourse to the assets of UPRI.
The amount recorded under the Receivables Facility was $
0
at both March 31, 2025, and December 31, 2024. During the three months ended March 31, 2025, we issued $
0
and repaid $
0
under the Receivables Facility. The Receivables Facility was supported by $
1.7
billion and $
1.6
billion of accounts receivable as collateral at March 31, 2025, and December 31, 2024, which, as a retained interest, is included in accounts receivable, net in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.
The outstanding amount the Railroad maintains under the Receivables Facility may fluctuate based on current cash needs. The maximum allowed under the Receivables Facility is $
800
million with availability directly impacted by eligible receivables, business volumes, and credit risks, including receivables payment quality measures such as default and dilution ratios. If default or dilution ratios increase
one
percent, the allowable outstanding amount under the Receivables Facility would not materially change.

Table of
Contents
The costs of the Receivables Facility include interest, which will vary based on prevailing benchmark and commercial paper rates, program fees paid to participating banks, commercial paper issuance costs, and fees of participating banks for unused commitment availability. The costs of the Receivables Facility are included in interest expense and were $
1
million for both the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively.

For retirements of depreciable railroad properties that do not occur in the normal course of business, a gain or loss may be recognized if the retirement meets each of the following three conditions: (a) is unusual, (b) is material in amount, and (c) varies significantly from the retirement profile identified through our depreciation studies. In the second quarter of 2024, we sold a large portion of an intermodal equipment asset class resulting in a $
46
million gain recognized in other expense in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income.

Financial Instruments
Short-term investments
– All of the Company's short-term investments consist of time deposits and government agency securities. These investments are considered Level 2 investments and are valued at amortized cost, which approximates fair value. As of both March 31, 2025, and December 31, 2024, the Company had $
20
million of short-term investments, which is included in other current assets in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. All short-term investments have a maturity of less than one year and are classified as held-to-maturity.
Fair value of financial instruments
– The fair value of our short- and long-term debt was estimated using a market value price model, which utilizes applicable U.S. Treasury rates along with current market quotes on comparable debt securities. All of the inputs used to determine the fair market value of the Corporation’s long-term debt are Level 2 inputs and obtained from an independent source. At March 31, 2025, the fair value of total debt was $
27.4
billion, approximately $
5.4
billion less than the carrying value. At December 31, 2024, the fair value of total debt was $
25.3
billion, approximately $
5.9
billion less than the carrying value. The fair value of the Corporation’s debt is a measure of its current value under present market conditions. The fair value of our cash equivalents approximates their carrying value due to the short-term maturities of these instruments.
13.
Debt
Credit facilities
– At March 31, 2025, we had $
2.0
billion of credit available under our revolving credit facility (the Facility), which is designated for general corporate purposes and supports the issuance of commercial paper. Credit facility withdrawals totaled $
0
during the three months ended March 31, 2025. Commitment fees and interest rates payable under the Facility are similar to fees and rates available to comparably rated, investment-grade borrowers. The Facility allows for borrowings at floating rates based on Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR), plus a spread, depending upon credit ratings for our senior unsecured debt. The Facility, set to expire May 20, 2027, requires UPC to maintain an adjusted debt-to-EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) coverage ratio.
The definition of debt used for purposes of calculating the adjusted debt-to-EBITDA coverage ratio includes, among other things, certain credit arrangements, finance leases, guarantees, unfunded and vested pension benefits under Title IV of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), and unamortized debt discount and deferred debt issuance costs. At March 31, 2025 , the Company was in compliance with the adjusted debt-to-EBITDA coverage ratio, which allows us to carry up to $
46.7
billion of debt (as defined in the Facility), and we had $
34.6
billion of debt (as defined in the Facility) outstanding at that date. The Facility does not include any other financial restrictions, credit rating triggers (other than rating-dependent pricing), or any other provision that could require us to post collateral. The Facility also includes a $
150
million cross-default provision and a change-of-control provision.
During the three months ended March 31, 2025, we issued $
0
and repaid $
0
of commercial paper. At March 31, 2025, we had $
0
of commercial paper outstanding. Our revolving credit facility supports our outstanding commercial paper balances, and, unless we change the terms of our commercial paper program, our aggregate issuance of commercial paper will not exceed the amount of borrowings available under the Facility.
Shelf registration statement and significant new borrowings
– We filed an automatic shelf registration statement with the SEC that became effective on February 13, 2024. Under our shelf registration, we may issue, from time to time, any combination of debt securities, preferred stock, common stock, or warrants for debt securities or preferred stock in one or more offerings. The Board of Directors authorized the issuance of up to $
9.0
billion of debt securities.
14
Table of
Contents
During the three months ended March 31, 2025, we issued the following unsecured, fixed-rate debt securities under our shelf registration:
We used the net proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes, including the repurchase of common stock pursuant to our share repurchase programs. These debt securities include change-of-control provisions. At March 31, 2025, we had remaining authority from the Board of Directors to issue up to $
7.0
billion of debt securities under our shelf registration.
Receivables securitization facility
– As of both March 31, 2025, and December 31, 2024, we recorded $
0
of borrowings under our Receivables Facility as secured debt. (See further discussion in the "Receivables Securitization Facility" section of Note 9).

Commitments and Contingencies
Asserted and unasserted claims
– Various claims and lawsuits are pending against us and certain of our subsidiaries. We cannot fully determine the effect of all asserted and unasserted claims on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity. We have recorded a liability where asserted and unasserted claims are considered probable and where such claims can be reasonably estimated. We currently do not expect that any known lawsuits, claims, environmental costs, commitments, contingent liabilities, or guarantees will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity after taking into account liabilities and insurance recoveries previously recorded for these matters.
In December 2019, we received a putative class action complaint under the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act, alleging violation due to the use of a finger scan system developed and managed by third parties. While we believe that we have strong defenses to the claims made in the complaint and will vigorously defend ourselves, there is no assurance regarding the ultimate outcome. The outcome of this litigation is inherently uncertain, and we cannot reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss that may arise from this matter.
Personal injury
– The Federal Employers’ Liability Act (FELA) governs compensation for work-related accidents. Under FELA, damages are assessed based on a finding of fault through litigation or out-of-court settlements. We offer a comprehensive variety of services and rehabilitation programs for employees who are injured at work.
Because of the uncertainty surrounding the ultimate outcome of personal injury claims, it is reasonably possible that future costs to settle these claims may range from approximately $
365
million to $
480
million. We record an accrual at the low end of the range as no amount of loss within the range is more probable than any other. Estimates can vary over time due to evolving trends in litigation.
Our personal injury liability activity was as follows:
Environmental costs
– We are subject to federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations. We have identified
352
sites where we are or may be liable for remediation costs associated with alleged contamination or for violations of environmental requirements. This includes
31
sites that are the subject of actions taken by the U.S. government, including
19
that are currently on the Superfund National Priorities List. Certain federal legislation imposes joint and several liability for the remediation of identified sites; consequently, our ultimate environmental liability may include costs relating to activities of other parties, in addition to costs relating to our own activities at each site.
15
Table of
Contents
Our environmental liability activity was as follows:
The environmental liability includes future costs for remediation and restoration of sites, as well as ongoing monitoring costs, but excludes any anticipated recoveries from third parties. Cost estimates are based on information available for each site, financial viability of other potentially responsible parties, and existing technology, laws, and regulations. The ultimate liability for remediation is difficult to determine because of the number of potentially responsible parties, site-specific cost sharing arrangements with other potentially responsible parties, the degree of contamination by various wastes, the scarcity and quality of volumetric data related to many of the sites, and the speculative nature of remediation costs. Estimates of liability may vary over time due to changes in federal, state, and local laws governing environmental remediation. Current obligations are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity.
Indemnities
– Our maximum potential exposure under indemnification arrangements, including certain tax indemnifications, can range from a specified dollar amount to an unlimited amount, depending on the nature of the transactions and the agreements. Due to uncertainty as to whether claims will be made or how they will be resolved, we cannot reasonably determine the probability of an adverse claim or reasonably estimate any adverse liability or the total maximum exposure under these indemnification arrangements. We do not have any reason to believe that we will be required to make any material payments under these indemnity provisions.
15.
Share Repurchase Programs
Effective April 1, 2025, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to
100
million shares of our common stock by March 31, 2028. These repurchases may be made on the open market or through other transactions. Our management has sole discretion with respect to determining the timing and amount of these transactions.
Our previous authorization, which was effective April 1, 2022, through March 31, 2025, was approved by our Board of Directors for up to
100
million shares of common stock. As of March 31, 2025, we repurchased a total of
31.7
million shares of our common stock under the 2022 authorization.
The table below represents shares repurchased under repurchase programs in the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024:
[a]
In the period of the final settlement, the average price under the accelerated share repurchase programs is calculated based on the total program value less the value assigned to the initial delivery of shares. The average price of the initial settlement of the 2025 accelerated share repurchase programs was $
251.73
.
[b]
Includes
4,815,022
shares repurchased in February 2025 under accelerated share repurchase programs.
Management's assessments of market conditions and other pertinent factors guide the timing, manner, and volume of all repurchases. We expect to fund any share repurchases under this program through cash generated from operations, the sale or lease of various operating and non-operating properties, debt issuances, and cash on hand. Open market repurchases are recorded in treasury stock at cost, which includes any applicable commissions, fees, and excise taxes.
Subsequent event
– From April 1, 2025, through April 23, 2025, we repurchased
2.0
million shares at an aggregate cost of approximately $
434
million.
Accelerated share repurchase programs
– The Company has established accelerated share repurchase programs (ASRs) with financial institutions to repurchase shares of our common stock. These ASRs have been structured so that at the time of commencement, we pay a specified amount to the financial institutions and receive an initial delivery of shares. Additional shares may be received at the time of settlement. The final number of shares to be received is based on the volume weighted
16
Table of
Contents
average price of the Company's common stock during the ASR term, less a discount and subject to potential adjustments pursuant to the terms of such ASR.
On February 18, 2025, the Company received
4,815,022
shares of its common stock repurchased under ASRs for an aggregate of $
1.5
billion. When the shares were received, the exchange was accounted for as an equity transaction with $
1.2
billion of the aggregate amount allocated to treasury stock and the remaining $
0.3
billion allocated to paid-in-surplus. This delivery of shares represents the initial and likely minimum number of shares that we may receive under the ASRs initiated in 2025. The final settlement is expected to be completed prior to the end of the third quarter of 2025.
ASRs are accounted for as equity transactions, and at the time of receipt, shares are included in treasury stock at fair market value as of the corresponding initiation or settlement date. The Company reflects shares received as a repurchase of common stock in the weighted average common shares outstanding calculation for basic and diluted earnings per share.

Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
UNION PACIFIC CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Three months ended March 31, 2025, compared to
three
months ended March 31, 2024
For purposes of this report, unless the context otherwise requires, all references herein to "Union Pacific", “UPC”, “Corporation”, “Company”, “we”, “us”, and “our” shall mean Union Pacific Corporation and its subsidiaries, including Union Pacific Railroad Company, which we separately refer to as “UPRR” or the “Railroad”.
The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and applicable notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, Item 1, and other information included in this report. Our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements are unaudited and reflect all adjustments (consisting only of normal and recurring adjustments) that are, in the opinion of management, necessary for their fair presentation in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP).
The Railroad, along with its subsidiaries and rail affiliates, is our one reportable business segment. Although revenues are analyzed by commodity, we analyze the net financial results of the Railroad as one segment due to the integrated nature of the rail network.
Critical accounting estimates
The preparation of these financial statements requires estimation and judgment that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets, and liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. If these estimates differ materially from actual results, the impact on the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements may be material. Our critical accounting estimates are available in Item 7 of our 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K. During the first three months of 2025, there have not been any significant changes with respect to our critical accounting estimates.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Quarterly summary
The Company reported earnings of $2.70 per diluted share on net income of $1.6 billion and an operating ratio of 60.7% in the first quarter of 2025 compared to earnings of $2.69 per diluted share on net income of $1.6 billion and an operating ratio of 60.7% for the first quarter of 2024. Freight revenues increased 1% in the first quarter of 2025 compared to the same period in 2024 driven by a 7% volume increase and core pricing gains, largely offset by unfavorable business mix (for example, a relative increase in international intermodal shipments, which have a lower average revenue per car (ARC)), lower fuel surcharge revenues, and one less day due to leap year in 2024. Volume increases were primarily driven by international intermodal and coal, partially offset by weaker demand for automotive and decreased petroleum product shipments.
Second half of 2024's operating momentum continued as we ran a fluid network in the first quarter of 2025 while handling 7% more volume than last year, including elevated international intermodal business, which was 33% more than first quarter of 2024. Terminal dwell and freight car velocity are key indicators of that fluidity, both improving 6% compared to last year. We continue to utilize our resources effectively as locomotive productivity improved 1% and workforce productivity improved 9% year-over-year. Manifest service performance index and train length improved from the first quarter of 2024, while intermodal service performance index was essentially flat.
Operating expenses decreased slightly compared to the first quarter of 2024 due to productivity and lower fuel prices. These decreases were partially offset by volume-related costs, inflation, and higher depreciation. Operating income of $2.4 billion and operating ratio of 60.7% remained unchanged from last year, despite the business mix, fuel price impact, and having one less day in 2025.

Table of
Contents
We generate freight revenues by transporting products from our three commodity groups. Freight revenues vary with volumes (carloads) and ARC. Changes in price, traffic mix, and fuel surcharges drive ARC. Customer incentives, which are primarily provided for shipping to/from specific locations or based on cumulative volumes, are recorded as a reduction to operating revenues. Customer incentives that include variable consideration based on cumulative volumes are estimated using the expected value method, which is based on available historical, current, and forecasted volumes, and recognized as the related performance obligation is satisfied. We recognize freight revenues over time as shipments move from origin to destination. The allocation of revenues between reporting periods is based on the relative transit time in each reporting period with expenses recognized as incurred.
Other subsidiary revenues (primarily logistics and commuter rail operations) are generally recognized over time as shipments move from origin to destination. The allocation of revenues between reporting periods is based on the relative transit time in each reporting period with expenses recognized as incurred. Accessorial revenues are recognized at a point in time as performance obligations are satisfied.
Freight revenues increased 1% in the first quarter of 2025 compared to the same period in 2024 driven by a 7% increase in volumes and core pricing gains, largely offset by unfavorable business mix (for example, a relative increase in international intermodal shipments, which have a lower ARC), lower fuel surcharge revenues, and one less day due to leap year in 2024. Volume increases were primarily driven by international intermodal and coal, partially offset by weaker demand for automotive and decreased petroleum product shipments.
Each of our commodity groups includes revenues from fuel surcharges. Freight revenues from fuel surcharge programs decreased $100 million to $565 million in the first quarter of 2025 compared to $665 million in the same period of 2024 due to lower fuel prices and the lag impact on fuel prices (it can generally take up to two months for changing fuel prices to affect fuel surcharge recoveries), partially offset by higher volumes.
Other subsidiary revenues decreased in the first quarter of 2025 compared to 2024 primarily driven by the partial transfer of our commuter operations to Metra and a weaker demand for intermodal shipments at our subsidiary that brokers intermodal and transload logistics services. Accessorial revenues decreased in the first quarter of 2025 compared to 2024 driven by lower intermodal accessorial revenues as a result of our intermodal equipment sale and a one-time contract settlement recognized in the first quarter of 2024.

Table of
Contents
Bulk
– Bulk includes shipments of grain and grain products, fertilizer, food and refrigerated, and coal and renewables. Freight revenues from bulk shipments increased in the first quarter of 2025 compared to 2024 due to core pricing gains and a 2% volume increase, partially offset by business mix from increased coal shipments and lower fuel surcharge revenues. The volume increase was driven by higher demand for coal used in electricity generation, due to colder weather and higher natural gas prices, and strength in export grain and grain products from increased soybean crush production and strong ethanol demand.
Industrial
– Industrial includes shipments of industrial chemicals and plastics, metals and minerals, forest products, and energy and specialized markets. Freight revenues from industrial shipments decreased in the first quarter of 2025 compared to 2024 due to business mix from decreased soda ash and lumber shipments, lower fuel surcharge revenues, and volume declines, partially offset by core pricing gains. Volume decreases in first quarter of 2025 compared to 2024 were driven by decreased shipments of petroleum due to business losses, a weaker global soda ash market, and a soft housing market along with ongoing tariff uncertainties that drove declines in lumber. Partially offsetting some of the volume declines was strength in rock, industrial chemicals, and plastics.
Premium
– Premium includes shipments of finished automobiles, automotive parts, and merchandise in intermodal containers, both domestic and international. Premium freight revenues increased in the first quarter of 2025 compared to 2024 due to a 13% rise in volume and core pricing gains, partially offset by business mix and lower fuel surcharge revenues. The volume increase was primarily due to continued elevated U.S. West Coast imports in the first quarter of 2025, reflecting a 33% increase compared to the first quarter of 2024. In addition, business development efforts in domestic intermodal contributed to year-over-year volume growth. Automotive shipments decreased in the first quarter of 2025 compared to 2024 due to reduced production and tariff uncertainties, which offset some of the volume gains from intermodal shipments.
Mexico business
– Freight revenues from each of our commodity groups includes revenues from shipments to and from Mexico, which decreased 9% to $719 million in the first quarter of 2025 compared to 2024 driven by a 5% volume decline and a 4% decrease in ARC. Volume declines were driven by lower automotive shipments in both parts and finished vehicles.
Operating expenses decreased slightly in the first quarter of 2025 compared to 2024 driven by productivity and lower fuel prices. These decreases were partially offset by volume-related costs, inflation, and higher depreciation.
Compensation and benefits
– Compensation and benefits include wages, payroll taxes, health and welfare costs, pension costs, and incentive costs. For the first quarter of 2025, expense decreased 1% compared to 2024 due to lower employee levels, partially offset by wage inflation.
Purchased services and materials
– Expense for purchased services and materials includes the costs of services purchased from outside contractors and other service providers (including equipment maintenance and contract expense incurred by our subsidiaries for external transportation services); materials used to maintain the Railroad’s lines, structures, and equipment; costs of operating facilities jointly used by UPRR and other railroads; transportation and lodging for train crew employees; trucking and contracting costs for intermodal containers; leased automobile maintenance expense; and tools and supplies. Purchased services and materials increased 3% in the first quarter of 2025 compared to 2024, driven by inflation, volume-related costs (including an increase in our active locomotive fleet), and a 2024 favorable contract settlement, partially offset by decreased volume-related drayage costs incurred at one of our subsidiaries.
Depreciation
– The majority of depreciation relates to road property, including rail, ties, ballast, and other track material. Depreciation expense was up 3% for the first quarter of 2025 compared to 2024, driven by a higher depreciable asset base.
Fuel
– Fuel includes locomotive fuel and gasoline for highway and non-highway vehicles and heavy equipment. Fuel expense decreased in the first quarter of 2025 compared to the same period in 2024 driven by a decrease in locomotive diesel fuel prices and a 1% improvement in the fuel consumption rate (computed as gallons of fuel consumed divided by gross ton-miles
21

in thousands), partially offset by an increase in gross ton-miles. Locomotive diesel fuel prices averaged $2.51 and $2.81 per gallon (including taxes and transportation costs) in the first quarter of 2025 and 2024, respectively.
Equipment and other rents
– Equipment and other rents expense primarily includes rental expense that the Railroad pays for freight cars owned by other railroads or private companies; freight car, intermodal, and locomotive leases; and office and other rent expense, offset by equity income from certain equity method investments. Equipment and other rents expense increased 12% in the first quarter of 2025 compared to 2024, driven by increased car hire for auto racks, inflation, and increased demand in business (mainly intermodal) utilizing freight cars owned by others, partially offset by a reduction in equipment leases.
Other
– Other expense includes state and local taxes; freight, equipment, and property damage; utilities; insurance; personal injury; environmental remediation; employee travel; telephone and cellular; computer software; bad debt; and other general expenses. Other expense increased 1% in the first quarter of 2025 compared to 2024, driven by higher costs associated with destroyed equipment, partially offset by lower bad debt expense and environmental remediation costs.
Other income, net
– Other income decreased in the first quarter of 2025 compared to 2024. See Note 6 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, Item 1, for additional detail.
Interest expense
– Interest expense decreased in the first quarter of 2025 compared to 2024 due to a decreased weighted-average debt level of $31.9 billion in 2025 compared to $32.3 billion in 2024, partially offset by a slightly higher effective interest rate of 4.1% in 2025 compared to 4.0% in 2024.
Income tax expense
– Income tax expense was essentially flat in the first quarter of 2025 compared to 2024. Our effective tax rates for the first quarter 2025 and 2024 were 23.6% and 23.3%, respectively.
OTHER OPERATING/PERFORMANCE AND FINANCIAL STATISTICS
We report a number of key performance measures weekly to the Surface Transportation Board (STB). We provide these on our website at https://investor.unionpacific.com/key-performance-metrics.
Operating/performance statistics
Management continuously monitors these key operating metrics to evaluate our operational efficiency in striving to deliver the service product we sold to our customers.
22
Table of
Contents
Railroad performance measures are included in the table below:
[a]
As reported to the STB.
Gross and revenue ton-miles
– Gross ton-miles are calculated by multiplying the weight of loaded and empty freight cars by the number of miles hauled. Revenue ton-miles are calculated by multiplying the weight of freight by the number of rate miles. Both gross ton-miles and revenue ton-miles increased 3%, in the first quarter of 2025 compared to 2024, while carloadings increased 7% in the first quarter of 2025 compared to 2024. Changes in business mix drove the year-over-year variances between gross ton-miles, revenue ton-miles, and carloads due to increased international intermodal shipments that are generally lighter.
Freight car velocity
– Freight car velocity measures the average daily miles per car on our network. The two key drivers of this metric are the speed of the train between terminals (average train speed) and the time a rail car spends at the terminals (average terminal dwell time). Freight car velocity increased 6% in the first quarter of 2025 compared to 2024 driven by a 6% improvement in terminal dwell.
Locomotive productivity
– Locomotive productivity is gross ton-miles per average daily locomotive horsepower available. Locomotive productivity increased 1% in the first quarter of 2025 compared to 2024 driven by improved network fluidity and asset utilization despite the increase in active fleet to handle the additional volumes.
Train length
– Train length is the average maximum train length on a route measured in feet. Our train length increased 2% in the first quarter of 2025 compared to 2024 due to train length improvement initiatives and increases in international intermodal shipments.
Service performance index (SPI)
– SPI is a ratio of the service customers are currently receiving relative to the best monthly performance over the last three years. Measuring our performance relative to a historical benchmark demonstrates our focus on continuously improving service for our customers. Our SPI is calculated for intermodal and manifest products. Intermodal SPI was essentially flat in the first quarter of 2025 compared to 2024, while handling 18% more volume. Manifest SPI improved 6 points in the first quarter of 2025 compared to 2024 driven by improved network fluidity.
Workforce productivity
– Workforce productivity is average daily car miles per employee. Workforce productivity improved 9% in the first quarter of 2025 as average daily car miles increased 6% and employees decreased 3% compared to 2024. In the first quarter of 2025, we continued to adjust our active train, engine, and yard (TE&Y) workforce to enable responsiveness in an ever-changing demand and operating environment. As a result, we were able to handle 7% more volume with 1% fewer active TE&Y employees.
Operating ratio
– Operating ratio is our operating expenses reflected as a percentage of operating revenues. Our operating ratio of 60.7% for the first quarter of 2025 was consistent with 2024 driven by core pricing gains and productivity initiatives, offset by the year-over-year impact of the business mix, inflation, the year-over-year impact from lower fuel prices, and other costs.

The trailing twelve months income statement information ended March 31, 2025, is recalculated by taking the twelve months ended December 31, 2024, subtracting the three months ended March 31, 2024, and adding the three months ended March 31, 2025.

Represents the hypothetical interest expense we would incur (using the incremental borrowing rate) if the property under our operating leases were owned or accounted for as finance leases.
Adjusted debt (total debt plus operating lease liabilities plus after-tax unfunded pension and OPEB (other post-retirement benefit) obligations) to adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, and adjustments for other income and interest on present value of operating leases) is considered a non-GAAP financial measure by SEC Regulation G and Item 10 of SEC Regulation S-K and may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner. We believe this measure is important to management and investors in evaluating the Company’s ability to sustain given debt levels (including leases) with the cash generated from operations. In addition, a comparable measure is used by rating agencies when reviewing the Company’s credit rating. Adjusted debt to adjusted EBITDA should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, other information provided in accordance with GAAP. The most comparable GAAP measure is debt to net income ratio. The tables above provide reconciliations from net income to adjusted EBITDA, debt to adjusted debt, and debt to net income to adjusted debt to adjusted EBITDA. At both March 31, 2025, and December 31, 2024, the incremental borrowing rate on operating leases was 3.8%. Pension and OPEB were funded at March 31, 2025, and December 31, 2024.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
Financial condition

Table of
Contents
Operating activities
Cash provided by operating activities increased slightly in the first three months of 2025 compared to the same period of 2024.
Investing activities
Cash used in investing activities increased in the first three months of 2025 compared to the same period of 2024 driven by the timing of capital investments.
The table below details cash capital investments:
[a]
Other includes bridges and tunnels, signals, other road assets, and road work equipment.
[b]
Locomotives and freight cars include early lease buyouts of $127 million in 2025 and $96 million in 2024.
[c]
Weather-related damages for the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, are immaterial.
Capital plan
In 2025, we expect our capital plan to be approximately $3.4 billion, consistent with 2024. We plan to continue to make investments to support our growth strategy, improve the safety, resiliency, and operational efficiency of the network, harden our infrastructure, and replace older assets, including modernization of our locomotive fleet and acquiring freight cars to support replacement and growth opportunities. In addition, the plan includes investments in growth-related projects to drive more carloads to the network and enhance productivity. This includes siding construction and extension projects, terminal investments supporting our manifest network, and investments in certain ramps to efficiently handle volumes from new and existing intermodal customers. The capital plan may be revised if business conditions warrant or if laws or regulations affect our ability to generate sufficient returns on these investments.
Financing activities
Cash used in financing activities decreased in the first three months of 2025 compared to the same period of 2024 driven by an increase of debt issued and less debt repaid, partially offset by more share repurchases, including entering into accelerated share repurchase programs.
See Note 13 of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, Item 1, for a description of all our outstanding financing arrangements and significant new borrowings and Note 15 of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, Item 1, for a description of our share repurchase programs.
Free cash flow
– Free cash flow is defined as cash provided by operating activities less cash used in investing activities and dividends paid. Cash flow conversion rate is defined as cash provided by operating activities less cash used for capital investments as a ratio of net income.
Free cash flow and cash flow conversion rate are not considered financial measures under GAAP by SEC Regulation G and Item 10 of SEC Regulation S-K and may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner. We believe free cash flow and cash flow conversion rate are important to management and investors in evaluating our financial

performance and measures our ability to generate cash without external financing. Free cash flow and cash flow conversion rate should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, cash provided by operating activities.
The following table reconciles cash provided by operating activities (GAAP measure) to free cash flow (non-GAAP measure):
The following table reconciles cash provided by operating activities (GAAP measure) to cash flow conversion rate (non-GAAP measure):
Current liquidity status
We are continually evaluating our financial condition and liquidity. We analyze a wide range of economic scenarios and the impact on our ability to generate cash. These analyses inform our liquidity plans and activities outlined below and indicate we have sufficient borrowing capacity to sustain an extended period of lower volumes.
During the first quarter of 2025, we generated $2.2 billion of cash provided by operating activities, paid our quarterly dividend, and repurchased $1.4 billion worth of shares under our share repurchase programs, including entering into accelerated share repurchase programs for $1.5 billion ($1.2 billion assigned to the initial delivery of shares). On March 31, 2025, we had $1.4 billion of cash and cash equivalents, $2.0 billion of credit available under our revolving credit facility, and up to $800 million undrawn on the Receivables Facility. In January 2025, we redeemed all $350 million of outstanding 3.25% notes due January 15, 2025. In February 2025, we issued $2.0 billion of debt (see Note 13 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, Item 1). We have been, and we expect to continue to be, in compliance with our debt covenants.

As described in the notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and as referenced in the table below, we have contractual obligations that may affect our financial condition. Based on our assessment of the underlying provisions and circumstances of our contractual obligations, other than the risks that we and other similarly situated companies face with respect to the condition of the capital markets, as of the date of this filing, there is no known trend, demand, commitment, event, or uncertainty that is reasonably likely to occur that would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity. In addition, our commercial obligations, financings, and commitments are customary transactions that are like those of other comparable corporations, particularly within the transportation industry.
The following table identifies material contractual obligations as of March 31, 2025:
[a]
Excludes finance lease obligations of $124 million as well as unamortized discount and deferred issuance costs of ($1,707) million. Includes an interest component of $26,873 million.
[b]
Purchase obligations include locomotive maintenance contracts; purchase commitments for ties, ballast, and rail; and agreements to purchase other goods and services.
[c]
Includes leases for locomotives, freight cars, other equipment, and real estate. Includes an interest component of $114 million.
[d]
Includes estimated other post-retirement, medical, and life insurance payments and payments made under the unfunded pension plan for the next ten years.
[e]
Represents total obligations, including interest component of $12 million.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
There were no material changes to the Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk previously disclosed in our 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Item 4. Controls and Procedures
As of the end of the period covered by this report, the Corporation carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Corporation’s management, including the Corporation’s Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer (CFO), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Corporation’s disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION
Item 1. Legal Proceedings
From time to time, we are involved in legal proceedings, claims, and litigation that occur in connection with our business. We routinely assess our liabilities and contingencies in connection with these matters based upon the latest available information and, when necessary, we seek input from our third-party advisors when making these assessments. Consistent with SEC rules and requirements, we describe below material pending legal proceedings (other than ordinary routine litigation incidental to our business), material proceedings known to be contemplated by governmental authorities, other proceedings arising under federal, state, or local environmental laws and regulations (including governmental proceedings involving potential fines, penalties, or other monetary sanctions in excess of $1,000,000), and such other pending matters that we may determine to be appropriate. See also Note 14 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, Item 1.
Environmental matters
We receive notices from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and state environmental agencies alleging that we are or may be liable under federal or state environmental laws for remediation costs at various sites throughout the U.S., including sites on the Superfund National Priorities List or state superfund lists. We cannot predict the ultimate impact of these proceedings and suits because of the number of potentially responsible parties involved, the degree of contamination by various wastes, the scarcity and quality of volumetric data related to many of the sites, and the speculative nature of remediation costs.
Information concerning environmental claims and contingencies and estimated remediation costs is set forth in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Estimates - Environmental, Item 7, and Note 17 of the Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Item 8, of our 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Item 1A. Risk Factors
For a discussion of our potential risks and uncertainties, see the risk factors disclosed in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024. These risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations (including revenues and profitability), and/or stock price. Our business also could be affected by risks that we are not presently aware of or that we currently consider immaterial to our operations.
