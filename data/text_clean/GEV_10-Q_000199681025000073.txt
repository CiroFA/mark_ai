ORGANIZATION AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION
Organization.
On April 2, 2024, General Electric Company, which now operates as GE Aerospace (GE or Parent) completed the previously
announced spin-off (the Spin-Off) of GE Vernova Inc. (the Company, GE Vernova, our, we, or us). See Note 1 and Note 24 in the Notes to
our
audited consolidated and combined financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December
31,
2024 for further information
. Our common stock is listed under the symbol "GEV" on the New York Stock Exchange.
GE Vernova is a global leader in the electric power industry, with products and services that generate, transfer, orchestrate, convert, and
store electricity. We design, manufacture, deliver, and service technologies to create a more reliable and sustainable electric power system,
enabling electrification and decarbonization, underpinning the progress and prosperity of the communities we serve. We report our financial
results across
three
business segments:
•
Our Power segment includes design, manufacture, and servicing of gas, nuclear, hydro, and steam technologies, providing a
critical foundation of dispatchable, flexible, stable, and reliable power.
•
Our Wind segment includes our wind generation technologies, inclusive of onshore and offshore wind turbines and blades.
•
Our Electrification segment includes grid solutions, power conversion and storage, and electrification software technologies
required for the transmission, distribution, conversion, storage, and orchestration of electricity from point of
generation to point of
consumption. Effective January 1, 2025, our Power Conversion and Solar & Storage Solutions business units within our
Electrification segment were combined to form a new business unit, Power Conversion & Storage. Historical financial information
presented within this report conforms to the new business unit structure within the Electrification segment.
Basis of Presentation.
For periods prior to the Spin-Off, the
unaudited
combined financial statements have been derived from the
consolidated financial statements and accounting records of GE, including the historical cost basis of assets and liabilities comprising the
Company, as well as the historical revenues, direct costs, and allocations of indirect costs attributable to the operations of the Company,
using the historical accounting policies applied by GE. The unaudited combined financial statements do not purport to reflect what the
results of operations, comprehensive income, financial position, or cash flows would have been had the Company operated as a separate,
stand-alone entity during the periods prior to the Spin-Off
.
We have prepared the accompanying unaudited consolidated and combined financial statements pursuant to the rules and regulations of
the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) applicable to interim financial statements. Accordingly, certain information related to our
significant accounting policies and note disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) have been condensed or omitted. These unaudited consolidated and combined financial
statements reflect, in the opinion of management, all material adjustments (which include only normally recurring adjustments) necessary to
fairly state, in all material respects, our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows for the periods presented. These unaudited
consolidated and combined financial statements should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated and combined financial
statements, corresponding notes, and significant accounting policies in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2024. We have reclassified certain prior year amounts to conform to the current year’s presentation. The information
presented in tables throughout the notes is presented in millions of U.S. dollars unless otherwise stated. Certain columns and rows may not
add due to the use of rounded numbers. Percentages presented are calculated from the underlying numbers in millions.
All intercompany balance
s and transactions within the Company have been eliminated in the consolidated and combined financial
statements. Transactions between the Company and GE have been included in these consolidated and combined financial
statements
.
Certain financing transactions with GE are deemed to have been settled immediately through Net parent investment in the Consolidated
and Combined Statement of Financial Position and are accounted for as a financing activity in the Consolidated and
Combined Statement
of Cash Flows
as Transfers from (to) Parent.
Within th
e caption Increase (decrease) in accounts payable and equipment project payables
in our Consolidated and Combined Statement of Cash Flows, the increase (decrease)
in
due to related parties, which primarily included
transactions with GE, in the three months ended March 31, 2024, was
$(
365
) million
.
For periods prior to the Spin-Off, the Consolidated and Combined Statement of Financial Position reflects all of the assets and liabilities of
GE that are specifically identifiable as being directly attributable to the Company, including Net parent investment as a component of equity.
Net parent investment represents GE’s historical investment in the Company and includes accumulated net income and losses attributable
to the Company, and the net effect of transactions with GE and its
subsidiaries
.
NOTE

.
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Estimates and Assumptions
.
The preparation of the consolidated and combined financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP
requires management to make estimates based on assumptions about current, and for some estimates, future, economic and market
conditions which affect reported amounts and related disclosures in the consolidated and combined financial statements. We believe these
assumptions to be reasonable under the circumstances, and although our current estimates contemplate current and expected future
conditions, as applicable, it is reasonably possible that actual conditions could differ from our expectations, which could materially affect our
results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.
Estimates are used for, but are not limited to, determining revenues from contracts with customers, recoverability of inventory, long-lived
assets and investments, valuation of goodwill and intangible assets, useful lives used in depreciation and amortization, income taxes and
related valuation allowances, accruals for contingencies including legal, indemnifications, product warranties, and environmental, actuarial
assumptions used to determine costs of pension and postretirement benefits, valuation and recoverability of receivables, valuation of
derivatives, and valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as a result of acquisitions.
For further information on our significant accounting policies, please refer to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2024.

of customers’ installed base.
Contract and other deferred assets
increase
d
$
370
million

recognition ahead of billing milestones on equipment and other service agreements.
Contract liabilities and deferred income
increase
d
$
1,107
million
in the
three months ended
March 31, 2025

INCOME TAXES
.
The Company’s income tax provision through March 31, 2024 was prepared based on a separate return
basis. Following the Spin-off, the Company's income tax provision is prepared on a stand-alone basis.
We recorded income tax expense on pre-tax income with an effective tax rate of
20.5
%
for the
three months ended
March 31, 2025
. The
effective tax rate was lower than the U.S. statutory rate of
21%
primarily due to an income tax benefit from stock-based compensation,
mostly offset by losses providing no tax benefit in
certain
jurisdictions.
We recorded an income tax expense on a pre-tax loss in the
three months ended
March 31, 2024
due to taxes in profitable jurisdictions
and losses providing no tax benefit in other jurisdictions.
The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development has proposed a global minimum tax of
15%
of reported profits (Pillar Two)
and many countries have incorporated Pillar Two model rule concepts into their domestic laws. Although the model rules provide a
framework for applying the minimum tax, countries may enact Pillar Two slightly differently than the model rules and on different timelines
and may adjust domestic tax incentives in response to Pillar Two.
W
e incurred
insignificant
tax expenses in connection with Pillar Two in
the
three months ended
March 31, 2025
.
Based on our assessment of the realizability of our deferred tax assets as of
March 31, 2025
, we continue to maintain valuation
allowances against our deferred tax assets in the U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions, primarily due to cumulative losses in those
jurisdictions. Given the current year profit and anticipated future profitability in the U.S., it is reasonably possible that the continued
improvement in our U.S. operations could result in the positive evidence necessary to warrant the release of a significant portion of our U.S.
valuation allowance as early as the second half of 2025. A release of the valuation allowance would result in the recognition of certain U.S.
deferred tax assets and a corresponding benefit in our provision for income taxes in the period the release occurs.

274
million
shares of GE Vernova
common stock outstanding. The computation of basic and diluted earnings (loss) per common share for all periods t
hrough
April 1, 2024
was calculated using
274
million
common shares and is net of Net loss (income) attributable to noncontrolling interests. For periods prior to
the Spin-Off, there were no dilutive equity instruments as there were no equity awards of GE Vernova outstanding prior to the Spin-Off. The
dilutive effect of outstanding stock options, restricted stock units, and performance share units is reflected in the denominator for diluted
EPS using the treasury stock method.
(a) Diluted earnings (loss) per share excludes certain shares issuable under share-based compensation plans because the effect would
have been antidilutive.

associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices over the terms of our customer contracts. These
hedge contracts reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the impact of foreign currency exchange rate and commodity price movements. The
Company does not enter into or hold derivative instruments for speculative trading purposes.
We use foreign currency contracts to reduce the volatility of cash flows related to forecasted revenues, expenses, assets, and liabilities.
These contracts are generally
one
to
12
months
in duration but with maximum remaining maturities of up to
15
years
as of
March 31, 2025
.
Cash Flow Hedges.
The total amount in AOCI related to cash flow hedges was a net
$
54
million
gain and a net
$
33
million
gain as of
March 31, 2025
and
December 31, 2024
, respectively, of which a net
$
26
million
gain and a net
$
22
million
gain, respectively, related to our
share of AOCI recognized at our non-consolidated joint ventures. We expect to reclassify
$
38
million
of pre-tax net losses associated with
designated cash flow hedges to earnings in the next 12 months, contemporaneously with the earnings effects of the related forecasted
transactions. The Company reclassified net gains (losses) from AOCI into earnings of
$(
9
) million
and
$(
13
) million
for the
three months
ended
March 31, 2025
and
2024
,
respectively. As of
March 31, 2025
, the maximum length of time over which we are hedging forecasted
transactions was approximately
10
years
.

Net Investment Hedges.
We enter into foreign exchange forwards designated as the hedging instruments in net investment hedging
relationships in order to mitigate the foreign currency risk attributable to the translation of the Company’s net investment in certain non
USD
-functional subsidiaries and equity method investees. The total amount in AOCI related to net investment hedges was a net gain of
$
31
million
and
$
33
million
as of
March 31, 2025

and liabilities of
$
140
million
and
$
134
million
as of

COMMITMENTS, GU
ARA
NTEES, PRODUCT WARRANTIES, AND OTHER LOSS CONTINGENCIES
Commitments
.
We had total investment commitments of
$
7
million
and unfunded lending commitments of
$
95
million
at
March 31, 2025
.
The commitments primarily consist of obligations to make investments or provide funding by our Gas Power and Financial Services
businesses. See Note
19
for further information.
Guarantees
.
As of
March 31, 2025
, we were committed under the following guarantee arrangements:
Credit support.
We have provided
$
571
million
of credit support on behalf of certain customers or associated companies, predominantly
joint ventures and partnerships, using arrangements such as standby letters of credit and performance guarantees, and a line of credit to
support our consolidated subsidiaries. The liability for such credit support was
$
6
million
.
Indemnification agreements.
We have
$
952
million
of indemnification commitments, including
obligations arising from the Spin-Off, our
commercial contracts, and agreements governing the sale of business assets
, for which we recorded a liability of
$
569
million
.
The liability
is primarily associated with cash and deposits, of which
$
325
million
relates to cash transferred to the Company from GE as part of the
Spin-Off that is restricted in connection with certain legal matters related to legacy GE operations. The liability reflects the use of these
funds to settle any associated obligations and the return of any remaining cash to GE in a future reporting period once resolved. In addition,
the liability includes
$
149
million
of indemnifications in connection with agreements entered into with GE related to the Spin-Off, including
the Tax Matters Agreement.
Product Warranties
.
We provide for estimated product warranty expenses when we sell the related products. Because warranty estimates
are forecasts that are based on the best available information, mostly historical claims experience, claims costs may differ from amounts
provided.
The liability for product warranties was
$
1,405
million
and
$
1,370
million
as of
March 31, 2025
and
December 31, 2024
,
respectively.
Credit
Facilities
.
We have
$
6,000
million
of credit facilities consisting of (i) a
five
-year
unsecured revolving credit facility in an aggregate
committed amount of
$
3,000
million
and (ii) a standby letter of credit and bank guarantee facility in an aggregate committed amount of
$
3,000
million
. For further information, see Note 22 in the Notes to our consolidated and combined financial statements in our Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024.
Fees related to the unused portion of the facilities were insignificant in
the three months ended March 31, 2025.
Legal Matters
.
In the normal course of our business, we are involved from time to time in various arbitrations, class actions, commercial
litigation, investigations, and other legal, regulatory, or governmental actions, including the significant matters described below that could
have a material impact on our results of operations. In many proceedings, including the specific matters described below, it is inherently
difficult to determine whether any loss is probable or even reasonably possible or to estimate the size or range of the possible loss, and
accruals for legal matters are not recorded until a loss for a particular matter is considered probable and reasonably estimable. Given the
nature of legal matters and the complexities involved, it is often difficult to predict and determine a meaningful estimate of loss or range of
loss until we know, among other factors, the particular claims involved, the likelihood of success of our defenses to those claims, the
damages or other relief sought, how discovery or other procedural considerations will affect the outcome, the settlement posture of other
parties, and other factors that may have a material effect on the outcome. For these matters, unless otherwise specified, we do not believe
it is possible to provide a meaningful estimate of loss at this time. Moreover, it is not uncommon for legal matters to be resolved over many
years, during which time relevant developments and new information must be continuously evaluated.

Alstom Legacy Legal Matters.
In November 2015, we acquired the power and grid businesses of Alstom, which prior to the acquisition
was the subject of significant cases involving anti-competitive activities and improper payments. The estimated liability balance was
$
235
million
and
$
236
million
at
March 31, 2025
and
December 31, 2024
, respectively,
for legal and compliance matters related to the legacy
business practices that were the subject of cases in various jurisdictions. Allegations in these cases relate to claimed anti-competitive
conduct or improper payments in the pre-acquisition period as the source of legal violations or damages. Given the significant litigation and
compliance activity related to these matters and our ongoing efforts to resolve them, it is difficult to assess whether the disbursements will
ultimately be consistent with the estimated liability established. The estimation of this liability may not reflect the full range of uncertainties
and unpredictable outcomes inherent in litigation and investigations of this nature, and at this time we are unable to develop a meaningful
estimate of the range of reasonably possible additional losses beyond the amount of this estimated liability. Factors that can affect the
ultimate amount of losses associated with these and related matters include formulas for determining disgorgement, fines and/or penalties,
the duration and amount of legal and investigative resources applied, political and social influences within each jurisdiction, and tax
consequences of any settlements or previous deductions, among other considerations. Actual losses arising from claims in these and
related matters could exceed the amount
provided.
Environmental and Asset Retirement Obligations.
Our operations involve the use, disposal, and cleanup of substances regulated under
environmental protection laws and nuclear decommissioning regulations. We have obligations for ongoing and future environmental
remediation activities and may incur additional liabilities in connection with previously remediated sites. Additionally, like many other
industrial companies, we and our subsidiaries are defendants in various lawsuits related to alleged worker exposure to asbestos or other
hazardous materials. Liabilities for environmental remediation, nuclear decommissioning, and worker exposure claims exclude possible
insurance recoveries.
It is reasonably possible that our exposure will exceed amounts accrued. However, due to uncertainties about the status of laws,
regulations, technology, and information related to individual sites and lawsuits, such amounts are not reasonably estimable. Our reserves
related to environmental remediation and worker exposure claims recorded in All other liabilities were
$
139
million
and
$
138
million
as of
March 31, 2025
and
December 31, 2024
, respectively.
We record asset retirement obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets as a liability in the period in which the
obligation is incurred and its fair value can be reasonably estimated. These obligations primarily represent nuclear decommissioning, legal
obligations to return leased premises to their initial state, or dismantle and repair specific alterations for certain leased sites. The liability is
measured at the present value of the obligation when incurred and is adjusted in subsequent periods. Corresponding asset retirement costs
are capitalized as part of the carrying value of the related long-lived assets and depreciated over the asset’s useful life. Our asset
retirement obligations were
$
525
million
and
$
622
million
as of
March 31, 2025
a
nd December 31, 2024
, respectively, and are recorded in
All other current liabilities and All other liabilities in our Consolidated and Combined Statement of Financial Position. Of these amounts,
$
440
million
and
$
546
million
were related to nuclear decommissioning obligations. The
decrease
in the liability balance was primarily due
to a settlement of a nuclear decommissioning obligation during the
three months ended
March 31, 2025
.
NOTE

.
RESTRUCTURING CHARGES AND SEPARATION COSTS
Restructuring and Other Charges.
The Company has undertaken or committed to various restructuring initiatives, including workforce
reductions and the consolidation of manufacturing and service facilities. Restructuring and other charges primarily include employee-related
termination benefits associated with workforce reductions, facility exit costs, asset write-downs, and cease-use costs. We expect the
majority of costs to be incurred within
two years
of the commitment of a restructuring initiative.
This table is inclusive of all restructuring charges and the charges are shown below for the business where they originated. Separately, in
our reported segment results, major restructuring programs are excluded from measurement of segment operating performance for internal
and external purposes; those excluded amounts are reported in Restructuring and other charges. See Note
22
for further information.
(a) Includes
$
28
million
and
$
68
million
, for the
three months ended
March 31, 2025
and
2024
, respectively, primarily of non-cash
impairment, accelerated depreciation, and other charges not reflected in the liability table below.
Liabilities associated with restructuring activities were primarily related to workforce reductions, and were recorded in All other current
liabilities, All other liabilities, and Non-current compensation and ben
efits.

Total restructuring and other charges incurred for the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024 primarily
relate
to programs to simplify
the organizational structure of, reduce operating costs in, and to right-size the Wind business.
Separation Costs.
In connection with the Spin-Off, the Company recognized separation costs of
$
45
million
for the
three months ended
March 31, 2025
in our Consolidated and Combined Statement of Income (Loss). Separation costs include system implementations,
advisory fees, one-time stock option grant, and other one-time costs, which are primarily recorded in Selling, general, and administrative
costs.

SEGMENT INFO
RMATION
.
Operating segments include components of an enterprise about which separate financial
information is available that is evaluated regularly by the Company’s Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM) for the purpose of assessing
performance and allocating resources. The Company’s CODM is its Chief Exec
utive Officer (CEO). Our operating activities are managed
through
three
segments: Power, Wind, and Electrification. These segments have been identified based on the nature of the products and
services sold and how the Company manages its operations.
The performance of these segments is principally measured based on revenues and segment EBITDA. Segment EBITDA is determined
based on the performance measures used by our CEO to assess the performance of each business in a given period. In connection with
that assessment, the CEO may exclude matters, such as charges for impairments, significant higher-cost restructuring programs,
manufacturing footprint rationalization and other similar expenses, acquisition costs and other related charges, certain gains and losses
from acquisitions or
dispositions,
and certain other non-operational items.
Consistent accounting policies have been applied by all segments for all reporting periods. See Note
1
for a
description of our reportable
segments.
2025 1Q FORM 10-Q

three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively, related to our Financial Services business which, because of the nature of
its investments, is measured on an after-tax basis.
(b) Costs incurred in the Spin-Off and separation from GE, including system implementations, advisory fees, one-time stock option grant,
and other one-time costs.
(c) Excludes depreciation and amortization expense related to Restructuring and other charges. Includes amortization of basis differences
included in Equity method investment income (loss) which is part of Other income (expense) - net.
(d) Consists of interest and other financial charges, net of interest income, other than financial interest related to our normal business
operations primarily with customers.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS
.
The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction
with our consolidated and combined financial statements,
which are prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles (GAAP),
and corresponding notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The following discussion and
analysis provides information that management believes to be relevant to understanding the financial condition and results of operations of
the Company for the
three months ended
March 31, 2025
and
2024
. The below discussion should be read alongside Item 7.
"Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and our audited consolidated and combined
financial statements and corresponding notes in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024.
Unless
otherwise noted, tables are presented in
U
.S. dollars in millions, except for per-share amounts which are presented in U.S. dollars. Certain
columns and rows within tables may not add due to the use of rounded numbers. Percentages presented in this report are calculated from
the underlying numbers in millions.
Unless otherwise noted, statements related to changes in operating results relate to the corresponding
period in the prior year.
In the accompanying analysis of financial information, we sometimes use information derived from consolidated and combined financial
data but not presented in our financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Certain of these data are considered “non-GAAP
financial measures” under SEC rules. For the reasons we use these non-GAAP financial measures and the reconciliations to their most
directly comparable GAAP financial measures, see "
—
Non-GAAP Financial Measures."
Financial Presentation Under GE Ownership.
W
e completed our separation from General Electric Company (GE), which now operates
as GE Aerospace, on April 2, 2024 (the Spin-Off).
For further information, see Note 1 in the Notes to our audited consolidated and
combined financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
fiscal
year ended December 31, 2024.
Tariffs.
During April 2025, the United States and other countries imposed global tariffs. These tariffs and any future tariffs will result in
additional costs to us. The current total
estimated cost impact
from the global tariffs as outlined is approximately $300 million
to $400 million
in
2025
, after taking into consideration contractual protections and mitigating actions. The actual impact of the tariffs may be significantly
different than our current estimate. Our estimate is subject to several factors including the amount, duration, scope and nature of the tariffs,
countermeasures that countries take, mitigating or other actions we take, and contractual implications.
Power Conversion & Storage.
Effective January 1, 2025, our Power Conversion and Solar & Storage Solutions business units within our
Electrification segment were combined to form a new business unit, Power Conversion & Storage.
Historical financial information presented
within this report conforms to the new business unit structure within the Electrification
segment
.
TRENDS AND FACTORS IMPACTING OUR PERFORMANCE
.
We believe our performance and future success depends on a number of
factors that present significant opportunities for us but also pose risks and challenges, including those discussed below.
Our worldwide operations are affected by regional and global factors impacting energy demand, including industry trends like
decarbonization, an increasing demand for r
enewa
ble energy alternatives, and changes in broader economic and geopolitical conditions.
These trends, along with the growing focus on the digitization and sustainability of the electricity infrastructure, drive growth across each of
our business segments
. We believe that our industry-defining technologies and commitment to innovation position us well to capitalize on
these long-term trends:
•
Demand growth for electricity generation
– Significant investment, infrastructure, and supply diversity will be essential to help meet
forecasted energy demand growth arising from population and global economic growth.
•
Decarbonization
– The urgency to combat climate change is fueling technology advancements that improve the economic viability and
efficiency of renewable energy alternatives and facilitate the transition to a more sustainable power sector.
•
Evolving generation mix
– The power industry is shifting from coal generation to more electricity generated from zero- or low-carbon
energy sources, and an evolving balance of generation sources will be necessary to maintain a reliable, resilient and affordable
system.
•
Energy resilience & security
– Threats and challenges from extreme weather events, cyber-attacks, and geopolitical tensions have
increased focus on the strength and resilience of power generation and transmission and reinforced the need for a diversified mix of
energy sources.
•
Grid modernization and investment
– Increased demand and the integration of advanced
generation
and storage solutions drive the
need to update aging infrastructure with new grid integration and automation solutions.
•
Regulatory and policy changes
– Government policies and regulations, such as carbon pricing, renewable energy mandates, and
subsidies for renewable energy technologies, can significantly impact the power generation landscape. Staying ahead of regulatory
changes and adapting to new compliance requirements is crucial for maintaining a competitive advantage.
•
Financial and investment dynamics
– Access to capital and investment trends in the energy sector can influence the development and
deployment of new power generation projects. Understanding market dynamics and securing funding are key to progressing strategic
initiatives.

OTHER INFORMATION
Gross Profit and Gross Margin.
Gross profit was
$1.5 billion
and
$1.2 billion
for the
three months ended
March 31, 2025
and
2024
,
respectively. Gross margin was
18.3%
and
15.8%
for the
three months ended
March 31, 2025
and
2024
, respectively. The increase in
gross profit
for the quarter
was due to an increase at Power primarily at Gas Power and Steam Power from higher volume, favorable price,
and increased productivity partially offset by the impact of inflation; an increase at Electrification due to
higher volume, productivity, and
favorable price
primarily at Grid Solutions; partially offset by a decrease at Wind due to Offshore Wind termination of a supply agreement
and Onshore Wind services from increased costs to improve fleet performance partially offset by improvement in equipment pricing, market
selectivity and increases in units delivered at Onshore Wind.
Selling, General, and Administrative.
Selling, general, and administrative costs were
$1.2 billion
and
$1.2 billion
and comprised
14.8%
and
16.6%
of revenues for the
three months ended
March 31, 2025
and
2024
, respectively.
The decrease in costs for the quarter was
attributable to cost reduction initiatives and the sale of a portion of Steam Power nuclear activities to EDF, partially offset by labor inflation
and higher corporate costs.
Restructuring Charges and Separation Costs.
We continuously evaluate our cost structure and are implementing several restructuring
and process transformation actions considered necessary to simplify our organizational structure. In addition, in connection with the Spin-
Off, we incurred and will continue to incur certain one-time separation costs. See Note
21
in the Notes to the consolidated and combined
financial statements for further information.
Interest and Other Financial Income (Charges) – Net
.
Interest and other financial income (charges) – net was
$0.1 billion
in income and
less than
$0.1 billion
in charges for the
three months ended
March 31, 2025
and
2024
,
respectively.
The income in 2025 was primarily
driven by a higher average balance of invested funds during the
three months ended
March 31, 2025
. The primary components of net
interest and other financial income (charges) are fees on cash management activities, interest on borrowings, and interest earned on cash
balances and short-term investments.
Income Taxes.
We recorded income tax expense on pre-tax income with an effective tax rate of
20.5%
for the
three months ended
March
31, 2025
. The effective tax rate was lower than the U.S. statutory rate of
21%
primarily due to an income tax benefit from stock-based
compensation,
mostly offset by losses providing no tax benefit in certain jurisdictions.
*Non-GAAP Financial Measure
2025 1Q FORM 10-Q
26
We recorded an income tax expense on a pre-tax loss in the
three months ended
March 31, 2024
due to taxes in profitable jurisdictions
and losses providing no tax benefit in other jurisdictions.
We regularly assess the realizability of our deferred tax assets based on all available evidence both positive and negative. Based on our
assessment of the realizability of our deferred tax assets as of
March 31, 2025
, we continue to maintain valuation allowances against
our deferred tax assets in the U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions, primarily due to cumulative losses in those jurisdictions. Given the
current year profit and anticipated future profitability in the U.S., it is reasonably possible that the continued improvement in our U.S.
operations could result in the positive evidence necessary to warrant the release of a significant portion of our U.S. valuation allowance as
early as the second half of 2025. A release of the valuation allowance would result in the recognition of certain U.S. deferred tax assets and
a corresponding benefit in our provision for income taxes in the period the release occurs. See Note
14
in the Notes to the consolidated
and combined financial statements for further information.
CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY
.
Historically, we participated in cash pooling and other financing arrangements with GE to
manage liquidity and fund our operations. As a result of completing the Spin-Off, we no longer participate in these arrangements and our
Cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash are held and used solely for our own operations. Our capital structure, long-term commitments,
and sources of liquidity have changed significantly from our historical practices. As of
March 31, 2025
, our Cash, cash equivalents, and
restricted cash was
$8.1 billion
,
$0.3 billion
of which was restricted use cash.
In addition, we have access to a
$3.0 billion
committed
revolving
credit facility (Revolving Credit Facility). See “—Capital Resources and Liquidity—Debt” for further information. We believe our
unrestricted c
ash, cash equivalents
, future cash flows generated from operations, and committed credit facility will be responsive to the
needs of our current and planned operations for at least the next 12 months.
On April 8, 2025, the Board of Directors declared a $0.25 per share quarterly dividend on our outstanding common stock, payable
on May
16, 2025, to stockholders of record as of April 18, 2024.
On December 10, 2024, the Board of Directors
authorized up to $6 billion of
common stock repurchases.
In connection with this authorization, we repurchased 4 million shares for $1.2 billion during the three months
ended March 31, 2025.
Although we intend to fund priorities that profitably grow the company and return capital to
stockholders
through
dividends and share repurchases as part of our capital allocation strategy, we are not obligated to pay cash dividends or to repurchase a
specified or any number or dollar value of shares under our share repurchase program. The declaration of any future dividends is at the
discretion of our Board of Directors and will be based on our earnings, financial condition, cash requirements, prospects, and other factors.
The amount and timing of any future share repurchases under our share repurchase program will be based on the trading price and volume
of our shares of common stock and other market factors as well as our earnings, financial condition, cash requirements, prospects,
alternative uses for our cash, and other factors.
Consolidated and Combined Statement of Cash Flows.
The most significant source of cash flows from operations is customer-related
activities, the largest of which is collecting cash resulting from equipment or services sales. The most significant operating uses of cash are
to pay our suppliers, employees, tax authorities, and postretirement plans. We measure ourselves on a free cash flow* basis. We believe
that free cash flow* provides management and investors with an important measure of our ability to generate cash on a normalized basis.
Free cash flow* also provides insight into our ability to produce cash subsequent to fulfilling our capital obligations; however, free cash flow*
does not delineate funds available for discretionary uses as it does not deduct the payments required for certain investing and financing
activities.
We typically invest in property, plant, and equipment (
PP&E)
over multiple periods to support new product introductions and increases in
manufacturing capacity and to perform ongoing maintenance of our manufacturing operations. We believe that while PP&E expenditures
will fluctuate period to period, we will need to maintain a material level of net PP&E spend to maintain ongoing operations and growth of the
business.
Cash from (used for) operating activities
was
$1.2 billion
and
$(0.4) billion
for the
three months ended
March 31, 2025
and
2024
,
respectively.
Cash from (used for) operating activities increased by
$1.6 billion
in
2025
compared to
2024
,
primarily
driven by: an
increase
in current
receivables of $0.6 billion, primarily due to higher collections, including a decrease i
n past dues
, partially offset by higher billings; an
increase in accounts payable and equipment project payables of $0.4 billion, primarily due to the nonrecurrence of settlements of payables
with GE
prior to the Spin-Off in the first quarter of 2024
; higher net income (after adjusting for depreciation of PP&E, and amortization of
intangible assets) of $0.3 billion; an
increase
in inventories of $0.3 billion, due to higher liquidations in Power and lower purchases of
materials
in Wind; and an increase in contract liabilities and current deferred income of $0.2 billion, primarily due to higher down payments
on orders and slot reservation agreements at Power, partially offset by lower
collections on projects
at Onshore Wind
.
Cash from operating activities of
$1.2 billion
for
the three months ended
March 31, 2025
included a
$1.0 billion
inflow from changes in
working capital. The cash inflow from changes in working capital was
primarily driven by
: contract liabilities and current deferred income of
$1.1 billion, driven by down payments
on orders and slot reservation agreements at
Power, and
down payments and collections at
Electrification
, partially offset
by revenue recognition
at Wind; and
current
receivables of $0.9 billion, driven by collections outpacing billings
in Wind and Power and a decrease in past dues; partially offset by inventories of $(0.4) billion, primarily due to
volume
in Power and
Electrification to support fulfillment and deliveries expected in 2025; current contract assets of $(0.3) billion, driven by revenue recognition
exceeding billings, primarily in Power and Wind; and accounts payable and equipment project payables of $(0.3) billion, due to
disbursements outpacing purchases of materials, partially offset by a decrease in prepayments.
*Non-GAAP Financial Measure
2025 1Q FORM 10-Q
27
Cash used for operating activities of $0.4 billion for the
three months ended
March 31, 2024
included a
$0.5 billion outflow from changes in
working capita
l. The cash outflow from changes in working capital was primarily driven by: inventories of $(0.7) billion, primarily in Gas
Power at Power and Onshore Wind at Wind, to support fulfillment and deliveries expected in the second half of 2024; accounts payable and
equipment project payables of $(0.7) billion due to higher disbursements than volume across all businesses, and settlements of payables
with GE in preparation for the Spin-Off; and current contract assets of $(0.3) billion driven by revenue recognition exceeding billings,
primarily in our Offshore Wind business at Wind; partially offset by contract liabilities and current deferred income of $0.9 billion as a result
of down payments and collections on several large projects in Onshore Wind at Wind, Gas Power at Power and Grid Solutions at
Electrification; and current receivables of $0.3 billion, driven by benefits arising from the
IRA
related to advanced manufacturing credits of
$0.2 billion, and collections outpacing billings, primarily in Power.
Cash from (used for) investing activities
was
$(0.1) billion
and
$(0.3) billion
for the
three months ended
March 31, 2025
and
2024
,
respectively.
Cash used for investing activities decreased by
$0.2 billion
in
2025
compared to
2024
primarily
driven by: lower purchases of and
contributions to equity method investments of $0.1 billion, primarily in our Financial Services business; and higher sales of and distributions
from equity method investments of $0.1 billion, driven by the sale of an approximately
2%
equity interest in China XD Electric Co., Ltd. in
the first quarter of 2025. Cash used for additions to PP&E and internal-use software, which is a component of free cash flow*, was $0.2
billion for both the
three months ended
March 31, 2025
and
2024
.
Cash from (used for) financing activities
was
$(1.3) billion
and
$1.9 billion
for the
three months ended
March 31, 2025
and
2024
,
respectively. Cash used for financing activities increased by $3.2 billion in 2025 compared to 2024 primarily driven by:
the nonrecurrence of
transfers from parent of $2.0 billion; and cash settlements for share repurchases of
$1.1 billion
in the first quarter of 2025.
Material Cash Requirements.
In the normal course of business, we enter into contracts and commitments that oblige us to make
payments in the future. See Notes
6
and
20
in the Notes to the consolidated and combined financial statements for further information
regarding our obligations under lease and guarantee arrangements as well as our investment commitments. See Note
12
in the Notes to
the consolidated and combined financial statements for further information regarding material cash requirements related to our pension
obligations.
Debt.
We had less than
$0.1 billion
and
$0.1 billion
of total debt, excluding finance leases, as of
March 31, 2025
and
December 31, 2024
,
respectively. We have a
$3.0 billion
Revolving Credit Facility to fund near-term intra-quarter working capital needs as they arise. In addition,
we have a
$3.0 billion
committed trade finance facility (Trade Finance Facility, and together with the Revolving Credit Facility, the Credit
Facilities). The Trade Finance Facility has not been and is not expected to be
utilized
,
and
does not contribute to direct liquidity. We believe
that our financing arrangements, future cash from operations, and access to capital markets will provide adequate resources to fund our
future cash flow needs. For more information about the Credit Facilities, refer to our Current Report on Form 8-K, filed with the SEC on April
2, 2024, and see Note 20 in the Notes to the consolidated and combined financial statements.
Credit Ratings and Conditions.
We have access to the Revolving Credit Facility to fund operations, and we may rely on debt capital
markets in the future to further su
pport our liquidity needs.
The
cost and availability of any debt financing is influenced by our credit ratings
and market conditions.
Standard and Poor's Global Ratings (S&P
) and Fitch Ratings (Fitch) have issued credit ratings for the Company. On
March 12, 2025, Fitch affirmed GE Vernova Inc.'s l
ong-t
erm credit rating and revised its outlook to Positive from Stable. On April 9, 2025,
S&P issued an annual tear sheet with no change to GE Vernova Inc.'s long-term credit rating or outlook. Our credit ratings as of the date of
this filing are set forth in the following table.
We are disclosing our credit ratings to enhance understanding of our sources of liquidity and the effects of our ratings on our costs of funds
and access to credit. Our ratings may be subject to a revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization, and each
rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. See Item 1A. "Risk Factors
—
Risks Relating to Our Business and Our Industry
—
Risks Relating to Operations and Supply Chain" and Item 1A. "Risk Factors
—
Risks Relating to Financial, Accounting, and Tax Matters"
in
our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024,
for a description of some of the potential consequences of a
reduction in our credit ratings.
If we are unable to maintain investment grade ratings, we could face significant challenges in being awarded new contracts, substantially
increasing financing and hedging costs, and refinancing risks as well as substantially decreasing the availability of credit. As of
March 31,
2025
, we
estimated an
insignificant
liquidity impact of a ratings downgrade below investment grade.
Parent Co
mpany C
redit Support.
Prior t
o the Spin-Off, to support GE Vernova businesses in selling products and services globally, GE
often entered into contracts on behalf of GE Vernova or issued parent company guarantees or trade finance instruments supporting the
performance of its subsidiary legal entities transacting directly with customers, in addition to providing similar credit support for non-
customer related activities of GE Vernova (collectively, the GE credit support). In connection with the Spin-Off, we are working to seek
novation or assignment of GE credit support, the majority of which relates to parent company guarantees, associated with GE Vernova
legal entities from GE to GE Vernova. For GE credit support that remained outstanding at the Spin-Off, GE Vernova is obligated to use
reasonable best efforts to terminate or replace, and obtain a full release of GE’s obligations and liabilities under, all such credit support.
Beginning in April 2025, GE Vernova will pay a quarterly fee to GE based on amounts related to the GE credit support.
GE Vernova is
subject to other contractual restrictions and requirements while GE continues to be obligated under such credit support on behalf of GE
Vernova. In addition, while GE will remain obligated under the contract or instrument, GE Vernova will be obligated to indemnify GE for
credit support related payments that GE is required to make and possible related costs.
*Non-GAAP Financial Measure
2025 1Q FORM 10-Q
28
As of
March 31, 2025
, we estimated GE Vernova RPO and other obligations that relate to GE credit support to be approximately
$15 billion
,
an over
59%
reduction since the Spin-Off. We expect approximately
$9 billion
of the RPO related to GE credit support obligations to
contractually mature by December 31, 2029. The underlying obligations are predominantly customer contracts that GE Vernova performs in
the normal course of its business. We have no known instances historically where payments or performance from GE were required under
parent company guarantees relating to GE Vernova customer contracts.
RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
.
In November 2024, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued
ASU No. 2024-03,
Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses (DISE).
The new standard requires disclosure about specific types of
expenses included in the expense captions presented on the face of the income statement as well as disclosure about selling expenses.
The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2026 and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2027,
with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact that this guidance will have on the disclosures within our consolidated
and combined financial statements.
In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09,
Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures
. The
amendments require disclosure of specific categories in the rate reconciliation and provide additional information for reconciling items that
meet a quantitative threshold and further disaggregation of income taxes paid for individually significant jurisdictions. The ASU is effective
for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024.
We are currently evaluating the impact that this guidance will have on the disclosures
within our consolidated and combined financial statements.
The Company will adopt the new annual disclosures as required for the fiscal
year ended December 31, 2025
.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES
.
To prepare our consolidated and combined financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP,
management makes estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of our assets and liabilities, including our contingent
liabilities, as of the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of our revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.
Our actual results may differ from these estimates. We consider estimates to be critical (i) if we are required to make assumptions about
material matters that are uncertain at the time of estimation or (ii) if materially different estimates could have been made or it is reasonably
likely that the accounting estimate will change from period to period.
See
Item 7. "Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations
—
Critical Accounting Estimates" and Note 2 in the Notes to the audited consolidated and combined
financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024 for additional discussion of
accounting policies and critical accounting estimates.
NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
.
The non-GAAP financial measures presented in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q
are
supplemental measures of our performance and our liquidity that we believe help investors understand our financial condition and operating
results and assess our future prospects. We believe that presenting these non-GAAP financial measures, in addition to the corresponding
U.S. GAAP financial measures, are important supplemental measures that exclude non-cash or other items that may not be indicative of or
are unrelated to our core operating results and the overall health of our company. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures
provide investors greater transparency to the information used by management for its operational decision-making and allow investors to
see our results “through the eyes of management.” We further believe that providing this information assists our investors in understanding
our operating performance and the methodology used by management to evaluate and measure such performance. When read in
conjunction with our U.S. GAAP results, these non-GAAP financial measures provide a baseline for analyzing trends in our underlying
businesses and can be used by management as one basis for financial, operational, and planning decisions. Finally, these measures are
often used by analysts and other interested parties to evaluate companies in our industry.
Management recognizes that these non-GAAP financial measures have limitations, including that they may be calculated differently by
other companies or may be used under different circumstances or for different purposes, thereby affecting their comparability from
company to company. In order to compensate for these and the other limitations discussed below, management does not consider these
measures in isolation from or as alternatives to the comparable financial measures determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Readers
should review the reconciliations below
, and above with respect to free cash flow,
and should not rely on any single financial measure to
evaluate our business. The reasons we use these non-GAAP financial measures and the reconciliations to their most directly comparable
U.S. GAAP financial measures follow.
We believe the organic measures presented below provide management and investors with a more complete understanding of underlying
operating results and trends of established, ongoing operations by excluding the effect of acquisitions, dispositions and foreign currency,
which includes translational and transactional impacts, as these activities can obscure underlying trends.
2025 1Q FORM 10-Q

(a) Includes intersegment sales of
$126 million
and
$78 million
for the
three months ended
March 31, 2025
and
2024
, respectively. See
Note
22
in the Notes to the consolidated and combined financial statements for further information.
We believe that Adjusted EBITDA* and Adjusted EBITDA margin*, which are adjusted to exclude the effects of unique and/or non-cash
items that are not closely associated with ongoing operations, provide management and investors with meaningful measures of our
performance that increase the period-to-period comparability by highlighting the results from ongoing operations and the underlying
profitability factors. We believe Adjusted organic EBITDA* and Adjusted organic EBITDA margin* provide management and investors with,
when considered with Adjusted EBITDA* and Adjusted EBITDA margin*, a more complete understanding of underlying operating results
and trends of established, ongoing operations by further excluding the effect of acquisitions, dispositions, and foreign currency, which
includes translational and transactional impacts, as these activities can obscure underlying trends. We believe these measures provide
additional insight into how our businesses are performing on a normalized basis. However, Adjusted EBITDA*, Adjusted organic EBITDA*,
Adjusted EBITDA margin* and Adjusted organic EBITDA margin* should not be construed as inferring that our future results will be
unaffected by the items for which the measures adjust.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
.
We are exposed to market risk
primarily from fluctuations of foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and commodity prices. These exposures are managed and
mitigated with the use of financial instruments, including derivatives contracts. We apply policies to manage these risks, including
prohibitions on speculative activities. The effects of foreign currency fluctuations on earnings were less than $0.1 billion and $(0.1) billion for
the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively. For more information about foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, and
commodity risk see Item 7A. "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal
year ended December 31, 2024.
ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCE
DURE
S
.
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures.
Under the supervision and with the participation of the Company's management,
including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the Company evaluated its disclosure controls and procedures as defined
in Rules 13(a)-15(e) and 15(d)-15(e) under the Exchange Act.
Based on this evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of March 31,
2025
, and that the information
required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized,
and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated
to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure.
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
.
During the
quarter
ended March 31, 2025, the Company continued to exit from
various transition service agreements with GE Aerospace primarily related to h
uman resources
(including payroll and benefit plan
administration) and associated information technology systems. Consequently, responsibility for execution and related internal controls
transferred to the Company, including certain general information technology controls in connection with information technology
environment changes.
Other than those discussed in the preceding sentences, no change in the Company’s internal control over financial
reporting occurred during the three months ended March 31, 2025, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect,
the Company's internal control over financial reporting.

PART II
ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
.
We are reporting the following m
atter
in compliance with SEC requirements to disclose
administrative proceedings arising under laws that regulate the discharge of materials into the environment where a governmental authority
is a party and that involve potential monetary sanctions of $300,000 or greater. In March 2024, one of our Australian subsidiaries received
notice from the Australian Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water (DCCEEW) of its intention to issue
infringement notices imposing administrative fines on the subsidiary for importing equipment containing SF6 gas without an equipment
license, as required by local law related to synthetic greenhouse gas management and seek a court order to impose civil penalties for
delinquent reporting under such law. The applicable local law regulates the import to Australia of synthetic greenhouse gases in equipment,
including certain of our switchgear products, and our subsidiary had neglected to renew the import license required under the law. We
responded to DCCEEW, and following discussions with the agency, paid approximately $0.3 million in fines in connection with the
infringement notices during the three months ended June 30, 2024. Discussions with DCCEEW regarding a court-issued civil penalty order
are pending and we expect additional fines and related costs associated with such order may be more than $300,000. See Note
