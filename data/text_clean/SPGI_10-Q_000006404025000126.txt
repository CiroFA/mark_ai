Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of S&P Global Inc.
Results of Review of Interim Financial Statements
We have reviewed the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of S&P Global Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of March 31, 2025, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, and equity  for the three-month periods ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, the related consolidated statements of cash flows for the three-month periods ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated interim financial statements”). Based on our reviews, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the consolidated interim financial statements for them to be in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
We have previously audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheet of the Company as of December 31, 2024, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, equity and cash flows for the year then ended, and the related notes and schedule (not presented herein); and in our report dated February 11, 2025, we expressed an unqualified audit opinion on those consolidated financial statements. In our opinion, the information set forth in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2024, is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the consolidated balance sheet from which it has been derived.
Basis for Review Results
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC and the PCAOB. We conducted our review in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. A review of interim financial statements consists principally of applying analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB, the objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.

Nature of Operations and Basis of Presentation
S&P Global Inc. (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, “S&P Global,” the “Company,” “we,” “us” or “our”) is a provider of credit ratings, benchmarks, analytics and workflow solutions in the global capital, commodity and automotive markets.
Our operations consist of
five
reportable segments: S&P Global Market Intelligence (“Market Intelligence”), S&P Global Ratings (“Ratings”), S&P Global Commodity Insights (“Commodity Insights”), S&P Global Mobility (“Mobility”) and S&P Dow Jones Indices (“Indices”).
•
Market Intelligence is a global provider of multi-asset-class data and analytics integrated with purpose-built workflow solutions.
•
Ratings is an independent provider of credit ratings, research, and analytics, offering investors and other market participants information, ratings and benchmarks.
•
Commodity Insights is a leading independent provider of information and benchmark prices for the commodity and energy markets.
•
Mobility is a leading provider of solutions serving the full automotive value chain including vehicle manufacturers (Original Equipment Manufacturers or OEMs), automotive suppliers, mobility service providers, retailers, consumers, and finance and insurance companies.
•
Indices is a global index provider maintaining a wide variety of valuation and index benchmarks for investment advisors, wealth managers and institutional investors.
On April 29, 2025, we announced that our Board of Directors decided to pursue a full separation of our Mobility segment, creating a new publicly traded company. The transaction, which would be implemented through the spin-off of shares of the new company to S&P Global shareholders, is expected to be tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes for S&P Global shareholders and is expected to be completed over the upcoming
12
to
18
months, subject to the satisfaction of customary legal and regulatory requirements and approvals.
The accompanying unaudited financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and notes required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements. Therefore, the financial statements included herein should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes included in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024 (our “Form 10-K”). Certain prior-year amounts have been reclassified to conform with current presentation.
In the opinion of management, all normal recurring adjustments considered necessary for a fair statement of the results of the interim periods have been included. The operating results for the three months ended March 31, 2025 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the full year.
On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions, including those related to revenue recognition, business combinations, allowance for doubtful accounts, valuation of long-lived assets, goodwill and other intangible assets, pension plans, incentive compensation and stock-based compensation, income taxes, contingencies and redeemable noncontrolling interests.
Since the date of our Form 10-K, there have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates.
Restricted Cash
We had restricted cash of less than $1 million included in our consolidated balance sheets
as of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024.
Contract Assets
Contract assets include unbilled amounts from when the Company transfers service to a customer before a customer pays consideration or before payment is due. As of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, contract assets were $
75
million and $
69
million, respectively, and are included in accounts receivable in our consolidated balance sheets.
9
Unearned Revenue
We record unearned revenue when cash payments are received in advance of our performance. The increase in the unearned revenue balance at March 31, 2025 compared to December 31, 2024 is primarily driven by cash payments received in advance of satisfying our performance obligations, offset by $
1.5
billion of revenues recognized that were included in the unearned revenue balance at the beginning of the period.
Remaining Performance Obligations
Remaining performance obligations represent the transaction price of contracts for work that has not yet been performed. As of March 31, 2025, the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations was $
4.9
billion. We expect to recognize revenue on approximately
sixty
percent and
eighty-five
percent of the remaining performance obligations over the next
12
and
24
months, respectively, with the remainder recognized thereafter.
We do not disclose the value of unfulfilled performance obligations for (i) contracts with an original expected length of one year or less and (ii) contracts where revenue is a usage-based royalty promised in exchange for a license of intellectual property.
Costs to Obtain Contracts
We recognize an asset for the incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer if we expect the benefit of those costs to be longer than one year. We have determined that the costs associated with certain sales commission programs are incremental to the costs to obtain contracts with customers and therefore meet the criteria to be capitalized. Total capitalized costs to obtain contracts were $
296
million and $
291
million as of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively, and are included in prepaid and other current assets and other non-current assets on our consolidated balance sheets. The capitalized asset will be amortized over a period consistent with the transfer to the customer of the goods or services to which the asset relates, calculated based on the customer term and the average life of the products and services underlying the contracts which has been determined to be approximately
5
years. The expense is recorded within selling and general expenses.
We expense sales commissions when incurred if the benefit of those costs is one year or less. These costs are recorded within selling and general expenses.
Equity in Income on Unconsolidated Subsidiaries
The Company holds an investment in a
50
/
50
joint venture arrangement with shared control with CME Group that combines each company’s post-trade services into a joint venture, OSTTRA. The joint venture provides trade processing and risk mitigation operations and incorporates CME Group’s optimization businesses (Traiana, TriOptima, and Reset) and the Company’s MarkitSERV business. The combination is intended to increase operating efficiencies of both the company's business to more effectively service clients with enhanced platforms and services for OTC markets across interest rate, FX, equity, and credit asset classes. Our share of earnings or losses are recognized in Equity in income on unconsolidated subsidiaries in our consolidated statements of income.
On April 14, 2025, the Company and CME Group entered into an agreement to sell OSTTRA to investment funds managed by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. (“KKR”), a leading global investment firm. The terms of the deal for OSTTRA equaled total enterprise value at $
3.1
billion, subject to customary purchase price adjustments, which will be divided evenly between the Company and CME Group pursuant to the
50
/
50
joint venture. We currently anticipate the sale to result in a pre-tax gain of $
220
million ($
140
million after-tax) for the Company, including the impact of accumulated other comprehensive income related to our investment. The transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2025, subject to customary closing conditions and receipt of required regulatory approvals.
Other Expense (Income), net
The components of other expense (income), net for the three months ended March 31 are as follows:

2.
Acquisitions and Divestitures
On April 24, 2025, we entered into an agreement to acquire the Automatic Identification System (AIS) data services business of ORBCOMM Inc. The AIS business is a leading provider of satellite data services used to track and monitor vessels, enhancing maritime visibility and delivering critical insights that support business intelligence and decision-making for government and commercial clients worldwide. The AIS business is expected to be integrated within our Market Intelligence segment. We also expect to enter into a strategic alliance with ORBCOMM. Under this strategic alliance, the two organizations expect to develop a range of differentiated supply chain data and insight offerings and we will make an equity investment in ORBCOMM, underscoring our commitment to further investing in this sector while helping customers navigate the complex supply chain environment. The proposed acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions, including receipt of certain regulatory approvals and is expected to close during 2025. The proposed acquisition is not expected to be material to our consolidated financial statements.
Acquisitions
During the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, we did not complete any material acquisitions.
Divestitures
During the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, we did not complete any material dispositions.
3.
Income Taxes
The effective income tax rate was
21.7
% and
18.8
% for the three months ended March 31, 2025 and March 31, 2024, respectively. The higher rate for the three months ended March 31, 2025 was primarily due to change in mix of income by jurisdiction. The lower rate for the three months ended March 31, 2024 was primarily due to a combination of discrete adjustments.
At the end of each interim period, we estimate the annual effective tax rate and apply that rate to our ordinary quarterly earnings. The tax expense or benefit related to significant unusual or infrequently occurring items that will be separately reported or reported net of their related tax effect, and are individually computed, is recognized in the interim period in which those items occur. In addition, the effect of changes in enacted tax laws or rates or tax status is recognized in the interim period in which the change occurs.
The Company is subject to tax examinations in various jurisdictions. As of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, the total amount of federal, state and local, and foreign unrecognized tax benefits was $
341
million and $
325
million, respectively, exclusive of interest and penalties. We recognize accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in interest expense and operating-related expense, respectively. As of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, we had $
78
million and $
65
million, respectively, of accrued interest and penalties associated with unrecognized tax benefits. Based on the current status of income tax audits, we believe that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits may decrease by approximately $
16
million in the next twelve months as a result of the resolution of local tax examinations.
The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”) introduced an international tax framework under Pillar Two which includes a global minimum tax of 15%. This framework has been implemented by several jurisdictions, including jurisdictions in which we operate, with effect from January 1, 2024, and many other jurisdictions, including jurisdictions in which we operate, are in the process of implementing it. The effect of enacted Pillar Two taxes has been included in the results disclosed and did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. The Company continues to monitor jurisdictions that are expected to implement Pillar Two in the future, and it is in the process of evaluating the potential impact of the enactment of Pillar Two by such jurisdictions on its consolidated financial statements.

The fair value of our total debt borrowings was $
10.1
billion an
d $
10.0
billion as of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively, and was estimated based on quoted market prices.
We have the ability to borrow a total of $
2.0
billion through our commercial paper program, which is supported by our $
2.0
billion
five-year
credit agreement (our “credit facility”) that will terminate on December 17, 2029. As of March 31, 2025, and December 31, 2024,  we had
no
outstanding commercial paper.
Commitment fees for the unutilized commitments under the credit facility and applicable margins for borrowings thereunder are linked to the Company achieving
three
environmental sustainability performance indicators related to emissions, tested annually. For the three months ended March 31, 2025, we paid a commitment fee of
7
basis points. There will be no sustainability pricing adjustment to our commitment fees or our margins under the credit facility for the approximately year-long period beginning April 7, 2025 as a result of our emissions performance for the year ended December 31, 2024. The credit facility contains customary affirmative and negative covenants and customary events of default. The occurrence of an event of default could result in an acceleration of the obligations under the credit facility.
T
he only financial covenant required is that our indebtedness to cash flow ratio, as defined in our credit facility, was not greater than
4
to 1, and this covenant level
has never been exceeded.
5.
Derivative Instruments
Our exposure to market risk includes changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates. We have operations in foreign countries where the functional currency is primarily the local currency. For international operations that are determined to be extensions of the parent company, the U.S. dollar is the functional currency. We typically have naturally hedged positions in most countries from a local currency perspective with offsetting assets and liabilities. As of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, we have entered into foreign exchange forward contracts to mitigate or hedge the effect of adverse fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. As of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, we held cross currency swap contracts to hedge a portion of our net investment in foreign subsidiaries against volatility in foreign exchange rates. These contracts are recorded at fair value that is based on foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates in active markets; therefore, we classify these derivative contracts within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. We do not enter into any derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
Undesignated Derivative Instruments
During the three months ended March 31, 2025 and twelve months ended December 31, 2024, we entered into foreign exchange forward contracts in order to mitigate the change in fair value of specific assets and liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. These forward contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting. As of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, the aggregate notional value of these outstanding forward contracts was $
2.5
billion and $
2.3
billion, respectively. The changes in fair value of these forward contracts are recorded in prepaid and other assets or other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets with their corresponding change in fair value recognized in selling and general expenses in the consolidated statements of income. The amount recorded in prepaid and other current assets was $
60
million as of March 31, 2025. The amount recorded in other current liabilities was $
2
million and $
42
million as of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively. The amount recorded in selling and general expense related to these contracts was a net gain of $
49
million for the three months ended March 31, 2025 and a net loss of $
37
million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, respectively.
Net Investment Hedges
As of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, we held cross currency swaps to hedge a portion of our net investment in certain European subsidiaries against volatility in the Euro/U.S. dollar exchange rate.These swaps are designated and qualify as a hedge of a net investment in a foreign subsidiary and are scheduled to mature in 2029, 2030, 2032 and 2033. The notional value of our outstanding cross currency swaps designated as a net investment hedge was $
3.5
billion as of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024. The changes in the fair value of these swaps are recognized in foreign currency translation adjustments, a
13
component of other comprehensive income (loss), and reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss in our consolidated balance sheet. The gain or loss will be subsequently reclassified into net earnings when the hedged net investment is either sold, liquidated or substantially liquidated. We have elected to assess the effectiveness of our net investment hedges based on changes in spot exchange rates. Accordingly, amounts related to the cross currency swaps recognized directly in net income represent net periodic interest settlements and accruals, which are recognized in interest expense, net. We recognized net interest income of $
14
million and $
8
million for the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively.
Cash Flow Hedges
Foreign Exchange Forward Contracts
During the three months ended March 31, 2025 and the twelve months ended December 31, 2024, we entered into a series of foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge a portion of the Indian rupee, British pound, and Euro exposures through the first quarter of 2027 and the fourth quarter of 2026, respectively. These contracts are intended to offset the impact of movement of exchange rates on future revenue and operating costs and are scheduled to mature within
twenty-four months
. The changes in the fair value of these contracts are initially reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss in our consolidated balance sheet and are subsequently reclassified into revenue and selling and general expenses in the same period that the hedged transaction affects earnings.
As of March 31, 2025, we estimate that $
2
million of pre-tax gain related to foreign exchange forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges recorded in other comprehensive income is expected to be reclassified into earnings within the next twelve months.
As of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, the aggregate notional value of our outstanding foreign exchange forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges was $
565
million and $
539
million, respectively.
Interest Rate Swaps
During the three months ended March 31, 2024, we terminated our interest rate swap contracts with an aggregate notional value of $
813
million and received net proceeds of $
155
million upon termination. These contracts were designated as cash flow hedges and were scheduled to mature beginning in the first quarter of 2027. We performed a final effectiveness test upon the termination of each swap, and the effective portion of the gain of $
155
million was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss in our consolidated balance sheet. The gain will be recognized into interest expense, net over the term which related interest payments will be made when we enter into anticipated future debt refinancing.
The following table provides information on the location and fair value amounts of our cash flow hedges and net investment hedges as of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024:

The following table provides information on the location and amounts of pre-tax gains (losses) on our cash flow hedges and net investment hedges for the three months ended March 31:
The activity related to the change in unrealized gains (losses) in accumulated other comprehensive loss was as follows for the three months ended March 31:
6.
Employee Benefits
We maintain a number of active defined contribution retirement plans for our employees. The majority of our defined benefit plans are frozen. As a result, no new employees will be permitted to enter these plans and no additional benefits for current participants in the frozen plans will be accrued.
We also have supplemental benefit plans that provide senior management with supplemental retirement, disability and death benefits. Certain supplemental retirement benefits are based on final monthly earnings. In addition, we sponsor a voluntary 401(k) plan under which we may match employee contributions up to certain levels of compensation as well as profit-sharing plans under which we contribute a percentage of eligible employees’ compensation to the employees’ accounts.
15
We also provide certain medical, dental and life insurance benefits for active employees and eligible dependents. The medical and dental plans and supplemental life insurance plan are contributory, while the basic life insurance plan is noncontributory. We currently do not prefund any of these plans.
We recognize the funded status of our retirement and postretirement plans in the consolidated balance sheets, with a corresponding adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of taxes. The amounts in accumulated other comprehensive loss represent net unrecognized actuarial losses and unrecognized prior service costs. These amounts will be subsequently recognized as net periodic pension cost pursuant to our accounting policy for amortizing such amounts.
Net periodic benefit cost for our retirement and postretirement plans other than the service cost component are included in other expense (income), net in our consolidated statements of income.
The components of net periodic benefit cost for our retirement plans and postretirement plans for the three months ended March 31 are as follows:
Net periodic benefit cost related to our postretirement plans reflected in the table above was not material for the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024.
As discussed in our Form 10-K, we changed certain discount rate assumptions for our retirement and postretirement plans and our expected return on assets assumption for our retirement plans which became effective on January 1, 2025. The effect of the assumption changes on retirement and postretirement expense for the three months ended March 31, 2025 did not have a material impact to our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
In the first three months of 2025, we contributed $
3
million to our retirement plans and expect to make additional required contributions of approximately $
8
million to our retirement plans during the remainder of the year. We may elect to make additional non-required contributions depending on investment performance or any potential deterioration of our pension plan status in the remaining nine months of 2025.
7.
Stock-Based Compensation
We issue stock-based incentive awards to our eligible employees under the 2019 Employee Stock Incentive Plan and to our eligible non-employee members of the Board of Directors under a Director Deferred Stock Ownership Plan.
For the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, total stock-based compensation expense related to restricted stock and other stock-based awards was $
47
million and $
33
million, respectively. During the three months ended March 31, 2025, the Company granted
0.3
million shares of restricted stock and other stock-based awards, which had a weighted average grant date fair value of $
527.77
per share. Total unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested equity awards as of March 31, 2025 was $
307
million, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of
1.7
years.
8.
Equity
Dividends
On January 28, 2025, the Board of Directors approved an increase in the dividends for 2025 to a quarterly common stock dividend of $
0.96
per share.
Stock Repurchases
On June 22, 2022, the Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing the purchase of
30
million shares (the “2022 Repurchase Program”), which was approximately
9
% of the total shares of our outstanding common stock at that time.
16
Our purchased shares may be used for general corporate purposes, including the issuance of shares for stock compensation plans and to offset the dilutive effect of the exercise of employee stock options. As of March 31, 2025,
10.7
million shares remained available under the 2022 Repurchase Program. Our 2022 Repurchase Program has no expiration date and purchases under this program may be made from time to time on the open market and in private transactions, depending on market conditions.
We have entered into accelerated share repurchase (“ASR”) agreements with financial institutions to initiate share repurchases of our common stock. Under an ASR agreement, we pay a specified amount to the financial institution and receive an initial delivery of shares. This initial delivery of shares represents the minimum number of shares that we may receive under the agreement. Upon settlement of the ASR agreement, the financial institution typically delivers additional shares. The total number of shares ultimately delivered, and therefore the average price paid per share, is determined at the end of the applicable purchase period of each ASR agreement based on the volume weighted-average share price, less a discount. We account for our ASR agreements as
two
transactions: a stock purchase transaction and a forward stock purchase contract. The shares delivered under the ASR agreements resulted in a reduction of outstanding shares used to determine our weighted average common shares outstanding for purposes of calculating basic and diluted earnings per share. The repurchased shares are held in Treasury. The forward stock purchase contracts are classified as equity instruments.
Effective January 1, 2023, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 has mandated a 1% excise tax on share repurchases. Excise tax obligations that result from the Company's share repurchases are accounted for as a cost of the treasury stock transaction, and are included in other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. The amount recorded in other current liabilities was $
36
million and $
30
million as of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively.
The terms of each ASR agreement entered into during the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, structured as outlined above, are as follows:
1
The ASR agreement was structured as an uncapped ASR agreement in which we paid $
650
million and initially received shares valued at
80
% of the $
650
million at a price equal to the market price of the Company
’
s common stock on February 19, 2025. The Company received an initial delivery of
1.0
million shares from the ASR program. The final settlement of the transaction under the ASR is expected to be completed no later than the end of the second quarter of 2025. The ASR agreement was executed under our 2022 Repurchase Program.
2
The ASR agreement was structured as an uncapped ASR agreement in which we paid $
500
million and initially received shares valued at
85
% of the $
500
million at a price equal to the market price of the Company
’
s common stock on February 12, 2024 when the Company received an initial delivery of
1.0
million shares from the ASR program. We completed the ASR agreement on April 12, 2024 and received an additional
0.2
million shares. The ASR agreement was executed under our 2022 Repurchase Program.
During the three months ended March 31, 2025, we received
1.3
million shares, including
0.3
million shares received in February of 2025 related to our October 28, 2024 ASR agreement. During the three months ended March 31, 2025, we purchased a total of
1.0
million shares for $
650
million of cash. During the three months ended March 31, 2024, we received
1.2
million shares, including
0.2
million shares received in February of 2024 related to our November 13, 2023 ASR agreement. During the three months ended March 31, 2024, we purchased a total of
1.0
million shares for $
500
million of cash.
Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests
Our redeemable noncontrolling interests include an agreement with the minority partners that own
27
% of our S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC joint venture that contains redemption features whereby interests held by minority partners are redeemable either (i) at the option of the holder or (ii) upon the occurrence of an event that is not solely within our control. Specifically, under the terms of the operating agreement of S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC, CME Group and CME Group Index Services LLC (“CGIS”) has the right at any time to sell, and we are obligated to buy, at least
20
% of their share in S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC. In addition, in the event there is a change of control of the Company, for the
15
days following a change in control, CME Group and CGIS will have the right to put their interest to us at the then fair value of CME Group’s and CGIS’ minority interest.
If interests were to be redeemed under this agreement, we would generally be required to purchase the interest at fair value on
17
the date of redemption. This interest is presented on the consolidated balance sheets outside of equity under the caption “Redeemable noncontrolling interests” with an initial value based on fair value for the portion attributable to the net assets we acquired, and based on our historical cost for the portion attributable to our S&P Index business. We adjust the redeemable noncontrolling interest each reporting period to its estimated redemption value, but never less than its initial fair value, using both income and market valuation approaches. Our income and market valuation approaches incorporate Level 3 fair value measures for instances when observable inputs are not available. The more significant judgmental assumptions used to estimate the value of the S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC joint venture include an estimated discount rate, a range of assumptions that form the basis of the expected future net cash flows (e.g., the revenue growth rates and operating margins), and a company specific beta. The significant judgmental assumptions used that incorporate market data, including the relative weighting of market observable information and the comparability of that information in our valuation models, are forward-looking and could be affected by future economic and market conditions. Any adjustments to the redemption value will impact retained income.
Noncontrolling interests that do not contain such redemption features are presented in equity.
Changes to redeemable noncontrolling interests during the three months ended March 31, 2025 were as follows:
1
Includes foreign currency translation adjustments.
2
As of March 31, 2025, $
4,239
million relates to our redeemable noncontrolling interest in the Indices business.
Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss
The following table summarizes the changes in the components of accumulated other comprehensive loss for the three months ended March 31:
1
Includes an unrealized gain related to our cross currency swaps. See Note 5 –
Derivative Instruments
for additional detail of items recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss.
2
Reflects amortization of net actuarial losses and is net of a tax benefit of less than $
1
million for the three months ended March 31, 2025. See Note 6 —
Employee Benefits
for additional details of items reclassed from accumulated other comprehensive loss to net earnings.

9.
Earnings Per Share
Basic earnings per common share (“EPS”) is computed by dividing net income attributable to the common shareholders of the Company by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted EPS is computed in the same manner as basic EPS, except the number of shares is increased to include additional common shares that would have been outstanding if potential common shares with a dilutive effect had been issued. Potential common shares consist primarily of restricted performance shares and stock options calculated using the treasury stock method.
18
The calculation of basic and diluted EPS for the three months ended March 31 is as follows:
We have certain stock options and restricted performance shares that are potentially excluded from the computation of diluted EPS. The effect of the potential exercise of stock options is excluded when the average market price of our common stock is lower than the exercise price of the related option during the period or when a net loss exists because the effect would have been antidilutive. Additionally, restricted performance shares are excluded because the necessary vesting conditions had not been met or when a net loss exists.
For the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, there were
no
stock options excluded. Restricted performance shares outstanding of
0.7
million and
0.9
million
as of March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively, were excluded.
10.
Restructuring
We continuously evaluate our cost structure to identify cost savings associated with streamlining our management structure. Our 2025 and 2024 restructuring plans consisted of a company-wide workforce reduction of approximately
230
and
1,230
positions, respectively, and are further detailed below. The charges for each restructuring plan are classified as selling and general expenses within the consolidated statements of income and the reserves are included in other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.
In certain circumstances, reserves are no longer needed because employees previously identified for separation resigned from the Company and did not receive severance or were reassigned due to circumstances not foreseen when the original plans were initiated. In these cases, we reverse reserves through the consolidated statements of income during the period when it is determined they are no longer needed.
The initial restructuring charge recorded and the ending reserve balance as of March 31, 2025 by segment is as follows:
19
We recorded a pre-tax restructuring charge of $
33
million primarily related to employee severance charges for the 2025 restructuring plan during the three months ended March 31, 2025. The ending reserve balance for the 2024 restructuring plan was $
88
million as of December 31, 2024. For the three months ended March 31, 2025, we have reduced the reserve for the 2024 restructuring plan by $
33
million. The reductions primarily related to cash payments for employee severance charges.
11.
Segment and Related Information
We have
five
reportable segments: Market Intelligence, Ratings, Commodity Insights, Mobility and Indices.
Our Chief Executive Officer is our chief operating decision-maker (“CODM”) and evaluates performance of our segments and allocates resources (including employees, property, and financial or capital resources) based primarily on operating profit for each segment. Segment operating profit does not include Corporate Unallocated expense, equity in income on unconsolidated subsidiaries, other expense (income), net, or interest expense, net, as these are amounts that do not affect the operating results of our reportable segments.
Operating results for the three months ended March 31 is as follows:
20
1
Intersegment revenue primarily relates to a royalty charged to Market Intelligence for the rights to use and distribute content and data developed by Ratings.
2
The segment expense category for Market Intelligence, Ratings, Commodity Insights, Mobility and Indices for
2025
and
2024
primarily include an aggregation of compensation costs, technology costs and strategic investments. The CODM considers actual-to-actual and budget-to-actual variances when making decisions about allocating personnel and capital to the segments; however, the CODM does not receive the individual expense items underlying the overall segment expenses. Variance explanations include segment expenses including compensation costs, technology costs and strategic investments, but the CODM is otherwise not provided, and cannot easily calculate, lower-level expense information.
3
In 2025, other segment items for each reportable segment primarily include amortization of intangibles from acquisitions and certain items primarily including employee severance charges, Executive Leadership Team transition costs and acquisition and disposition-related costs. In 2024, other segment items for each reportable segment primarily include amortization of intangibles from acquisitions and certain items primarily including IHS Markit merger costs, employee severance charges and acquisition and disposition-related costs.
4
Corporate Unallocated expense includes costs for corporate functions, select initiatives, unoccupied office space and Kensho, included in selling and general expenses.
21
The following table presents our revenue disaggregated by revenue type for the three months ended March 31:
1
Intersegment eliminations primarily consists of a royalty charged to Market Intelligence for the rights to use and distribute content and data developed by Ratings.
22
Segment information as of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024 is as follows:

Commitments and Contingencies
Leases
We determine whether an arrangement meets the criteria for an operating lease or a finance lease at the inception of the arrangement. We have operating leases for office space and equipment. Our leases have remaining lease terms of
1
year to
12
years, some of which include options to extend the leases for up to
12
years, and some of which include options to terminate the leases early. We sublease certain real estate leases to third parties which mainly consist of operating leases for space within our offices.
Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet; we recognize lease expenses for these leases on a straight line-basis over the lease term in operating-related expenses and selling and general expenses.
Operating lease ROU assets and operating lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of future minimum lease payments over the lease term at commencement date. Our future minimum based payments used to determine our lease liabilities include minimum based rent payments and escalations. As most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our estimated incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments.
The following table provides information on the location and amounts of our leases on our consolidated balance sheets as of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024:
23
The components of lease expense for the three months ended March 31 are as follows:
Supplemental information related to leases for the three months ended March 31 are as follows:
Weighted-average remaining lease term and discount rate for our operating leases are as follows:
Maturities of lease liabilities for our operating leases are as follows:
As of March 31, 2025, the Company has certain lease agreements that have not yet commenced with total estimated future lease payments of $
86
million which have been excluded from the table above. These leases are expected to begin in the second quarter of 2025 and continue through the third quarter of 2038, with lease terms ranging from
6
years to
12
years.
24
Related Party Agreements
In June of 2012, we entered into a license agreement (the “License Agreement") with the holder of S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC noncontrolling interest, CME Group, replacing the 2005 license agreement between Indices and CME Group. Under the terms of the License Agreement, S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC receives a share of the profits from the trading and clearing of CME Group's equity index products. During the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC earned $
52
million and $
48
million of revenue under the terms of the License Agreement. The entire amount of this revenue is included in our consolidated statement of income and the portion related to the
27
% noncontrolling interest is removed in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests.
Legal and Regulatory Matters
In the normal course of business both in the United States and abroad, the Company and its subsidiaries are defendants in a number of legal proceedings and are often subjected to government and regulatory proceedings, investigations and inquiries.
A class action lawsuit was filed in Australia on August 7, 2020 against the Company and a subsidiary of the Company. A separate lawsuit was filed against the Company and a subsidiary of the Company in Australia on February 2, 2021 by
two
entities within the Basis Capital investment group. The lawsuits both relate to alleged investment losses in collateralized debt obligations rated by Ratings prior to the financial crisis.  We can provide no assurance that we will not be obligated to pay significant amounts in order to resolve these matters on terms deemed acceptable.
From time to time, the Company receives customer complaints.  The Company believes it has strong contractual protections in the terms and conditions included in its arrangements with customers.  Nonetheless, in the interest of managing customer relationships, the Company from time to time engages in dialogue with such customers in an effort to resolve such complaints, and if such complaints cannot be resolved through dialogue, may face litigation regarding such complaints.  The Company does not expect to incur material losses as a result of these matters.
Moreover, various government and self-regulatory agencies frequently make inquiries and conduct investigations into our compliance with applicable laws and regulations, including those related to our regulated products and services, antitrust matters and other matters, such as ESG. For example, as a nationally recognized statistical rating organization registered with the SEC under Section 15E of the Exchange Act, S&P Global Ratings is in ongoing communication with the staff of the SEC regarding compliance with its extensive obligations under the federal securities laws. Although S&P Global seeks to promptly address any compliance issues that it detects or that the staff of the SEC or another regulator raises, there can be no assurance that the SEC or another regulator will not seek remedies against S&P Global for one or more compliance deficiencies. Any of these proceedings, investigations or inquiries could ultimately result in adverse judgments, damages, fines, penalties or activity restrictions, which could adversely impact our consolidated financial condition, cash flows, business or competitive position.
In view of the uncertainty inherent in litigation and government and regulatory enforcement matters, we cannot predict the eventual outcome of such matters or the timing of their resolution, or in most cases reasonably estimate what the eventual judgments, damages, fines, penalties or impact of activity (if any) restrictions may be. As a result, we cannot provide assurance that such outcomes will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, cash flows, business or competitive position. As litigation or the process to resolve pending matters progresses, as the case may be, we will continue to review the latest information available and assess our ability to predict the outcome of such matters and the effects, if any, on our consolidated financial condition, cash flows, business or competitive position, which may require that we record liabilities in the consolidated financial statements in future periods.
13.
Recently Issued or Adopted Accounting Standards
In November of 2024, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued accounting guidance which requires that an entity disclose, in the notes to financial statements, additional information about specific expense categories. The amendments in this update are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2027. We are currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on the Company’s disclosures.
25
In December of 2023, the FASB issued accounting guidance that expands disclosures in an entity’s income tax rate reconciliation table and regarding cash taxes paid both in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted, and should be applied either prospectively or retrospectively. We are currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on the Company’s disclosures.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Unaudited)
The following Management’s Discussion and Analysis (“MD&A”) provides a narrative of the results of operations and financial condition of S&P Global Inc. (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, “S&P Global,” the “Company,” “we,” “us” or “our”) for the three months ended March 31, 2025. The MD&A should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements, accompanying notes and MD&A included in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024 (our “Form 10-K”), which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). The MD&A includes the following sections:

OVERVIEW
We are a provider of credit ratings, benchmarks, analytics and workflow solutions in the global capital, commodity and automotive
markets. The capital markets include asset managers, investment banks, commercial banks, insurance companies, exchanges, trading firms and issuers; the commodity markets include producers, consumers, traders and intermediaries within energy, chemicals, shipping, metals, carbon and agriculture; and the automotive markets include manufacturers, suppliers, dealerships, service shops and customers.
Our operations consist of five reportable segments: S&P Global Market Intelligence (“Market Intelligence”), S&P Global Ratings (“Ratings”), S&P Global Commodity Insights (“Commodity Insights”), S&P Global Mobility (“Mobility”) and S&P Dow Jones Indices (“Indices”).
•
Market Intelligence is a global provider of multi-asset-class data and analytics integrated with purpose-built workflow solutions.
•
Ratings is an independent provider of credit ratings, research, and analytics, offering investors and other market participants information, ratings and benchmarks.
•
Commodity Insights is a leading independent provider of information and benchmark prices for the commodity and energy markets.
•
Mobility is a leading provider of solutions serving the full automotive value chain including vehicle manufacturers (Original Equipment Manufacturers or OEMs), automotive suppliers, mobility service providers, retailers, consumers, and finance and insurance companies.
•
Indices is a global index provider maintaining a wide variety of valuation and index benchmarks for investment advisors, wealth managers and institutional investors.
On April 29, 2025, we announced that our Board of Directors decided to pursue a full separation of our Mobility segment, creating a new publicly traded company. The transaction, which would be implemented through the spin-off of shares of the new company to S&P Global shareholders, is expected to be tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes for S&P Global shareholders and is expected to be completed over the upcoming 12 to 18 months, subject to the satisfaction of customary legal and regulatory requirements and approvals.
Key results for the three months ended March 31 are as follows:

2025 includes employee severance charges of $33 million, Executive Leadership Team transition costs of $12 million, acquisition-related costs of $9 million, a lease impairment of $6 million and disposition-related costs of $1 million. 2024 includes IHS Markit merger costs of $36 million, employee severance charges of $35 million, acquisition-related costs of $5 million and recovery of lease-related costs of $1 million. 2025 and 2024 also include amortization of intangibles from acquisitions of $281 million and $278 million, respectively.
Revenue increased 8% driven by increases at all of our reportable segments. The increase at Ratings was driven by growth in both non-transaction revenue and transaction revenue. Non-transaction revenue increased primarily due to an increase in volume related to surveillance, commercial paper, and medium-term notes. Transaction revenue increased primarily due to structured finance revenue driven by increased collateralized loan obligations, bank loan ratings revenue due to higher M&A activity, and U.S. Public Finance revenue due to an increase in issuance volumes. The increase at Market Intelligence was primarily due to subscription revenue growth in Data, Analytics & Insights driven by the favorable impact of the acquisition of Visible Alpha in May of 2024, growth in RatingsXpress®, RatingsDirect® and Credit Analytics within Credit & Risk Solutions and growth for work flow solutions in Enterprise Solutions, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of the sale of Fincentric in August of 2024. The increase at Indices was primarily due to higher asset-linked fees revenue, higher exchange-traded derivative revenue and higher data subscription revenue. The increase at Commodity Insights was primarily due to continued demand for market data and market insights products driven by expanded product offerings to our existing customers under enterprise use contracts and an increase in conference revenue driven by increased attendance at CERAWeek in 2025. The increase at Mobility was primarily due to growth within the Dealer and Financial businesses driven by continued new business growth within the Dealer business and strong underwriting volumes and market share growth within the Financial business. Foreign exchange rates had an unfavorable impact of 1 percentage point.
Operating profit increased 14%. Excluding the impact of IHS Markit merger costs in 2024 of 11 percentage points, partially offset by Executive Leadership Team transition costs in 2025 of 4 percentage points, a lease impairment in 2025 of 2 percentage points and higher acquisition-related costs in 2025 of 1 percentage point, operating profit increased 10%. The increase was primarily due to revenue growth, partially offset by higher compensation costs driven by annual merit increases and additional headcount, and investments in strategic initiatives. Foreign exchange rates had an unfavorable impact of 1 percentage point.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS — COMPARING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2025 AND 2024
Consolidated Review
N/M – Represents a change equal to or in excess of 100% or not meaningful
Revenue
The following table provides consolidated revenue information for the three months ended March 31:
30
Revenue increased 8% as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2024. Subscription revenue increased in the three month period primarily due to growth in Data, Analytics & Insights driven by the favorable impact of the acquisition of Visible Alpha in May of 2024, growth in RatingsXpress®, RatingsDirect® and Credit Analytics within Credit & Risk Solutions and growth for work flow solutions in Enterprise Solutions, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of the sale of Fincentric in August of 2024 at Market Intelligence, continued demand for Commodity Insights market data and market insights products, new business growth within the Dealer business and strong underwriting volumes and market share growth within the Financial business at Mobility, and higher data subscription revenue at Indices. Non-subscription / transaction revenue increased primarily due to structured finance revenue driven by increased collateralized loan obligations, bank loan ratings revenue due to higher M&A activity, and U.S. Public Finance revenue due to an increase in issuance volumes at Ratings, and an increase in conference revenue at Commodity Insights. Non-transaction revenue increased primarily due to an increase in volume related to surveillance, commercial paper, and medium-term notes at Ratings. Asset linked fees increased at Indices primarily due to higher levels of assets under management for ETFs and mutual funds. The increase in sales-usage based royalties was driven by higher exchange-traded derivative revenue at Indices and the licensing of our proprietary market data to commodity exchanges at Commodity Insights. Recurring variable revenue at Market Intelligence increased due to increased volumes. See “Segment Review” below for further information.
The unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates reduced revenue by 1 percentage point. This impact refers to constant currency comparisons estimated by recalculating current year results of foreign operations using the average exchange rate from the prior year.
31
Total Expenses
The following tables provide an analysis by segment of our operating-related expenses and selling and general expenses for the
three months
ended March 31:

Intersegment eliminations primarily relate to a royalty charged to Market Intelligence for the rights to use and distribute content and data developed by Ratings.
Selling and General Expenses
Selling and general expenses increased 7%. Excluding the impact of IHS Markit merger costs in 2024 of 8 percentage points, partially offset by Executive Leadership Team transition costs in 2025 of 3 percentage points, a lease impairment in 2025 of 1 percentage point and higher acquisition-related costs in 2025 of 1 percentage point, selling and general expenses increased 10%. The increase was primarily driven by higher compensation costs driven by annual merit increases and additional headcount, and an increase in strategic initiatives, partially offset by lower outside services expenses.
Depreciation and Amortization
Depreciation and amortization increased 2% to $293 million primarily due to higher intangible asset amortization driven by the acquisition of Visible Alpha in May of 2024.
32
Operating Profit
We consider operating profit to be an important measure for evaluating our operating performance and we evaluate operating profit for each of the reportable business segments in which we operate.
We internally manage our operations by reference to operating profit with economic resources allocated primarily based on each segment's contribution to operating profit. Segment operating profit is defined as operating profit before Corporate Unallocated expense and Equity in Income on Unconsolidated Subsidiaries. Segment operating profit is not, however, a measure of financial performance under U.S. GAAP, and may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner.
The tables below reconcile segment operating profit to total operating profit for the three months ended March 31:
1
2025 includes employee severance charges of $14 million, acquisition-related costs of $7 million, Executive Leadership Team transition costs of $4 million and disposition-related costs of $1 million. 2024 includes employee severance charges of $31 million, IHS Markit merger costs of $11 million and acquisition-related costs of $3 million. 2025 and 2024 include amortization of intangibles from acquisitions of $148 million and $140 million, respectively.

Segment Operating Profit —
Segment operating profit increased 14% as compared to 2024. Excluding the impact of IHS merger costs in 2024 of 10 percentage points, partially offset by Executive Leadership Team transition costs in 2025 of 4 percentage points and a lease impairment in 2025 of 2 percentage points, segment operating profit increased 10%. The increase was primarily due to revenue growth, partially offset by higher compensation costs driven by annual merit increases and additional headcount, and investments in strategic initiatives. See “Segment Review” below for further information.
Corporate Unallocated Expense —
Corporate Unallocated expense includes costs for corporate functions, select initiatives, unoccupied office space and Kensho, included in selling and general expenses. Corporate Unallocated expense increased 16% compared to 2024. Excluding the impact of IHS merger costs in 2024 of 24 percentage points, partially offset by higher employee severance charges in 2025 of 11 percentage points, Executive Leadership Team transition costs in 2025 of 11 percentage points, a lease impairment in 2025 of 8 percentage points and recovery of lease-related costs in 2024 of 1 percentage point, Corporate Unallocated expense increased 7% primarily due to disposition-related income in 2024 and higher incentives in 2025.

Equity in Income on Unconsolidated Subsidiaries —
The Company holds an investment in a 50/50 joint venture arrangement with shared control with CME Group that combines each company’s post-trade services into a joint venture, OSTTRA.  The joint venture provides trade processing and risk mitigation operations and incorporates CME’s optimization businesses (Traiana, TriOptima, and Reset) and the Company’s MarkitSERV business.  The combination is intended to increase operating efficiencies of both businesses to more effectively service clients with enhanced platforms and services for OTC markets across interest rate, FX, equity, and credit  asset classes.  Equity in Income on Unconsolidated Subsidiaries includes the OSTTRA joint venture. Equity in Income on Unconsolidated Subsidiaries was $11 million for the three months ended March 31, 2025 compared to $6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024.
On April 14, 2025, the Company and CME Group entered into an agreement to sell OSTTRA to investment funds managed by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. (“KKR”), a leading global investment firm. The terms of the deal for OSTTRA equaled total enterprise value at $3.1 billion, subject to customary purchase price adjustments, which will be divided evenly between the Company and CME Group pursuant to the 50/50 joint venture. We currently anticipate the sale to result in a pre-tax gain of $220 million ($140 million after-tax) for the Company, including the impact of accumulated other comprehensive income related to our investment. The transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2025, subject to customary closing conditions and receipt of required regulatory approvals.
Foreign exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on operating profit of 1 percentage point. This impact refers to currency comparisons and the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities. Currency impacts are estimated by re-calculating current year results of foreign operations using the average exchange rate from the prior year. Remeasurement impacts are based on the variance between current-year and prior-year foreign exchange rate fluctuations on assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the individual business’s functional currency.
Other Expense (Income), net
Other expense (income), net includes gains and losses on our mark-to-market investments and the net periodic benefit cost for our retirement and post retirement plans. Other expense, net was $4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2025 compared to other income, net of $9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024 primarily due to losses on our mark-to-market investments in 2025 compared to gains in 2024.
Interest Expense, net
Interest expense, net remained unchanged compared to the three months ended March 31, 2024 primarily due to an increase in interest expense related to uncertain tax liabilities offset by higher interest income from invested cash due to a more favorable interest rate environment combined with a benefit from our net investment hedge program.
Provision for Income Taxes
The effective income tax rate was 21.7% and 18.8% for the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively. The higher rate for the three months ended March 31, 2025 was primarily due to change in mix of income by jurisdiction. The lower rate for the three months ended March 31, 2024 was primarily due to a combination of discrete adjustments.
The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”) introduced an international tax framework under Pillar Two which includes a global minimum tax of 15%. This framework has been implemented by several jurisdictions, including jurisdictions in which we operate, with effect from January 1, 2024, and many other jurisdictions, including jurisdictions in which we operate, are in the process of implementing it. The effect of enacted Pillar Two taxes has been included in the results disclosed and did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. The Company continues to monitor jurisdictions that are expected to implement Pillar Two in the future, and it is in the process of evaluating the potential impact of the enactment of Pillar Two by such jurisdictions on its consolidated financial statements.

The following table provides revenue and segment operating profit information for the three months ended March 31:
1
2025 includes employee severance charges of $14 million, acquisition-related costs of $7 million, Executive Leadership Team transition costs of $4 million and disposition-related costs of $1 million. 2024 includes employee severance charges of $31 million, IHS Markit merger costs of $11 million and acquisition-related costs of $3 million. 2025 and 2024 also include amortization of intangibles from acquisitions of $148 million and $140 million, respectively.
Revenue increased 5% primarily due to subscription revenue growth in Data, Analytics & Insights driven by the favorable impact of the acquisition of Visible Alpha in May of 2024, growth in RatingsXpress®, RatingsDirect® and Credit Analytics within Credit & Risk Solutions and growth for work flow solutions in Enterprise Solutions, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of the sale of Fincentric in August of 2024. An increase in recurring variable revenue due to increased volumes also contributed to revenue growth. Foreign exchange rates had an unfavorable impact of less than 1 percentage point.
Operating profit increased 16%. Excluding the impact of higher employee severance charges in 2024 of 17 percentage points and IHS merger costs in 2024 of 11 percentage points, partially offset by higher amortization of intangibles from acquisitions in 2025 of 8 percentage points, Executive Leadership Team transition costs in 2025 of 5 percentage points, higher acquisition-related costs in 2025 of 3 percentage points and disposition-related costs in 2025 of 1 percentage point, operating profit increased 5% primarily due to revenue growth and lower outside services expenses, partially offset by higher compensation costs driven by annual merit increases and additional headcount and expenses associated with the acquisition of Visible Alpha. Foreign exchange rates had a favorable impact of less than 1 percentage point.

Ratings
Ratings is an independent provider of credit ratings, research, and analytics, offering investors and other market participants information, ratings and benchmarks. Credit ratings are one of several tools investors can use when making decisions about purchasing bonds and other fixed income investments. They are opinions about credit risk and our ratings express our opinion about the ability and willingness of an issuer, such as a corporation or state or city government, to meet its financial obligations in full and on time. Our credit ratings can also relate to the credit quality of an individual debt issue, such as a corporate or municipal bond, and the relative likelihood that the issue may default.
36
Ratings disaggregates its revenue between transaction and non-transaction. Transaction revenue primarily includes fees associated with:
•
ratings related to new issuance of corporate and government debt instruments, as well as structured finance debt instruments; and
•
bank loan ratings.
Non-transaction revenue primarily includes fees for surveillance of a credit rating, annual fees for customer relationship-based pricing programs, fees for entity credit ratings and global research and analytics at Crisil. Non-transaction revenue also includes an intersegment royalty charged to Market Intelligence for the rights to use and distribute content and data developed by Ratings. Royalty revenue was $42 million and $40 million for the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively.
The following table provides revenue and segment operating profit information for the three months ended March 31:
1
2025 and 2024 include employee severance charges of $2 million and amortization of intangibles from acquisitions of $2 million and $7 million, respectively.
Revenue increased 8%, with an unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates of 1 percentage point. Non-transaction revenue increased primarily due to an increase in volume related to surveillance, commercial paper, and medium-term notes. Transaction revenue increased primarily due to structured finance revenue driven by increased collateralized loan obligations (“CLOs”), bank loan ratings revenue due to higher M&A activity, and U.S. Public Finance revenue due to an increase in issuance volumes.
Operating profit increased 11% primarily due to revenue growth, partially offset by higher compensation costs driven by annual merit increases and additional headcount, and an increase in strategic investments. Foreign exchange rates had an unfavorable impact of 2 percentage points.
37
Billed Issuance Volumes
We monitor billed issuance volumes regularly within Ratings. Billed issuance excludes items that do not impact transaction revenue, such as issuance from frequent issuer programs, unrated debt, and most international public finance to more effectively correlate issuance activity to movements in transaction revenue.
The following table provides billed issuance levels based on Ratings’ internal data feeds for the three months ended March 31:
Note - Totals presented may not sum due to rounding.
*
Includes Corporates, Financial Services and Infrastructure.
**
Includes Bank Loans, Structured Finance and Government.
First quarter billed issuance was up due to increases in bank loans and structured finance. Structured finance billed issuance increases were driven primarily by new CLO issuance.

2025 includes employee severance charges of $6 million. 2024 includes IHS Markit merger costs of $5 million. 2025 and 2024 also include amortization of intangibles from acquisitions of $33 million and $32 million, respectively.
Revenue increased 9% primarily due to continued demand for market data and market insights products driven by expanded product offerings to our existing customers under enterprise use contracts and an increase in conference revenue driven by increased attendance at CERAWeek in 2025. An increase in sales usage-based royalties from the licensing of our proprietary market data to commodity exchanges due to increased trading volumes for Platts based contracts across most commodity sectors also contributed to revenue growth. Revenue was favorably impacted by the acquisition of World Hydrogen Leaders in May of 2024. All four business lines contributed to revenue growth in the first quarter of 2025 with the Advisory & Transactional Services and Energy & Resources Data & Insights businesses being the most significant drivers, followed by the Price Assessments and Upstream Data & Insights businesses. Foreign exchange rates had an unfavorable impact of 1 percentage point.
Operating profit increased 13%. Excluding the impact of higher employee severance charges in 2025 of 9 percentage points, partially offset by IHS Markit merger costs in 2024 of 7 percentage points, operating profit increased 11%. The increase was primarily due to revenue growth, partially offset by higher compensation costs driven by annual merit increases and additional headcount, investment in strategic initiatives and expenses associated with the acquisition of World Hydrogen Leaders. Foreign exchange rates had an unfavorable impact of 1 percentage point.

The following table provides revenue and segment operating profit information for the three months ended March 31:
1
2024 includes IHS Markit merger costs of $1 million and employee severance charges of $1 million. 2025 and 2024 also include amortization of intangibles from acquisitions of $9 million.
Revenue at Indices increased 15% primarily due to an increase in asset linked fees revenue driven by higher levels of assets under management (“AUM”) for ETFs and mutual funds, higher exchange-traded derivative revenue driven by continued strength in trading volume and higher data subscription revenue. Ending AUM for ETFs increased 18% to $4.304 trillion compared to March 31, 2024 and average levels of AUM for ETFs increased 30% to $4.462 trillion compared to the three months ended March 31, 2024. Foreign exchange rates had an unfavorable impact of less than 1 percentage point.
Operating profit increased 16%. Excluding the impact of IHS Markit merger costs in 2024 of 1 percentage point, operating profit increased 15% due to revenue growth partially offset by higher compensation costs driven by annual merit increases, an increase in bad debt expense and an increase in strategic investments.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
We continue to maintain a strong financial position. Our primary source of funds for operations is cash from our businesses. Cash on hand, cash flows from operations and availability under our existing credit facility are expected to be sufficient to meet any additional operating and recurring cash needs into the foreseeable future. We use our cash for a variety of needs, including but not limited to: ongoing investments in our businesses, strategic acquisitions, share repurchases, dividends, repayment of debt, capital expenditures and investment in our infrastructure.
42
Cash Flow Overview
Cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash were $1,469 million as of March 31, 2025, a decrease of $197 million from December 31, 2024.
The following table provides cash flow information for the three months ended March 31:
N/M – Represents a change equal to or in excess of 100% or not meaningful
In the first three months of 2025, free cash flow decreased $35 million to $816 million compared to $851 million in the first three months of 2024. The decrease is primarily due to an increase in cash used for capital expenditures and distributions to noncontrolling interest holders. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure and reflects our cash flow provided by operating activities less capital expenditures and distributions to noncontrolling interest holders. Capital expenditures include purchases of property and equipment and additions to technology projects. See “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Information” below for a reconciliation of cash flow provided by operating activities, the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure, to free cash flow.
Operating activities
Cash provided by operating activities remained relatively unchanged for the first three months of 2025 compared to 2024. This is primarily attributable to higher operating results and higher billings in 2025, partially offset by higher compensation payments in 2025 and proceeds received from the termination of interest rate swaps in 2024.
The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”) introduced an international tax framework under Pillar Two which includes a global minimum tax of 15%. This framework has been implemented by several jurisdictions, including jurisdictions in which we operate, with effect from January 1, 2024, and many other jurisdictions, including jurisdictions in which we operate, are in the process of implementing it. The effect of enacted Pillar Two taxes has been included in the results disclosed and did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. The Company continues to monitor jurisdictions that are expected to implement Pillar Two in the future, and it is in the process of evaluating the potential impact of the enactment of Pillar Two by such jurisdictions on its consolidated financial statements.
Investing activities
Our cash outflows from investing activities are primarily for acquisitions and capital expenditures, while cash inflows are primarily proceeds from dispositions.
Cash used for investing activities increased to $79 million for the first three months of 2025 compared to $20 million in the first three months of 2024, primarily due to higher cash paid for short-term investments and capital expenditures in 2025.
Financing activities
Our cash outflows from financing activities consist primarily of share repurchases, dividends to shareholders and repayments of short-term and long-term debt, while cash inflows are primarily attributable to the borrowing of short-term and long-term debt.
Cash used for financing activities increased $446 million to $1,103 million for the first three months of 2025. The increase is primarily attributable to proceeds received from commercial paper borrowings in 2024 and an increase in cash used for share repurchases in 2025.
During the three months ended March 31, 2025, we purchased a total of 1.0 million shares for $650 million of cash. During the three months ended March 31, 2024, we purchased a total of 1.0 million shares for $500 million of cash. See Note 8

Additional Financing
We have the ability to borrow a total of $2.0 billion through our commercial paper program, which is supported by our $2.0 billion five-year credit agreement (our “credit facility”) that will terminate on December 17, 2029. As of March 31, 2025, and December 31, 2024, we had no outstanding commercial paper.
Commitment fees for the unutilized commitments under the credit facility and applicable margins for borrowings thereunder are linked to the Company achieving three environmental sustainability performance indicators related to emissions, tested annually. For the three months ended March 31, 2025, we paid a commitment fee of 7 basis points. There will be no sustainability pricing adjustment to our commitment fees or our margins under the credit facility for the approximately year-long period beginning April 7, 2025 as a result of our emissions performance for the year ended December 31, 2024. The credit facility contains customary affirmative and negative covenants and customary events of default. The occurrence of an event of default could result in an acceleration of the obligations under the credit facility.
T
he only financial covenant required is that our indebtedness to cash flow ratio, as defined in our credit facility, was not greater than 4 to 1, and this covenant level
has never been exceeded.
Dividends
On January 28, 2025, the Board of Directors approved a quarterly common stock dividend of $0.96 per share.

Summarized balance sheet information as of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024 is as follows:
RECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION
Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure and reflects our cash flow provided by operating activities less capital expenditures and distributions to noncontrolling interest holders. Capital expenditures include purchases of property and equipment and additions to technology projects. Our cash flow provided by operating activities is the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure to free cash flow.
We believe the presentation of free cash flow allows our investors to evaluate the cash generated from our underlying operations in a manner similar to the method used by management. We use free cash flow to conduct and evaluate our business because we believe it typically presents a more conservative measure of cash flows since capital expenditures and distributions to noncontrolling interest holders are considered a necessary component of ongoing operations. Free cash flow is useful for management and investors because it allows management and investors to evaluate the cash available to us to prepay debt, make strategic acquisitions and investments and repurchase stock.

The presentation of free cash flow is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Free cash flow, as we calculate it, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies. The following table presents a reconciliation of our cash flow provided by operating activities to free cash flow for the three months ended March 31:

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES
Our accounting policies are described in Note 1
—
Accounting Policies
to the consolidated financial statements in our most recent Form 10-K. As discussed in Item 7,
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
, in our most recent Form 10-K, we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if it required assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made and changes in the estimate or different estimates could have a material effect on our results of operations. These critical estimates include those related to revenue recognition, business combinations, allowance for doubtful accounts, valuation of long-lived assets, goodwill and other intangible assets, pension plans, incentive compensation and stock-based compensation, income taxes, contingencies and redeemable noncontrolling interests. We base our estimates on historical experience, current developments and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under these circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that cannot readily be determined from other sources. There can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates. Since the date of our most recent Form 10-K, there have been no material changes to our critical accounting estimates.

•
following the separation of Mobility, the combined value of the common stock of the two publicly-traded companies not being equal to or greater than the value of the Company’s common stock had the separation not occurred.
The factors noted above are not exhaustive. The Company and its subsidiaries operate in a dynamic business environment in which new risks emerge frequently. Accordingly, the Company cautions readers not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the dates on which they are made. The Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances arising after the date on which it is made, except as required by applicable law.

Item 3.
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
Our exposure to market risk includes changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates. We have operations in foreign countries where the functional currency is primarily the local currency. For international operations that are determined to be extensions of the parent company, the U.S. dollar is the functional currency. We typically have naturally hedged positions in most countries from a local currency perspective with offsetting assets and liabilities. As of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, we have entered into foreign exchange forward contracts in order to mitigate the change in fair value of specific assets and liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet. These forward contracts are not designated as hedges and do not qualify for hedge accounting. As of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, we have entered into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge the effect of adverse fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. As of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, we held cross currency swaps to hedge a portion of our net investment in certain European subsidiaries against volatility in the Euro/U.S. dollar exchange rate. We have not entered into any derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. See Note 5 -

Controls and Procedures
Disclosure Controls and Procedures
We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed so that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”), as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
As of March 31, 2025, an evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of management, including the CEO and CFO, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Based on that evaluation, management, including the CEO and CFO, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of March 31, 2025.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the most recent quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Item 1A.
Risk Factors
In addition to the other information set forth in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, you should carefully consider the risk factors we have previously disclosed in Item 1A,
Risk Factors
, in our most recent Form 10-K, and the additional risk factor below.
The planned separation of our Mobility business into an independent, publicly traded company is contingent upon the satisfaction of a number of conditions, may not be completed on the currently contemplated timeline, or at all, and may not achieve the intended benefits.
On April 29, 2025, we announced our intent to pursue a separation of our Mobility business through a spin-off to our shareholders. The proposed separation is subject to various conditions, is complex in nature, and may be affected by unanticipated developments. The separation is intended to qualify as a tax-free transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. There can be no assurance regarding the ultimate timing of the separation or that such separation will be completed. Unanticipated developments could delay, prevent or otherwise adversely affect the separation, including but not limited to disruptions in general or financial market conditions or potential problems or delays in satisfying required conditions. Such developments could cause the separation to occur on terms or conditions that are less favorable than anticipated. In addition, we may not be able to achieve the full strategic and financial benefits that we anticipate to result from the separation, or such benefits may be delayed or not occur at all. The anticipated benefits of the separation are based on a number of assumptions, some of which may prove incorrect. We also expect to incur significant expenses in connection with the separation, certain of which will be incurred even if the separation is not completed. Executing the separation will require significant resources, time and attention from our senior management and employees, which could divert attention and resources away from other projects and the day-to-day operation of our business. We may experience negative reactions from financial markets if we do not complete the separation in a reasonable time period. Following the proposed separation, the combined value of the shares of the two publicly-traded companies may not be equal to or greater than what the value of our shares would have been had the separation not occurred. The above factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or the price of our shares.
Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds
On June 22, 2022, the Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing the purchase of 30 million shares (the “2022 Repurchase Program”), which was approximately 9% of the total shares of our outstanding common stock at that time. During the first quarter of 2025, we received 1.3 millions shares, which included 0.3 million shares received from our accelerated share repurchase (“ASR”) agreement that we entered into on October 28, 2024. Further discussion relating to our ASR agreements can be found in Note 8 -
Equity
. As of March 31, 2025, 10.7 million shares remained under the 2022 Repurchase Program.
Repurchased shares may be used for general corporate purposes, including the issuance of shares for stock compensation plans and to offset the dilutive effect of the exercise of employee stock options. Our 2022 Repurchase Program has no expiration date and purchases under this program may be made from time to time on the open market and in private transactions, depending on market conditions.
The following table provides information on our purchases of our outstanding common stock during the first quarter of 2025 pursuant to the 2022 Repurchase Program (column c). In addition to these purchases, the number of shares in column (a) include shares of common stock that are tendered to us to satisfy our employees’ tax withholding obligations in connection with the vesting of awards of restricted shares (we repurchase such shares based on their fair market value on the vesting date).
50
There were no other share repurchases during the quarter outside the repurchases noted below.
1
Includes 0.3 million shares received from the conclusion of our ASR agreement that we entered into on October 28, 2024.
2
Includes 1.0 million shares received from the initiation of our ASR agreement that we entered into on February 19, 2025. Average price paid
per share information does not include this accelerated share repurchase transaction.
