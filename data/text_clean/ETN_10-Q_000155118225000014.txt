Note 1.
BASIS OF PRESENTATION
The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of Eaton Corporation plc (Eaton or the Company) have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for interim financial information, the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by United States generally accepted accounting principles (US GAAP) for complete financial statements. However, in the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) have been made that are necessary for a fair presentation of the condensed consolidated financial statements for the interim periods.
This Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in Eaton’s 2024 Form 10-K. The interim period results are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year. Management has evaluated subsequent events through the date this Form 10-Q was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Adoption of New Accounting Standard
Eaton adopted Accounting Standards Update 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures, in the fourth quarter of 2024 on a retrospective basis. This accounting standard requires additional segment disclosures on an annual and interim basis, including significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker. The standard does not change how operating segments and reportable segments are determined. The adoption of the standard did not have a material impact on the condensed consolidated financial statements.
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
In December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures (ASU 2023-09). This accounting standard requires disaggregated income tax disclosures on an annual basis, including information on the Company’s effective income tax rate reconciliation and income taxes paid. ASU 2023-09 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2024, and may be applied prospectively or retrospectively. The Company is evaluating the impact of ASU 2023-09 and expects the standard will only impact its income taxes disclosures with no material impact to the consolidated financial statements.
In November 2024, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2024-03, Income Statement – Reporting Comprehensive Income – Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses (ASU 2024-03). This accounting standard requires disaggregated income statement expense disclosures on an annual and interim basis, including inventory purchases, employee compensation, depreciation, and intangible asset amortization for each income statement line item that contains these expenses. The standard also requires disclosure of total selling expenses on an annual and interim basis, and the definition of those expenses disclosed annually. ASU 2024-03 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2026 and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2027, and may be applied prospectively or retrospectively. The Company is evaluating the impact of ASU 2024-03 and expects the standard will only impact its disclosures with no material impact to the consolidated financial statements.

ACQUISITIONS OF BUSINESSES
Acquisition of Exertherm
On May 20, 2024, Eaton acquired Exertherm, a U.K.-based provider of thermal monitoring solutions for electrical equipment. Exertherm is reported within the Electrical Americas business segment.
Acquisition of a
49
%
stake in NordicEPOD AS
On May 31, 2024, Eaton acquired a
49
percent stake in NordicEPOD AS, which designs and assembles standardized power modules for data centers in the Nordic region. Eaton accounts for this investment on the equity method of accounting and it is reported within the Electrical Global business segment.
Acquisition of Fibrebond Corporation
On April 1, 2025, Eaton acquired Fibrebond Corporation (Fibrebond) for $
1.45
billion, net of cash acquired. Fibrebond is a U.S. based designer and builder of pre-integrated modular power enclosures for data center, industrial, utility and communications customers. Fibrebond had sales of approximately $
378
million for the twelve months ended February 28, 2025 and will be reported within the Electrical Americas business segment.
The acquisition of Fibrebond will be accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting. Due to the timing of the closing date, the Company is unable to provide the preliminary estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date.
As part of the acquisition, Eaton assumed $
240
million of employee transaction and retention awards. Awards will vest in
six
equal annual installments starting in the second quarter of 2025, subject to continued employment with Eaton. Forfeited employee awards will be paid to former Fibrebond shareholders annually. Eaton will recognize compensation expense for the awards over the requisite service period and any employee forfeitures owed to former Fibrebond shareholders will be expensed immediately in Other income - net.

REVENUE RECOGNITION
Sales are recognized when obligations under the terms of the contract are satisfied and control of promised goods or services have transferred to our customers. Control is transferred when the customer has the ability to direct the use of and obtain benefits from the goods or services. Sales are measured at the amount of consideration the Company expects to be paid in exchange for these products or services.
The following table provides disaggregated sales by lines of businesses, geographic destination, market channel or end market, as applicable, for the Company's operating segments:
The timing of revenue recognition, billings and cash collections results in billed accounts receivable, unbilled receivables (revenue recognized exceeds amount billed to the customer), and deferred revenue (advance payments and billings in excess of revenue recognized). Accounts receivable from customers were $
4,592
million and $
4,079
million at March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively. Amounts are billed as work progresses in accordance with agreed-upon contractual terms, either at periodic intervals or upon achievement of contractual milestones. These assets and liabilities are reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets on a contract-by-contract basis at the end of each reporting period. Unbilled receivables were $
392
million and $
330
million at March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively, and are recorded in Prepaid expenses and other current assets. The increase in unbilled receivables reflects higher revenue recognized and not yet billed from increased business activity in 2025.

Changes in the deferred revenue liabilities are as follows:
Deferred revenue liabilities of $
647
million and $
602
million as of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively, were included in Other current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets with the remaining balance presented in Other noncurrent liabilities.
A significant portion of open orders placed with Eaton are by original equipment manufacturers or distributors. These open orders are not considered firm as they have been historically subject to releases by customers. In measuring backlog of unsatisfied or partially satisfied obligations, only the amount of orders to which customers are firmly committed are included. Using this criterion, total backlog at March 31, 2025 was approximately $
16.0
billion. At March 31, 2025, approximately
74
% of this backlog is targeted for delivery to customers in the next
twelve months
and the rest thereafter.
Note 4.
CREDIT LOSSES FOR RECEIVABLES
Receivables are exposed to credit risk based on the customers’ ability to pay which is influenced by, among other factors, their financial liquidity position. Eaton’s receivables are generally short-term in nature with a majority outstanding less than 90 days.
Eaton performs ongoing credit evaluation of its customers and maintains sufficient allowances for potential credit losses. The Company evaluates the collectability of its receivables based on the length of time the receivable is past due, and any anticipated future write-off based on historic experience adjusted for market conditions. The Company's segments, supported by our global credit department, perform the credit evaluation and monitoring process to estimate and manage credit risk. The process includes an evaluation of credit losses for both the overall segment receivable and specific customer balances. The process also includes review of customer financial information and credit ratings, approval and monitoring of customer credit limits, and an assessment of market conditions. The Company may also require prepayment from customers to mitigate credit risk. Receivable balances are written off against an allowance for credit losses after a final determination of collectability has been made.
Accounts receivable are net of an allowance for credit losses of $
52
million and $
55
million at March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively. The change in the allowance for credit losses includes expense and net write-offs, none of which are significant.

SUPPLY CHAIN FINANCE PROGRAM
The Company negotiates payment terms directly with its suppliers for the purchase of goods and services. In addition, a third-party financial institution offers a voluntary supply chain finance (SCF) program that enables certain of the Company’s suppliers, at the supplier’s sole discretion, to sell receivables due from the Company to the financial institution on terms directly negotiated with the financial institution. If a supplier elects to participate in the SCF program, the supplier decides which invoices are sold to the financial institution and the Company has no economic interest in a supplier’s decision to sell an invoice. Payments by the Company to participating suppliers are paid to the financial institution on the invoice due date, regardless of whether an individual invoice is sold by the supplier to the financial institution. The amounts due to the financial institution for suppliers that participate in the SCF program are included in
Accounts payable
on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, and the associated payments are included in operating activities on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.
The changes in SCF obligations are as follows:

The components of retirement benefits expense (income) other than service costs are included in Other income - net.
During 2020, the Company announced it was freezing its United States pension plans for its non-union employees. The freeze was effective January 1, 2021 for non-union U.S. employees whose retirement benefit was determined under a cash balance formula and is effective January 1, 2026 for non-union U.S. employees whose retirement benefit is determined under a final average pay formula.
Note 9.
LEGAL CONTINGENCIES
Eaton is subject to a broad range of claims, administrative and legal proceedings, including claims for punitive damages, penalties, and interest, in a variety of matters, including contract, indemnity, tax, patent infringement, intellectual property, personal injury, commercial, warranty, product liability, environmental, antitrust and trade regulation, class action, and labor and employment matters. Eaton is also subject to legal claims from historic products which may have contained asbestos. Insurance may cover some of the costs associated with these claims and proceedings. Although it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome or cost of these matters, the Company believes they will not have a material adverse effect on the condensed consolidated financial statements.

EATON SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY
The changes in Shareholders’ equity are as follows:
On February 23, 2022, the Board of Directors adopted a share repurchase program for repurchases of ordinary shares up to $
5.0
billion to be made during the
three-year
period commencing on that date (2022 Program). On February 27, 2025, the Board of Directors renewed the 2022 Program by providing authority for up to $
9.0
billion in repurchases to be made during the
three-year
period commencing on that date (2025 Program). Under the 2025 Program, the ordinary shares are expected to be repurchased over time, depending on market conditions, the market price of ordinary shares, capital levels, and other considerations. During the three months ended March 31, 2025,
1.9
million ordinary shares were repurchased under the 2025 and 2022 Programs in the open market at a total cost of $
608
million. During the three months ended March 31, 2024,

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS
Fair value is measured based on an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to satisfy a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. Fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. As a basis for considering such assumptions, a fair value hierarchy is established, which categorizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows: (Level 1) observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; (Level 2) inputs, other than the quoted prices in active markets, that are observable either directly or indirectly; and (Level 3) unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions.
A summary of financial instruments recognized at fair value, and the fair value measurements used, is as follows:
Eaton values its financial instruments using an industry standard market approach, in which prices and other relevant information is generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities.
Other Fair Value Measurements
Long-term debt and the current portion of long-term debt had a carrying value of $
9,275
million and fair value of $
8,847
million at March 31, 2025 compared to $
9,152
million and $
8,651
million, respectively, at December 31, 2024. The fair value of Eaton's debt instruments was estimated using prevailing market interest rates on debt with similar creditworthiness, terms and maturities and is considered a Level 2 fair value measurement.

Note 12.
DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES
In the normal course of business, Eaton is exposed to certain risks related to fluctuations in interest rates, currency exchange rates and commodity prices. The Company uses various derivative and non-derivative financial instruments, primarily interest rate swaps, currency forward exchange contracts, currency swaps and commodity contracts to manage risks from these market fluctuations. The instruments used by Eaton are straightforward, non-leveraged instruments. The counterparties to these instruments are financial institutions with strong credit ratings. Eaton maintains control over the size of positions entered into with any one counterparty and regularly monitors the credit rating of these institutions. Such instruments are not purchased and sold for trading purposes.
Derivative financial instruments are accounted for at fair value and recognized as assets or liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Accounting for the gain or loss resulting from the change in the fair value of the derivative financial instrument depends on whether it has been designated as part of a hedging relationship, is effective and the nature of the hedging activity. Eaton formally documents all relationships between derivative financial instruments accounted for as designated hedges and the hedged item, as well as its risk-management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge transaction. This process includes linking derivative financial instruments to a recognized asset or liability, specific firm commitment, forecasted transaction, or net investment in a foreign operation. These financial instruments can be designated as:
•
Hedges of the change in the fair value of a recognized fixed-rate asset or liability, or the firm commitment to acquire such an asset or liability (a fair value hedge); for these hedges, the gain or loss from the derivative financial instrument, as well as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk, are recognized in income during the period of change in fair value.
•
Hedges of the variable cash flows of a recognized variable-rate asset or liability, or the forecasted acquisition of such an asset or liability (a cash flow hedge); for these hedges, the gain or loss from the derivative financial instrument is recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive income and reclassified to income in the same period when the gain or loss on the hedged item is included in income.
•
Hedges of the currency exposure related to a net investment in a foreign operation (a net investment hedge); for these hedges, the gain or loss from the derivative financial instrument is recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive income and reclassified to income in the same period when the gain or loss related to the net investment in the foreign operation is included in income.
The gain or loss from a derivative financial instrument designated as a hedge is classified in the same line of the Consolidated Statements of Income as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item. The cash flows resulting from these financial instruments are classified in operating activities on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.
For derivatives that are not designated as a hedge, any gain or loss is immediately recognized in income. The majority of derivatives used in this manner relate to risks resulting from assets or liabilities denominated in a foreign currency and certain commodity contracts that arise in the normal course of business.
Eaton uses currency exchange contracts, cross-currency interest rate swaps, and certain of its debt denominated in foreign currency to hedge portions of its net investments in foreign operations against foreign currency exposure (net investment hedges). The Company uses the spot rate method to assess hedge effectiveness when derivative financial instruments are used in net investment hedges. Under this method, changes in the fair value of currency exchange contracts attributable to changes in the spot exchange rate and changes in the fair value of cross-currency interest rate swaps are recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive loss. Changes related to the forward rate of currency exchange contracts are excluded from the hedging relationship and the forward points are amortized to Interest expense - net on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract. Interest accruals on cross-currency interest rate swaps are excluded from the hedging relationship and recognized in Interest expense - net. The cash flows resulting from currency exchange contracts and cross-currency interest rate swaps are classified in investing activities on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

Table of Contents
Derivative Financial Statement Impacts
The fair value of derivative financial instruments recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheets is as follows:
The currency exchange contracts shown in the table above as derivatives not designated as hedges are primarily contracts entered into to manage currency volatility or exposure on intercompany receivables, payables and loans. While Eaton does not elect hedge accounting treatment for these derivatives, Eaton targets managing
95
% to
100
% of the intercompany balance sheet exposure to minimize the effect of currency volatility related to the movement of goods and services in the normal course of its operations. This activity represents the great majority of these currency exchange contracts. The cash flows resulting from the settlement of these derivatives have been classified in investing activities in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.
Foreign currency denominated debt designated as non-derivative net investment hedging instruments had a carrying value on an after-tax basis of $
3,229
million at March 31, 2025 and $
3,105
million at December 31, 2024.
As of March 31, 2025, the volume of outstanding commodity contracts that were entered into to hedge forecasted transactions:

RESTRUCTURING CHARGES
During the first quarter of 2024, Eaton implemented a multi-year restructuring program to accelerate opportunities to optimize its operations and global support structure. These actions will better align the Company's functions to support anticipated growth and drive greater effectiveness throughout the Company. Since the inception of the program, the Company has incurred charges of $
220
million. This restructuring program is expected to be completed in 2026 and is expected to incur additional expenses related to workforce reductions of $
171
million and plant closing and other costs of $
84
million, resulting in total estimated charges of $
475
million for the entire program.

BUSINESS SEGMENT INFORMATION
Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated on a regular basis by the chief operating decision maker, or decision making group, in deciding how to allocate resources to an individual segment and in assessing performance. The Company's chief operating decision maker is the chairman and chief executive officer. Eaton's operating segments are Electrical Americas, Electrical Global, Aerospace, Vehicle, and eMobility. Operating profit (loss) includes the operating profit from intersegment sales. For additional information regarding Eaton's business segments, see Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements contained in the 2024 Form 10-K.
The chief operating decision maker uses segment operating profit (loss) as an input to assess segment performance and determine appropriate resource allocations, including capital, financial, and employee resources. Segment operating profit (loss) results are regularly evaluated versus annual profit plan, forecast and/or prior year.
Other segment items are primarily comprised of Cost of products sold, Selling and administrative expense, Research and development expense, depreciation of property, plant and equipment, and certain items included in Other income – net on the Consolidated Statements of Income. The Company's chief operating decision maker manages these items on a consolidated basis.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
The following discussion of Consolidated Financial Results includes certain non-GAAP financial measures. These financial measures include adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings per ordinary share, each of which differs from the most directly comparable measure calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). A reconciliation of adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings per ordinary share to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is included in the Consolidated Financial Results table below.

LIQUIDITY, CAPITAL RESOURCES, AND FINANCIAL CONDITION
Liquidity and Financial Condition
Eaton’s objective is to finance its business through operating cash flow and an appropriate mix of equity and long-term and short-term debt. By diversifying its debt maturity structure, Eaton reduces liquidity risk.
The Company maintains revolving credit facilities consisting of a $500 million 364-day revolving credit facility that will expire on September 29, 2025 and a $2,500 million five-year revolving credit facility that will expire on October 1, 2027. The revolving credit facilities totaling $3,000 million are used to support commercial paper borrowings and are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Eaton and certain of its direct and indirect subsidiaries on an unsubordinated, unsecured basis. There were no borrowings outstanding under Eaton’s revolving credit facilities at March 31, 2025. The Company maintains access to the commercial paper markets through its $3,000 million commercial paper program, of which $800 million was outstanding on March 31, 2025, used primarily with funding the acquisition of Fibrebond Corporation.
Over the course of a year, cash, short-term investments, and short-term debt may fluctuate in order to manage global liquidity. As of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, Eaton had cash of $1,777 million and $555 million, short-term investments of $162 million and $1,525 million, respectively, with $805 million short-term debt as of March 31, 2025 and no short-term debt as of December 31, 2024. Eaton believes it has the operating flexibility, cash flow, cash and short-term investment balances, availability under existing revolving credit facilities, and access to capital markets in excess of the liquidity necessary to meet future operating needs of the business, fund capital expenditures and acquisitions of businesses, as well as scheduled payments of long-term debt.
On April 1, 2025, the Company paid $1.45 billion, net of cash acquired, to acquire Fibrebond Corporation.
Eaton was in compliance with each of its debt covenants for all periods presented.
Cash Flows
A summary of cash flows is as follows:
Operating Cash Flow
Net cash provided by operating activities decreased by $237 million in the first three months of 2025 compared to 2024. Material factors affecting this decrease were higher working capital balances of $389 million, partially offset by higher net income of $143 million.
Investing Cash Flow
Net cash provided by investing activities increased by $1,200 million in the first three months of 2025 compared to 2024. The material factor affecting this increase was an increase in sales of short-term investments to $1,366 million in 2025 from $150 million in 2024.
Financing Cash Flow
Net cash used in financing activities decreased by $292 million in the first three months of 2025 compared to 2024. Material factors affecting this decrease were net proceeds of short-term debt of $805 million in 2025 compared to net payments of short-term debt of $7 million in 2024, partially offset by an increase in repurchase of shares to $615 million in 2025 from $138 million in 2024.
Uses of Cash
Capital Expenditures
Capital expenditures were $147 million and $183 million in the first three months of 2025 and 2024, respectively. The Company plans to increase capital expenditures over the next several years to expand production capacity across various markets to support anticipated growth. As a result, Eaton expects approximately $900 million in capital expenditures in 2025.

Table of Contents
Dividends
Cash dividend payments were $397 million and $368 million in the first three months of 2025 and 2024, respectively. Payment of quarterly dividends in the future depends upon the Company’s ability to generate net income and operating cash flows, among other factors, and is subject to declaration by the Eaton Board of Directors. The Company intends to continue to pay quarterly dividends in 2025.
Share Repurchases
On February 23, 2022, the Board of Directors adopted a share repurchase program for repurchases of ordinary shares up to $5.0 billion to be made during the three-year period commencing on that date (2022 Program). On February 27, 2025, the Board of Directors renewed the 2022 Program by providing authority for up to $9.0 billion in repurchases to be made during the three-year period commencing on that date (2025 Program). Under the 2025 Program, the ordinary shares are expected to be repurchased over time, depending on market conditions, the market price of ordinary shares, capital levels, and other considerations. During the three months ended March 31, 2025, 1.9 million ordinary shares were repurchased under the 2025 and 2022 Programs in the open market at a total cost of $608 million. During the three months ended March 31, 2024, 0.5 million ordinary shares were repurchased under the 2022 program in the open market at a total cost of $138 million. The Company will continue to pursue share repurchases in 2025 depending on market conditions and capital levels.
Acquisition of Businesses and Investments in Associate Companies
There were no business acquisitions in the first three months of 2025 and 2024. The Company paid cash of $13 million for investments in associate companies in the first three months of 2025. There were no investments in associate companies in the first three months 2024. The Company will continue to focus on deploying its capital toward businesses that provide opportunities for higher growth and strong returns, and align with secular trends and its power management strategies.

At March 31, 2025, the Company had Short-term debt of $805 million, Current portion of long-term debt of $1,666 million, and Long-term debt of $7,609 million. The Company believes it has the operating flexibility, cash flow, and access to capital markets to meet scheduled payments of long-term debt.
Supply Chain Finance Program
A third-party financial institution offers a voluntary supply chain finance (SCF) program that enables certain of the Company’s suppliers, at the supplier’s sole discretion, to sell receivables due from the Company to the financial institution on terms directly negotiated with the financial institution. The SCF program does not have a significant impact on the Company’s liquidity as payments by the Company to participating suppliers are paid to the financial institution on the invoice due date, regardless of whether an individual invoice is sold by the supplier to the financial institution. For additional information on the SCF program, see Note 7.
Guaranteed Debt
Issuers, Guarantors and Guarantor Structure
Eaton Corporation has issued senior notes pursuant to indentures dated April 1, 1994 (the 1994 Indenture), November 20, 2012 (the 2012 Indenture), September 15, 2017 (the 2017 Indenture) and August 23, 2022 (as supplemented by the First and Second Supplemental Indentures of the same date and the Third Supplemental Indenture dated May 18, 2023, the 2022 Indenture). The senior notes of Eaton Corporation are registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Registered Senior Notes). Eaton Capital Unlimited Company, a subsidiary of Eaton, is the issuer of five outstanding series of debt securities sold in offshore transactions under Regulation S promulgated under the Securities Act (the Eurobonds). The Eurobonds and the Registered Senior Notes (together, the Senior Notes) comprise substantially all of Eaton’s long-term indebtedness.
Substantially all of the Senior Notes (with limited exceptions), together with the credit facilities described above under Liquidity and Financial Condition (the Credit Facilities), are guaranteed by Eaton and 17 of its subsidiaries. Accordingly, they rank equally with each other. However, because these obligations are not secured, they would be effectively subordinated to any existing or future secured indebtedness of Eaton and its subsidiaries. As of March 31, 2025, Eaton has no material, long-term secured debt. The guaranteed Registered Senior Notes are also structurally subordinated to the liabilities of Eaton's subsidiaries that are not guarantors. Except as described below under Future Guarantors, Eaton is not obligated to cause its subsidiaries to guarantee the Registered Senior Notes.
The table set forth in Exhibit 22 filed with the Form 10-K filed on February 23, 2023 (10-K Exhibit 22) details the primary obligors and guarantors with respect to the guaranteed Registered Senior Notes.

Table of Contents
Terms of Guarantees of Registered Securities
Payment of principal and interest on the Registered Senior Notes is guaranteed, on an unsecured, unsubordinated basis by the subsidiaries of Eaton set forth in the table referenced in the 10-K Exhibit 22. Each guarantee is full and unconditional, and joint and several. Each guarantor’s guarantee is an unsecured obligation that ranks equally with all its other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. The obligations of each guarantor under its guarantee of the Registered Senior Notes are subject to a customary savings clause or similar provision designed to prevent such guarantee from constituting a fraudulent conveyance or otherwise legally impermissible or voidable obligation.
Though the terms of the indentures vary slightly, generally, each guarantee of the Registered Senior Notes by a guarantor that is a subsidiary of Eaton Corporation provides that it will be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged under certain circumstances, including, but not limited to:
(a)
the consummation of certain types of transactions permitted under the applicable indenture, including one that results in such guarantor ceasing to be a subsidiary; and
(b)
for Registered Senior Notes issued under the 2022 Indenture, when such guarantor is a guarantor or issuer of indebtedness in an aggregate outstanding principal amount of less than 25% of our total outstanding indebtedness.
Further, each guarantee by a direct or indirect parent of Eaton Corporation (other than Eaton) provides that it will also be released if:
(c)
such guarantee (so long as the guarantor is not obligated under any other U.S. debt obligations), becomes prohibited by any applicable law, rule or regulation or by any contractual obligation; or
(d)
such guarantee results in material adverse tax consequences to Eaton or any of its subsidiaries (so long as the applicable guarantor is not obligated under any other U.S. debt obligation).
The guarantee of Eaton does not contain any release provisions.
Future Guarantors
The 2012 and 2017 Indentures generally provide that, with certain limited exceptions, any subsidiary of Eaton must become a guarantor if it becomes obligated as borrower or guarantor under any series of debt securities or a syndicated credit facility. Further, the 2012 and 2017 Indentures provide that any entity that becomes a direct or indirect parent entity of Eaton Corporation and holds any material assets, with certain limited exceptions, or owes any material liabilities must become a guarantor. The 2022 Indenture provides only that, with certain limited exceptions, any subsidiary of Eaton must become a guarantor if it becomes obligated as borrower or guarantor under indebtedness with an aggregate outstanding principal amount in excess of 25% of the Parent and its Subsidiaries’ then-outstanding indebtedness.
The 1994 Indenture does not contain provisions with respect to future guarantors.
Summarized Financial Information of Guarantors and Issuers
The financial information presented is that of Eaton Corporation and the Guarantors, which includes Eaton Corporation plc, on a combined basis and the financial information of non-issuer and non-guarantor subsidiaries has been excluded. Intercompany balances and transactions between Eaton Corporation and Guarantors have been eliminated, and amounts due from, amounts due to, and transactions with non-issuer and non-guarantor subsidiaries have been presented separately.
