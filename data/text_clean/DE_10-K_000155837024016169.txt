MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) is intended to promote understanding of our financial condition and results of operations. The MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. All amounts are presented in millions of dollars, unless otherwise specified. For comparison of 2023 to 2022 results, refer to the “Management’s Discussion and Analysis” section of our 2023 Form 10-K.
Deere & Company is a global leader in the production of agricultural, turf, construction, and forestry equipment and solutions. John Deere Financial provides financing for John Deere equipment, parts, services, and other inputs customers need to run their operations. Our operations are managed through the production and precision agriculture (PPA), small agriculture and turf (SAT), construction and forestry (CF), and financial services operating segments. References to “equipment operations” include PPA, SAT, and CF, while references to “agriculture and turf” include both PPA and SAT.

Company Trends
Customers seek to improve profitability, productivity, and sustainability through integrating technology into their operations. Deeper integration of technology into equipment is a persistent market trend. These technologies are incorporated into products within each of our operating segments. We expect this trend to persist for the foreseeable future. Our Smart Industrial Operating Model and Leap Ambitions are intended to capitalize on this market trend. Engaged acres are an indicator we use to understand customer utilization of our technology. We are investing in a Solutions as a Service business model to increase technology adoption and utilization by our customers. Solutions as a Service products did not represent a significant percentage of our revenues in 2024.

Additional Trends
Interest Rates
–
While interest rates in the U.S. began to decrease in the fourth quarter of 2024, they remained elevated. Increased rates impacted us in several ways, primarily affecting the demand for our products and financing spreads for the financial services operations.
The markets for our agriculture, turf, and construction products were negatively impacted in 2024 by elevated interest rates and their effect on borrowing costs for our customers.
Rising interest rates have historically impacted our borrowing costs sooner than the benefit is realized from receivable and lease portfolios.
Agricultural Market Business Cycle –
The agricultural market is affected by various factors including commodity prices, acreage planted, crop yields, and government policies. These factors affect farmers’ income and may result in varying demand for our equipment. In 2024, we experienced unfavorable market
conditions which resulted in lower sales volumes, higher sales incentives, higher receivable write-offs, and an increase in expected credit losses.
We introduced cost reduction measures to manage our profitability and inventory levels. In the third quarter of 2024, we implemented employee-separation programs for our salaried workforce to help meet our strategic priorities while reducing overlap and redundancy in roles and responsibilities. The programs’ total pretax expenses are estimated to be approximately $165, of which $157 was recorded in 2024 (see Note 4). Annual pretax savings from these programs are estimated to be about $220. Approximately $100 of savings was realized in 2024.
Changes in interest rates and the agricultural market business cycle are driven by factors outside of our control, and as a result we cannot reasonably foresee when these conditions will fully subside.
Other Items of Concern and Uncertainties –
Other items that could impact our results are:

Other Significant Statement of Consolidated Income Changes
An explanation of the cost of sales to net sales ratio and other significant statement of consolidated income changes follows:
​
​
​
​
​
Each equipment operations segment experienced lower shipment volumes partially offset by price realization during 2024. Rising global grain stocks, lower commodity prices, elevated interest rates, and the effect of inventory management contributed to lower shipment volumes for large and small agriculture. Declines in housing starts, decreases in rental purchases, lower levels of commercial real estate construction, and the effect of inventory management contributed to lower shipment volumes for construction equipment.
Production costs were favorable in 2024 due to lower material and employee profit-sharing incentives costs, partially offset by higher manufacturing overhead costs driven by lower volumes and production inefficiencies.
Production and Precision Agriculture Operations
​
​
​
​
Sales volumes decreased 17 percent in the U.S. and Canada, 40 percent in Brazil, and 30 percent in Europe. Price realization in the U.S. and Canada was 3 percent driven by inflation, which was partially offset by an increase in retail and pool funds sales incentives. Price realization was flat outside the U.S. and Canada

due to moderating market conditions. Current period results were impacted by special items (see Note 4).

Small Agriculture and Turf Operations
​
​
Sales volumes decreased 22 percent in the U.S. and Canada, 28 percent in Europe, and 45 percent in Mexico.
Price realization was 3 percent in the U.S. and Canada and 1 percent outside the U.S. and Canada driven by inflation. Current period results were impacted by special items (see Note 4).

and 1 percent outside the U.S. and Canada. Current and prior period results were impacted by special items (see Note 4).
Construction & Forestry Operating Profit
2024 compared to 2023
Financial Services Operations
​
​
Average wholesale receivables increased 26 percent driven by higher dealer used inventory levels. While new retail note volumes moderated due to reduced retail demand, average retail portfolio levels grew due to higher volumes in recent years resulting in a 9 percent increase. Revenue also increased due to higher average financing rates. Excluding the impact of a one-time correction of the accounting treatment for financing incentives offered to John Deere dealers in 2023 (see Note 4), net income declined as a result of a higher provision for credit losses and less-favorable financing spreads driven primarily by the receivable portfolio mix. These factors were partially offset by income earned on higher average portfolio balances.

We have access to global markets at a reasonable cost. Sources of liquidity include:
We closely monitor our cash requirements. Based on the available sources of liquidity, we expect to meet our funding needs in the short term (next 12 months) and long term (beyond 12 months). We are forecasting lower operating cash flows from equipment operations in 2025 compared with 2024 driven by a decrease in net income adjusted for non-cash provisions, partially offset by higher cash flows generated from inventory reductions.
We operate in multiple industries, which have unique funding requirements. The equipment operations are capital intensive. Historically, these operations have been subject to seasonal variations in financing requirements for inventories and receivables from dealers. The financial services operations rely on their ability to raise substantial amounts of funds to finance their receivable and lease portfolios.
The assets and liabilities of Banco John Deere S.A. (BJD) were reclassified to held for sale in the third quarter of 2024 and are therefore not included within the 2024 balances reflected below (see Note 4).

Cash inflows from operating activities were $9.2 billion in 2024, driven by net income adjusted for non-cash provisions and lower inventories and receivables from a decline in sales. These items were partially offset by a decrease in vendor payables and a reduction in dealer sales incentive accruals.
Cash
outflows from investing activities were $6.5 billion in 2024 due to growth in the financing receivable and lease portfolios and capital expenditures.
Cash outflows from financing activities were $2.7 billion in 2024, as repurchases of common stock and dividends paid were partially offset by higher borrowings.
Cash Returned to Shareholders
Cash returned to shareholders decreased $3.0 billion in 2024 as we managed cash flows through the declining business cycle in accordance with our use-of-cash priorities.
To access public debt capital markets, we rely on credit rating agencies to assign short-term and long-term credit ratings to our debt securities as an indicator of credit quality for fixed income investors.
A security rating is not a recommendation by the rating agency to buy, sell, or hold our securities. A credit rating agency may change or withdraw ratings based on its assessment of our current and future ability to meet interest and principal repayment obligations. Each agency’s rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Lower credit ratings generally
result in higher borrowing costs, including costs of derivative transactions, reduced access to debt capital markets, and may adversely impact our liquidity.
The senior long-term and short-term debt ratings and outlook currently assigned to unsecured company securities by the rating agencies engaged by us are as follows:
​
​
​
Our material cash requirements include the following:
Borrowings
– As of October 27, 2024, we had $17.6 billion of payments due on borrowings and securitization borrowings in the next year, along with interest payments of $2.5 billion. The securitization borrowing payments are based on the expected liquidation of the retail notes. See Notes 12 and 19 for additional borrowing details. These payments will likely be replaced with new borrowings to finance the receivable and lease portfolio, which is expected to be lower in 2025.
Purchase Obligations
– As of October 27, 2024, our outstanding purchase obligations were $3.2 billion, with $2.8 billion payable within one year. These purchase obligations are noncancelable.
Other Cash Requirements
–
In addition to our contractual obligations, we have the following commitments:
Share repurchases will be considered as a means of deploying excess cash to shareholders, once the previously mentioned requirements are met.
The timely preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions. Those estimates affect reported amounts in these financial statements. Changes in those estimates and assumptions could have a significant effect. The following estimates are the most critical to our financial statements:
34
Table of Contents
​
These items require the most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments. Our accounting policies are described primarily in Note 2 of our consolidated financial statements.
Sales Incentives
We provide sales incentives to dealers. These incentives are offered in two forms:
The estimated cost of these programs is based on:
At the time a sale is recognized, we record an estimate of the sales incentive costs. The final cost is determined at the end of the volume bonus measurement period or at the time of the retail sale.
There are numerous programs available at any time, and new programs may be announced after we record the equipment sale to the dealer. Changes in the mix and types of sales incentive programs affect these estimates, which are reviewed quarterly.
Actual cost differences from the original cost estimate are recognized in “Net sales.”
Sales Incentive Accruals
The accruals recorded against receivables relate to programs where we have the contractual right and the intent to offset against existing receivables. The decrease in 2024 resulted from lower sales.
A key assumption of the retail sales incentive accrual is the predictive value of the historical percent of retail sales incentive costs to retail sales. Over the last five fiscal years, this percent has varied by an average of 1.0 percent. Holding other assumptions constant, a 1.0 percent change would have modified the sales incentive accrual by about $135.
​
Product Warranties
A standard warranty is provided as an assurance that our equipment will function as intended. The standard warranty period varies by product and region.
At the time a sale is recognized, we record an estimate of future warranty costs, based on the following calculation:
The historical claims rate is determined by a review of five-year claims costs. The estimated population is based on dealer inventories and retail sales. These estimates are reviewed quarterly. Adjustments are also made for current quality developments.
Product Warranty Accruals
The decrease in 2024 is the result of lower sales volumes.
Product warranty accrual estimates are affected by the historical percent of warranty claims costs as a percentage of gross sales. Over the last five fiscal years, the percent has varied plus or minus .09 percent. Holding all other assumptions constant, if this estimated cost experience percent would have increased or decreased .09 percent, the warranty accrual at October 27, 2024 would have changed by approximately $50.
Postretirement Benefit Obligations
The pension and OPEB plan obligations (defined benefit) and expenses require the use of estimates. The main estimate is the present value of the projected future benefit payments. These future benefit payments extend several decades.
The estimates are based on existing retirement plan provisions. No assumption is made regarding any potential changes to benefit provisions beyond those to which we are presently committed (e.g., in existing labor contracts).
The key assumptions used by our actuaries to calculate the estimates include:
Assumptions are set each year-end. These assumptions are not changed during the year unless there is a significant plan event. Actual results that differ from the assumptions affect future expenses and obligations.
35
Table of Contents
​
The key pension and OPEB amounts follow:
​
​
​
The increase in the 2024 pension and OPEB net benefit was due to an increase in the expected long-term rates of return on pension plan assets and the Canadian pension settlement charge recognized in 2023 (see Note 7).
The effect of hypothetical changes to selected assumptions on our major U.S. retirement benefit plans would be as follows:
​
*
Projected benefit obligation (PBO) for pension plans and accumulated postretirement benefit obligation (APBO) for OPEB plans.
**
Pretax impact on service cost, interest cost, and amortization of gains or losses.
​
Allowance for Credit Losses
The allowance for credit losses is an estimate of the credit losses expected over the life of the receivable portfolio. The allowance is measured on a collective basis for receivables with similar risk characteristics. Receivables that do not share risk characteristics are evaluated on an individual basis. Risk characteristics include:
We utilize the following loss forecast models to estimate expected credit losses:
Management reviews each model’s output quarterly, and qualitative adjustments are incorporated as necessary to arrive at management’s best estimate of expected credit losses.
Allowance for Credit Losses
During 2024, we determined that the financial services business in Brazil met the held for sale criteria. The receivables in Brazil were reclassified to “Assets held for sale.” The associated allowance for credit losses was reversed and a valuation allowance for the assets held for sale was recorded (see Note 4). Excluding the business in Brazil, the allowance for credit losses increased, primarily due to higher expected losses as a result of elevated delinquencies and a decline in market conditions. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in the allowance on revolving charge accounts, driven by write-offs of seasonal financing program accounts and recoveries expected on those accounts in the future.
While we believe our allowance is sufficient to provide for losses over the life of our existing receivable portfolio, different assumptions would result in changes to the allowance for credit losses. Within the retail customer receivable portfolio, credit loss estimates are dependent on a number of factors, including credit quality at time of application, remaining account balances, current delinquency levels, various economic factors, and estimated recoveries on defaulted accounts. Changes in any of these factors could impact our credit losses. Conversely, changes in economic conditions have historically had limited impact on credit losses within the wholesale receivable portfolio.
Holding all other factors constant, a 10 percent increase in the linear regression models’ forecasted defaults and a simultaneous 10 percent decrease in recovery rates would have resulted in a $70 increase to the allowance for credit losses at October 27, 2024.
Operating Lease Residual Values
Equipment on operating leases is depreciated to the estimated residual value over the lease term. The residual values are based on several factors, including:
36
Table of Contents
​
We review residual value estimates during the lease term. Depreciation is adjusted over the remaining lease term if residual estimates are revised. Impairments are recorded when events or circumstances necessitate.
At the end of the majority of leases, the equipment is disposed in the following sequence:
Operating Lease Residual Values
Hypothetically, if (a) future market values for this equipment were to decrease 10 percent from our present estimates, and (b) all the equipment on operating leases were returned to us for remarketing at the end of the lease term, the total unfavorable impact after consideration of dealer residual value guarantees would be approximately $75. This amount would be recognized as higher depreciation expense over the remaining term of the operating leases, or potentially as an impairment.
Income Taxes
We are subject to federal, state, and foreign income taxes. These tax laws can be complex. Significant judgment and interpretation is required to implement them. Changes in tax laws could materially affect our consolidated financial statements. We record our tax positions in the following categories:
Deferred income taxes represent temporary differences between the tax and the financial reporting basis of assets and liabilities. This will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future. Loss carryforwards and tax credits are significant components of deferred tax asset balances. These assets are reviewed regularly for the following:
Valuation allowances are established when we determine that the deferred tax benefit may not be realized. The recoverability
analysis requires significant judgment and relies on estimates. The valuation allowance as of October 27, 2024 was $1.6 billion. Changes in foreign income tax laws, income for certain jurisdictions, or our tax structure could impact the valuation allowance balance.
Some tax positions contain significant uncertainties. These positions may be challenged or disallowed by taxing authorities. If it is likely the position will be disallowed, no tax benefit is recorded. If it is likely the position will be sustained, a tax benefit is recognized. The ultimate resolution could take many years. This may result in a payment that is significantly different from the original estimate.
See Note 8 for further information on income taxes.
FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
Certain statements contained herein, including in the section entitled “Overview” relating to future events, expectations, and trends constitute “forward-looking statements” as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and involve factors that are subject to change, assumptions, risks, and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Some of these risks and uncertainties could affect all lines of our operations generally while others could more heavily affect a particular line of business.
Forward-looking statements are based on currently available information and current assumptions, expectations, and projections about future events and should not be relied upon. Except as required by law, we expressly disclaim any obligation to update or revise our forward-looking statements. Many factors, risks, and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements. Among these factors are risks related to:

SUPPLEMENTAL CONSOLIDATING DATA
The supplemental consolidating data presented on the subsequent pages is presented for informational purposes. Equipment operations represent the enterprise without financial services. Equipment operations include production and precision agriculture operations, small agriculture and turf operations, construction and forestry operations, and other corporate assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses not reflected within financial services. Transactions between the equipment operations and financial services have been eliminated to arrive at the consolidated financial statements.
Equipment operations and financial services participate in different industries. Equipment operations primarily generate earnings and cash flows by manufacturing and selling equipment, service parts, and technology solutions to dealers and retail customers. Financial services finance sales and leases by dealers of new and used equipment that is largely manufactured by equipment operations. Those earnings and cash flows generally are the difference between the finance income received from customer payments less interest expense, and depreciation on equipment subject to an operating lease. The two businesses are capitalized differently and have separate performance metrics. The supplemental consolidating data is also used by management due to these differences.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT MARKET RISK INFORMATION
We are naturally exposed to various interest rate and foreign currency risks. As a result, we enter into derivative transactions to manage this exposure and not for speculative purposes.
From time to time, we enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage our interest rate exposure. We also have foreign currency exposures at some of our foreign and domestic operations related to buying, selling, and financing in currencies other than the functional currencies. We have entered into derivative agreements related to the management of these foreign currency transaction risks.
Interest Rate Risk
Results of Operations
– Central bank policy rates increased in 2022 and 2023 and have remained elevated. Increased rates impacted us in several ways, primarily affecting the demand for our products and financing spreads for the financial services operations. Increased interest rates have historically impacted our borrowings sooner than the benefit is realized from the financing receivable and equipment on operating lease portfolios.
Fair Value Measurement
– Quarterly, we use a combination of cash flow models to assess the sensitivity of our financial instruments with interest rate exposure to changes in market interest rates. The models calculate the effect of adjusting interest rates as follows:
The net impact in these financial instruments’ fair values which would be caused by decreasing or increasing the interest rates by 10 percent from the market rates at October 27, 2024, and October 29, 2023, would have been approximately $75 and $10, respectively.
Reference Rate Reform
– We transitioned our financing, funding, and hedging portfolios from the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) to alternative reference rates in 2023, and in 2024, we transitioned certain portfolios from the Canadian Dollar Offered Rate (CDOR) to an alternative reference rate. These transition activities did not have a material impact on our financial statements.
Foreign Currency Risk
We hedge significant currency exposures for our equipment operations. Worldwide foreign currency exposures are reviewed quarterly. Based on the anticipated and committed foreign currency cash inflows, outflows, and hedging policy for the next twelve months, we estimate that a hypothetical 10 percent strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies through 2025 would increase the 2025 expected net cash inflows by approximately $25. At October 29, 2023, a hypothetical 10 percent strengthening of the U.S. dollar under similar assumptions and calculations indicated a potential $25 increase on the 2024 net cash inflows. The estimated impacts on net cash inflows by currency follow:
​
​
In the financial services operations, our policy is to manage foreign currency risk through hedging strategies if the currency of the borrowings does not match the currency of the receivable portfolio. As a result, a hypothetical 10 percent adverse change in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to all other foreign currencies would not have a material effect on the financial services cash flows.

​
1. ORGANIZATION AND CONSOLIDATION
References to “Deere & Company,” “John Deere,” “Deere,” “we,” “us,” or “our” include our consolidated subsidiaries, unless otherwise stated. We manage our business through the following operating segments: production and precision agriculture (PPA), small agriculture and turf (SAT), construction and forestry (CF), and financial services (John Deere Financial or FS). References to “equipment operations” include PPA, SAT, and CF, while references to “agriculture and turf” include both PPA and SAT.
Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements represent the consolidation of all companies in which Deere & Company has a controlling interest. Certain variable interest entities (VIEs) are consolidated since we are the primary beneficiary. The primary beneficiary has both the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the VIEs’ economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIEs. We consolidate certain VIEs related to retail note securitizations (see Note 12).
We record our investment in each unconsolidated affiliated company (20 to 50 percent ownership) at cost, plus or minus our share of the profit or loss after acquisition, and further reduced for any dividends. Other investments (less than 20 percent ownership) are recorded at cost.
​
Fiscal Year
We use a 52/53 week fiscal year ending on the last Sunday in the reporting period, which generally occurs near the end of October. An additional week is included in the fourth fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign our fiscal quarters with the calendar. The fiscal year ends for 2024, 2023, and 2022 were October 27, 2024, October 29, 2023, and October 30, 2022, respectively. Fiscal years 2024, 2023, and 2022 contained
52
weeks. Unless otherwise stated, references to particular years, quarters, or months refer to our fiscal years and the associated periods in those fiscal years.
Presentation of Amounts
All amounts are presented in millions of dollars, unless otherwise specified. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current period presentation.
Argentina
We have equipment operations and financial services operations in Argentina. The U.S. dollar has historically been the functional currency for our Argentina operations, as our business is indexed to the U.S. dollar due to the highly inflationary conditions. Argentine peso-denominated monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured at each balance sheet date using the official currency exchange rate. The Argentine government has certain capital and currency controls that restrict our ability to access U.S. dollars in Argentina and remit earnings from our Argentine operations. As of October 27, 2024 and October 29, 2023, our net investment in Argentina was $
826
and $
766
, respectively. Net sales and revenues from our Argentine operations represented approximately
1
percent of consolidated net sales and revenues for 2024, 2023, and 2022. We have employed mechanisms to convert Argentine pesos into U.S. dollars to the extent possible. These mechanisms are short-term in nature, leaving us exposed to long-term currency fluctuations. As of October 27, 2024 and October 29, 2023, the gross peso exposure was $
69
and $
30
, respectively, while the net peso exposure (after considering the impact of short-term hedges) was $
14
and $
5
, respectively. In 2024, we invested in U.S. dollar denominated bonds issued by the central bank of Argentina. The bonds are recorded in “Marketable securities” and classified as “International debt securities.” These bonds can be held until maturity or sold in secondary markets outside of Argentina to settle intercompany debt.
2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
The following are significant accounting policies in addition to those included in other notes to the consolidated financial statements.
Use of Estimates in Financial Statements
Certain accounting policies require management to make estimates and assumptions in determining the amounts reflected in the financial statements and related disclosures. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
49
Table of Contents
​
Revenue Recognition
General
Sales of equipment and service parts are recognized when we transfer control of the good to the independent customer, which generally occurs upon shipment. In most situations, the independent customer is a dealer, which subsequently sells the equipment and service parts purchased from us to a retail customer, who can finance the equipment with the financial services segment or another source of financing. In some situations, we sell directly to a retail customer. The term “customer” includes both dealers and retail customers to whom we make direct sales.
Interest-Free Periods and Past-Due Interest
We charge dealers interest on outstanding balances from the earlier of when goods are sold to a retail customer by the dealer or the expiration of the interest-free period granted at the time of the sale to the dealer. Interest-free periods are determined based on the type of equipment sold and the time of year of the sale. These periods range from
one
to
twelve months
for most equipment. Interest-free periods may not be extended. Interest charged may not be forgiven, and past due interest rates are charged at higher rates. If the interest-free or below market interest rate period exceeds one year, we adjust the expected sales revenue for the effects of the time value of money using a current market interest rate. The revenue related to the financing component is recognized in “Finance and interest income” using the interest method. We do not adjust the sales price to account for a financing component if the expected interest-free or below market period is
one
year or less.
Right of Return
Generally, no right of return exists on sales of equipment. Dealers cannot cancel purchases after we recognize a sale and are responsible for payment even if the equipment is not sold to a retail customer. Service parts and certain attachment returns are estimable and accrued at the time a sale is recognized. The estimated returns are based on historical return rates, current dealer inventory levels, and current economic conditions. The estimated returns are recorded in “Other assets” for the inventory value of estimated returns, adjusted for restocking fees. The estimated dealer refund liability, adjusted for restocking fees, is recorded in “Accounts payable and accrued expenses.”
Remanufacturing
We remanufacture used engines and components (cores) that are sold to dealers and retail customers for maintenance and repair parts. Revenue for remanufactured components is recognized using the same criteria as other parts sales. When a remanufactured part is sold, we collect a deposit that is repaid if the customer returns a core that meets certain specifications within a defined time period. The deposit received from the customer is recognized as a liability in “Accounts payable and accrued expenses” and the used component that is expected to be returned is recognized in “Other assets.” When a customer returns a core, the deposit is repaid, the liability reversed, and the returned core is recorded in inventory to be remanufactured and sold to
another customer. If a core is not returned within the required time, the deposit is recognized as revenue in “Net sales,” and the cost of the core is recorded as an expense in “Cost of sales.”
Bundled Technology
Certain equipment is sold with precision guidance, telematics, and other information gathering and analyzing capabilities. These technology solutions require hardware, software, and may include an obligation to provide services for a period of time. These solutions are mostly bundled with the sale of the equipment but can also be purchased or renewed separately. The revenue related to the hardware and embedded software is recognized at the time of the equipment sale and recorded in “Net sales.” The revenue for the future services and usage-based software is deferred and recognized over the service period. The deferred revenue is recorded as a contract liability in “Accounts payable and accrued expenses.”
Financing Revenue and Origination Costs
Financing revenue and deferred costs on the origination of financing receivables are recorded over the lives of the related receivables using the interest method. Deferred costs are recognized as a reduction to “Finance and interest income.” Income and deferred costs on the origination of operating leases are recognized on a straight-line basis over the scheduled lease terms in “Finance and interest income.”
Sales Incentives
We offer sales incentive programs to promote the sale of our products from the dealer to the retail customer. At the time of the sale to a dealer, we record an estimated cost for the sales incentive programs as a reduction to the sales price. The estimated cost is based on historical data, announced and expected incentive programs, field inventory levels, and forecasted sales volumes. The final cost of these programs is determined at the end of the measurement period for volume-based incentives or when the dealer sells the equipment to a retail customer. One type of sales incentive program offered to dealers is pool funds in which we award dealers funds based on new equipment sales. Dealers can use these funds to incentivize sales from the dealer to the end customer. Pool funds, as well as some other incentive programs, are recorded in “Trade accounts and notes receivable – net” as we have the contractual right and the intent to offset against the existing dealer receivables. Actual cost differences from the original cost estimate are recognized in “Net sales.”
Product Warranties
For equipment and service parts sales, we provide a standard warranty. At the time a sale is recognized, the estimated future warranty costs are recorded. The warranty liability is estimated based on historical warranty claims rate experience and the estimated amount of equipment still under warranty. The historical claims rate is primarily determined by a review of
five-year
claims costs while also taking into consideration current quality developments. The amount of equipment still under warranty is estimated based on dealer inventories and retail sales.
50
Table of Contents
​
We also offer extended warranty arrangements for purchase at the customer’s option. The premiums for extended warranties are recognized in “Other income” primarily in proportion to the costs expected to be incurred over the contract period. The unamortized extended warranty premiums (deferred revenue) are recorded in “Accounts payable and accrued expenses” (see Note 18).
Sales and Transaction Taxes
We collect and remit taxes for revenue producing transactions as necessary based on various tax laws. These taxes include sales, use, value-added, and some excise taxes. We elected to exclude these taxes from the determination of the sales price. These taxes are not included in revenues.
Contract Costs
Incremental costs of obtaining an equipment revenue contract are recognized as an expense when incurred since the amortization period would be
one
year or less.
Advertising Costs
Advertising costs are charged to “Selling, administrative and general expenses” as incurred. Advertising costs were $
230
in 2024, $
244
in 2023, and $
227
in 2022.
Depreciation and Amortization
Property and equipment, capitalized software, and other intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation or amortization. These assets are depreciated over their estimated useful lives using the straight-line method. Equipment on operating leases is depreciated over the terms of the leases using the straight-line method. Property and equipment expenditures for new and revised products, increased capacity, and the replacement or major renewal of significant items are capitalized. Expenditures for maintenance, repairs, and minor renewals are charged to expense as incurred.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
We consider investments with purchased maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
Receivables and Allowances
All financing and trade receivables are reported on the balance sheet at outstanding principal and accrued interest, adjusted for:
The allowance is a reduction to the receivable balances, and the provision is recorded in “Selling, administrative and general expenses.” The allowance for credit losses is an estimate of the credit losses expected over the life of our receivable portfolio. Non-performing receivables are included in the estimate of expected credit losses. The allowance is measured on a collective basis for receivables with similar risk characteristics. Receivables that do not share risk characteristics are evaluated on an individual basis. Risk characteristics include:
​
We utilize the following loss forecast models to estimate expected credit losses:
Management reviews each model’s output quarterly, and qualitative adjustments are incorporated as necessary (see Note 11).
Long-Lived Assets, Goodwill, and Other Intangible Asset Impairment
We evaluate the carrying value of long-lived assets (including equipment on operating leases, property and equipment, goodwill, and other intangible assets) when events or circumstances warrant such a review. Goodwill and unamortized intangible assets are tested for impairment annually at the end of the third quarter of each fiscal year, and more often if events or circumstances may have caused the fair value to fall below the carrying value. If the carrying value of the long-lived asset is considered impaired, the long-lived asset is written down to its fair value (see Notes 4 and 25).
Goodwill is allocated and reviewed for impairment by reporting unit. Goodwill is allocated to the reporting unit in which the business that created the goodwill resides. To test for goodwill impairment, the carrying value of each reporting unit is compared with its fair value. If the carrying value of the goodwill is considered impaired, the impairment is measured as the reporting unit’s carrying value minus the fair value.

Derivative Financial Instruments
It is our policy to use derivative transactions only to manage exposures from the normal course of business. We do not execute derivative transactions for the purpose of creating speculative positions or trading. Our financial services operations have interest rate and foreign currency exposure between (a) the receivable or lease portfolio and (b) how those portfolios are funded. We also have foreign currency exposures at some of our foreign and domestic operations related to buying, selling, and financing in currencies other than the functional currencies. In addition, we have interest rate and foreign currency exposure at certain equipment operations units for sales incentive programs.
All derivatives are recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets. Cash collateral received or paid is not offset against the derivative fair values on the balance sheets. The cash flows from the derivative contracts are recorded in operating activities in the statements of consolidated cash flows. Each derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge, fair value hedge, or remains undesignated.
Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded as follows:
All designated hedges are formally documented as to the relationship with the hedged item as well as the risk-management strategy. Both at inception and on an ongoing basis, the hedging instrument is assessed for its effectiveness. If and when a derivative is determined not to be highly effective as a hedge, the underlying hedged transaction is no longer likely to occur, the hedge designation is removed, or the derivative is terminated, hedge accounting is discontinued (see Note 26).
Foreign Currency Translation
The functional currencies for most of our foreign operations are their respective local currencies. The assets and liabilities of these operations are translated into U.S. dollars using the exchange rates at the end of the period. The revenues and expenses are translated at weighted-average rates for the period. The gains or losses from these translations are recorded in OCI.
Foreign currency gains or losses and foreign exchange components of derivative contracts are included in net income, with trade flow activity recorded in “Cost of sales,” sales incentive activity recorded in “Net sales,” and all other activity recorded in “Other operating expenses.” The pretax net loss for foreign exchange in 2024, 2023, and 2022 was $
63
, $
159
, and $
175
, respectively.
​
New Accounting Pronouncements Adopted
We closely monitor all Accounting Standard Updates (ASUs) issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) and other authoritative guidance. We adopted the following standards in 2024, none of which had a material effect on our consolidated financial statements:

3. ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITION
S
During the presented periods, we completed acquisitions to support our Smart Industrial Operating Model and Leap Ambitions, which focus on advancing our capabilities in technology.
Acquisitions
2023 Acquisitions
In 2023, we acquired SparkAI Inc. (Spark AI) and Smart Apply, Inc. (Smart Apply) to accelerate the integration of smart technology innovation in our products. The combined cost of these acquisitions was
$
82
, net of cash acquired of
$
2
. Spark AI was assigned to the PPA segment, while Smart Apply was assigned to the SAT segment. Most of the purchase price for these acquisitions was allocated to goodwill.
2022 Acquisitions
Kreisel
In February 2022, we acquired majority ownership in Kreisel Electric Inc. (Kreisel), a pioneer in the development of immersion-cooled battery technology. The Austrian company manufactures high-density, high-durability electric battery modules and packs for high-performance and off-highway applications and has created a battery-buffered, high-powered charging infrastructure platform.
The transaction includes a call option to purchase the remaining ownership interest in Kreisel in 2027. The minority interest holders also have a put option that would require us to purchase the holders’ ownership interests in 2027. The put and call options cannot be separated from the noncontrolling interest. Due to the redemption features, the minority interest is classified as redeemable noncontrolling interest in our consolidated balance sheets.
The total cash purchase price was
$
276
, consisting of
$
253
for the acquired equity interests,
$
21
to reduce the option price, and customary working capital adjustments, net of cash acquired.
The fair values assigned to the assets and liabilities of the acquired entity, which are based on information as of the acquisition date and available at October 30, 2022, follows:
​
​
The identifiable intangible assets were related to technology, trade name, and customer relationships with a weighted average amortization period of
12 years
. The goodwill is not deductible for income tax purposes. Kreisel is allocated amongst the PPA, SAT, and CF segments.
​
Excavator Factories
In March 2022, we acquired full ownership of three former Deere-Hitachi joint venture factories and began new license and supply agreements with Hitachi Construction Machinery Co., Ltd. (Hitachi). The two companies also ended their joint venture manufacturing and marketing agreements. The former joint venture factories continue to manufacture Deere-branded construction excavators and forestry equipment. Through a new supply agreement with Hitachi, Deere continues to offer a full portfolio of excavators. Deere’s marketing arrangement for Hitachi-branded construction excavators and mining equipment in the Americas ended with Hitachi assuming distribution and support of these products. John Deere dealers may continue to support their existing field population of Hitachi-branded excavators.
With the completion of this acquisition, we now have complete control over the excavator design, product, and feature updates, making it possible to more rapidly respond to customer requirements and integrate excavators with other construction products in the John Deere product portfolio. We can leverage technology developed for other product lines and production systems across the enterprise and extend those advanced solutions to Deere-designed excavators, strengthening the entire product portfolio.
The total invested capital was as follows:
​
​
The total purchase price consideration includes deferred consideration that will be paid as we purchase Deere-branded excavators, components, and service parts from Hitachi under the new supply agreement with a duration that ranges from
5
to
30 years
. The deferred consideration represents the price increases under the new supply arrangement. See Note 25 for fair value measurement information. Excluding inflation adjustments, the price increases for products to be acquired by us from Hitachi are as much as
27
percent higher than the prior supply arrangement. We financed the acquisition and associated transaction expenses from cash on hand. The fair value of the previously held equity investment created a non-cash
gain
of
$
326
(pretax and after-tax), which was recorded in “Other income” and included in the CF segment’s operating profit.
Prior to the acquisition, we purchased Deere- and Hitachi-branded excavators, components, and parts from the Deere-Hitachi joint venture factories for sale to John Deere dealers. These purchases were included in “Cost of sales,” while the sales to John Deere dealers were included in “Net sales.” Cost of sales also included profit-sharing payments to Hitachi in accordance with the previous
53
Table of Contents
​
marketing agreements. Following the acquisition, Net sales only includes the sale of Deere-branded excavators to John Deere dealers, while Cost of sales reflects market pricing to purchase and manufacture excavators, as well as the related components and service parts.
The fair values assigned to the assets and liabilities of the acquired factories, which are based on information as of the acquisition date and available at October 30, 2022, follow:
​
​
The identifiable intangible assets were related to technology with a
10-year
amortization period. The goodwill is not deductible for income tax purposes. The excavator factories are reported in the CF segment.
Other Acquisitions
In 2022, we acquired AgriSync Inc. (AgriSync), a technology service provider; an
80
percent stake in both SureFire Ag Systems, Inc. and SureFire Electronics, LLC, renamed after acquisition and collectively referred to as SurePoint Ag Systems, Inc. (SurePoint), which design and manufacture liquid fertilizer application and spray tendering systems; an equity method investment in GUSS Automation LLC (GUSS Automation), a pioneer in semi-autonomous orchard and vineyard sprayers; LGT, LLC (Light), which specializes in depth sensing and camera-based perception for autonomous vehicles; and an equity method investment in InnerPlant, Inc. (InnerPlant), an early-stage biotech company. The combined cost of these acquisitions was
$
134
, net of cash acquired of
$
3
.
The asset and liability fair values at the respective acquisition dates follow:
​
​
​
The identifiable intangible assets were related to trade name, technology, and customer relationships with a weighted average amortization period of
7 years
. AgriSync was allocated amongst the PPA, SAT, and CF segments, while SurePoint, Light, and InnerPlant were allocated to the PPA segment. GUSS Automation was assigned to the SAT segment.
Dispositions
In October 2023, we sold our roadbuilding business in Russia. At the time of the sale, total assets were
$
32
, consisting primarily of restricted cash, total liabilities were
$
1
, and the cumulative translation loss was
$
11
. Total proceeds from the sale include
$
16
of cash and
$
8
of deferred consideration. A
pretax
and after-tax loss of
$
18
was recorded in “
Other operating expenses
” in the CF segment. As of October 27, 2024, our remaining investments in Russia were not material.
In March 2023, we sold our financial services business in Russia (registered in Russia as a leasing company) to Insight Investment Group. The total proceeds, net of restricted cash sold, were
$
36
. The operations were included in the financial services operating segment through the date of sale. At the disposal date, the total assets were
$
31
, consisting primarily of financing receivables, the total liabilities were
$
5
, and the cumulative translation loss was
$
10
. In the first quarter of 2023, we reversed the allowance for credit losses and recorded a valuation allowance on the assets held for sale in “Selling, administrative and general expenses.” We did not incur additional gains or losses upon disposition.
​
4. SPECIAL ITEMS
We were impacted by the following items.
2024 Special Items
Legal Settlements
In 2024, we reached legal settlements concerning patent infringement claims. As a result of these settlements, we recognized a total of
$
57
pretax gain (
$
45
after-tax) in "Other income," providing a benefit of
$
17
to PPA and
$
40
to CF. These settlements resolve the disputes without any admission of liability by the parties involved. We believe that these settlements enhance our ability to protect our intellectual property and reinforce our commitment to innovation and technological advancement.
Impairment
In the fourth quarter of 2024, we recorded a non-cash charge of
$
28
pretax and
after-tax
in “Equity in income (loss) of unconsolidated affiliates” for an other than temporary decline in value of an investment recorded in SAT. See Note 25 for fair value measurement information.
Employee-Separation Programs
In the third quarter of 2024, we implemented employee-separation programs for our salaried workforce in several geographic areas, including the United States, Europe, Asia, and Latin America. The programs’ main purpose was to help meet our strategic priorities while reducing overlap and redundancy in roles and responsibilities. The programs were largely involuntary in
54
Table of Contents
​
nature with the expense recorded when management committed to a plan, the plan was communicated to the employees, and the employees were not required to provide service beyond the legal notification period. For the limited voluntary employee-separation programs, the expense was recorded in the period in which the employee irrevocably accepted a separation offer.
The programs’ total pretax expenses are estimated to be approximately
$
165
. In 2024, we recorded
$
157
pretax expenses (
$
124
after-tax) related to the programs, of which
$
130
was paid in 2024 and
$
27
is expected to be paid in 2025
. The remaining expenses are associated with programs in international locations and are expected to be recorded in 2025.
The programs’ pretax expenses in 2024 were as follows:
​
*    Relates primarily to corporate expenses.
​
Banco John Deere S.A.
In August 2024, we entered into a joint venture agreement with a Brazilian bank, Banco Bradesco S.A. (Bradesco), for Bradesco to invest and become
50
percent owner of our wholly-owned subsidiary in Brazil, Banco John Deere S.A. (BJD). BJD is included in our financial services segment and finances retail and wholesale loans for agricultural, construction, and forestry equipment. The transaction is intended to reduce our incremental risk as we continue to grow in the Brazilian market. On the transaction date, which is expected to occur in the first half of 2025, Bradesco will contribute capital equal to our equity investment in BJD. We will retain a
50
percent equity interest in BJD and expect to report the results of the joint venture as an equity investment in unconsolidated affiliates.
The BJD business was reclassified as held for sale in the third quarter of 2024, as the held for sale criteria was met. A reversal of
$
38
in allowance for credit losses was recorded in the third quarter. At October 27, 2024, a
$
97
valuation allowance was recorded on the assets held for sale, which was presented in “Impairments and other adjustments” in the statements of consolidated cash flows. The net impact of these entries was a pretax and
after-tax
loss of
$
59
recorded in “
Selling, administrative and general expenses
.”
​
The major classes of the total consolidated assets and liabilities of BJD classified as held for sale and liabilities of BJD to other intercompany parties at October 27, 2024 follows. See Note 25 for fair value measurement information.
​
*
Includes
$
1
restricted cash balance.
​
Redeemable Noncontrolling Interest
In the third quarter of 2024, we exercised our right to purchase the remaining
20
percent interest in SurePoint. The arrangement was accounted for as an equity transaction with
no
gain or loss recorded in the statements of consolidated income.
2023 Special Items
Sale of Russian Roadbuilding Business
In
October 2023, we sold our Russian roadbuilding business, recognizing a loss of
$
18
(
pretax
and after-tax). The loss was recorded in “
Other operating expenses
” in the construction and forestry operations.
Brazil Tax Ruling
In
the third quarter of 2023, the Brazil Superior Court of Justice published a favorable tax ruling regarding taxability of local incentives, which allowed us to record a
$
243
reduction in the provision for income taxes and
$
47
of
interest income.
Financial Services Financing Incentives Correction
In
the second quarter of 2023, we corrected the accounting treatment for financing incentives offered to John Deere dealers, which impacted the timing of expense recognition and the presentation of incentive costs in the consolidated financial statements. The cumulative effect of this correction,
$
173
pretax (
$
135
after-tax), was recorded in “Selling, administrative and general expenses” in the second quarter of
2023
. Prior period results for Deere & Company were not restated, as the adjustment was considered
immaterial
to our financial statements.

Summary of 2024 and 2023 Special Items
The following table summarizes the operating profit impact of the special items recorded in 2024 and 2023.
​
​
​
2022 Special Items
UAW Collective Bargaining Agreement
In November 2021, employees represented by the International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America (UAW) approved a new collective bargaining agreement. The agreement, which has a term of
six years
, covers the wages, hours, benefits, and other terms and conditions of employment for our UAW-represented employees at
14
U.S. facilities. The labor agreement included a lump sum ratification bonus payment of $
8,500
per eligible employee, totaling $
90
million, and an immediate wage increase of
10
percent plus further wage increases over the term of the contract. The lump sum payment was expensed in the first quarter of 2022.
Impact of Events in Russia / Ukraine
In February 2022, we suspended shipments of machines and service parts to Russia due to the events in Russia / Ukraine. The suspension of shipments reduced the forecasted revenue for the region, which made it probable future cash flows would not cover the carrying value of certain assets. As a result, an impairment was recorded for most long-lived assets in Russia, and our U.S. senior management decided to initiate a voluntary employee-separation program. We also recorded a reserve on inventory, and increased our allowance for credit losses, reflecting economic uncertainty in Russia.
The financial services operations received an intercompany benefit from the equipment operations, which guarantees the financial services’ investments in certain international markets, including Russia.
The Russian government imposed certain restrictions on companies’ abilities to repatriate or remit cash from their Russian-based operations to locations outside of Russia. Cash in excess of what was required to fund operations in Russia was reclassified as restricted.
A summary of the reserves, impairments, and voluntary-separation costs recorded in 2022 follows. See Note 25 for fair value measurement information.
​
​
​
Gain on Previously Held Equity Investment
In March 2022, we acquired full ownership of three former Deere-Hitachi joint venture factories and began new license and supply agreements with Hitachi. The fair value of the previous equity investment resulted in a non-cash gain of $
326
(pretax and
after-tax
; see Note 3).

​
We invoice in advance of recognizing the sale of certain products and the revenue for certain services. These relate to extended warranty premiums, advance payments for future equipment sales, and subscription and service revenue related to precision guidance, telematic services, and other information enabled solutions. These advanced customer payments are presented as deferred revenue, a contract liability, in “Accounts payable and accrued expenses.” The deferred revenue received, but not recognized in revenue was $
1,923
and $
1,697
at October 27, 2024 and October 29, 2023, respectively. The contract liability is reduced as the revenue is recognized. Revenue recognized from deferred revenue that was recorded as a contract liability at the beginning of the fiscal year was $
553
in 2024, $
547
in 2023, and $
609
in 2022.
The amount of unsatisfied performance obligations for contracts with an original duration greater than one year and the estimated revenue to be recognized by fiscal year at October 27, 2024 follows:
​
​
As permitted, we elected only to disclose remaining performance obligations with an original contract duration greater than one year. The contracts with an expected duration of one year or less are for sales to dealers and retail customers for equipment, service parts, repair services, and certain telematics services.
​
6. SUPPLEMENTAL CASH FLOW INFORMATION
All cash flows from receivables related to sales are included in operating activities. This includes all changes in trade accounts and notes receivables, as well as some financing receivables (see Note 11). Financing receivables that are related to loans on equipment sold by independent dealers are included in investing activities.
Our short-term borrowings mature or may require payment within three months or less. During 2024, we issued
$
5.3
billion and retired
$
3.8
billion of retail note securitization borrowings, which are presented in “Net proceeds (payments) in short-term borrowings (original maturities three months or less).”
Cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash recorded in “Assets held for sale” relates to BJD (see Note 4). Restricted cash recorded in “Other assets” relates to securitization of financing receivables (see Note 12) and cash held in Russia.
​
Supplemental cash flow information follows:
​
​
​
​
7. PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS
We have several funded and unfunded defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans cover U.S. employees and certain foreign employees. The measurement date of our plans is October 31.
The funded status as of October 31, 2024 of the significant plans follows:
​
​
The components of net periodic pension and OPEB (benefit) cost excluding the service cost component are included in the line item “Other operating expenses.”
The components of net periodic pension (benefit) cost and the related assumptions consisted of the following:
​
​
During 2024,
curtailment expense
of $
35
was recognized related to U.S. hourly employee layoffs.
The 2025 net periodic pension benefit is expected to increase by
$
100
due to an increase in the expected long-term rates of return on pension plan assets (estimated to be
7.1
percent) and the U.S. hourly pension curtailment recognized in 2024, described above.
58
Table of Contents
​
The components of net periodic OPEB cost and the assumptions related to the cost consisted of the following:
​
​
The benefit plan obligations, funded status, and the assumptions related to the obligations at October 27, 2024 and October 29, 2023 follow:
​
​
​
The actuarial loss for pension for 2024 was due to a decrease in discount rates. The actuarial loss for OPEB for 2024 was due to a decrease in discount rates and changes to health care assumptions. The actuarial gain for pension for 2023 was due to an increase in discount rates. The actuarial gain for OPEB for 2023 was due to changes to health care assumptions.
​
During
2023
, we irrevocably transferred to an insurance company
$
112
of a Canadian pension plan’s defined benefit obligations and related
plan assets
. The transaction resulted in no changes to the benefits to be received by the retired participants. We recognized a one-time, non-cash, pretax pension settlement charge of
$
36
related to the accelerated recognition of actuarial losses included within “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).”
The discount rate assumptions used to determine the pension and OPEB obligations for all periods presented were based on hypothetical AA yield curves represented by a series of annualized individual discount rates. These discount rates represent the rates at which our benefit obligations could effectively be settled at the October 31 measurement dates.
The mortality assumptions for the 2024 U.S. benefit plan obligations used the tables based on the plan’s mortality experience and the most recent scales issued by the Society of Actuaries. The mortality assumptions for the 2023 U.S. benefit plan obligations used the most recent tables and scales issued by the Society of Actuaries at that time. The 2024 and 2023 mortality assumptions included an adjustment to the scale related to COVID for some plans.
The weighted-average annual rates of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits (the health care cost trend rates) for medical and prescription drug claims for pre- and post-65 age groups used to determine the October 27, 2024 and October 29, 2023 accumulated postretirement benefit obligations were as follows:

Actuarial gains and losses are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). To the extent unamortized gains and losses exceed 10 percent of the higher of the market-related value of assets or the benefit obligation, the excess is amortized as a component of net periodic (benefit) cost over the remaining service period of the active participants. For plans in which all or almost all of the plan’s participants are inactive, the amortization period is the remaining life expectancy of the inactive participants.
Contributions
We make any required contributions to the plan assets under applicable regulations and voluntary contributions after evaluating our liquidity position and ability to make tax-deductible contributions. Total contributions to the plans were $
241
in 2024 and $
228
in 2023, which included both required and voluntary contributions and direct benefit payments.
We expect to contribute approximately
$
100
to our pension plans and approximately
$
660
to our OPEB plans in 2025. In November 2024, a committee of our Board of Directors approved a voluntary contribution to a U.S. OPEB plan for up to
$
520
to be made during the first quarter of 2025. This contribution will increase plan assets. The contributions include required and voluntary contributions and direct benefit payments from company funds. We have no significant required contributions to U.S. pension plan assets in 2025 under applicable funding regulations.

Investments at net asset value in the preceding tables are measured at fair value using the net asset value per share practical expedient and are not classified in the fair value hierarchy.
Fair value measurement levels in the preceding tables are defined in Note 25.
Fair values are determined as follows:
Cash and Short-Term Investments –
The investments include (1) cash accounts that are valued based on the account value, which approximates fair value; (2) investments that are valued at quoted prices in the active markets in which the investment trades or using a market approach (matrix pricing model) in which all significant inputs are observable or can be derived from or corroborated by observable market data; and (3) investment funds that are valued based on a constant fund net asset value, which is based on quoted prices in the active market in which the investment fund trades, or the fund’s net asset value using the net asset value per share practical expedient (NAV), which is based on the fair value of the underlying securities.
Equity Securities and Funds
–
The values are determined using quoted prices in the active market in which the equity investment trades, Equity funds are valued using the fund’s NAV, which is based on the fair value of the underlying securities.
Fixed Income Securities and Funds and Other Funds
–
The securities are valued using either a market approach (matrix pricing model) in which all significant inputs are observable or can be derived from or corroborated by observable market data such as interest rates, yield curves, volatilities, credit risk, and prepayment speeds, or they are valued using the quoted prices in the active market in which the fixed income investment trades. Fixed income and other funds are valued using the fund’s NAV, which is based on the fair value of the underlying securities.
61
Table of Contents
​
Real Estate, Venture Capital, Private Equity, and Hedge Funds
–
The investments that are structured as limited partnerships, excluding the private equity investment classified as Level 3, are valued at estimated fair value based on their proportionate share of the limited partnership’s fair value that is determined by the respective general partner. These investments are valued using the fund’s NAV, which is based on the fair value of the underlying investments. Valuations may be lagged up to six months. The NAV is adjusted for cash flows (additional investments or contributions, and distributions) and any known substantive valuation changes through year end. The private equity investment classified as Level 3 was valued based on the market pricing received in October 2023 for the assets that were sold in a secondary sale in December 2023. The investment was transferred into Level 3 as of October 29, 2023.
Derivative Instruments
–
The derivatives are valued using either an income approach (discounted cash flow) using market observable inputs, including swap curves and both forward and spot exchange rates, or a market approach (quoted prices in the active market in which the derivative instrument trades).
The investment objective for the pension and health care plan assets is to fulfill the projected obligations to the beneficiaries over a long period of time, while meeting our fiduciary responsibilities. The asset allocation policy is the most important decision in managing the assets, and it is reviewed regularly. The asset allocation policy considers our long-term asset class risk/return expectations for each plan since the obligations are long-term in nature.
The target asset allocations as of October 27, 2024 are as follows:
​
​
The assets are diversified and are managed by professional investment firms as well as by investment professionals who are company employees. As a result of our diversified investment policy, there were no significant concentrations of risk.
A market related value of plan assets is used to calculate the expected return on assets. The market related value recognizes changes in the fair value of pension plan assets systematically over a
five-year
period. The market related value of the health care plan assets equals fair value.
The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets reflects management’s expectations of long-term average rates of return on funds invested to provide for benefits included in the projected benefit obligations. The expected return is based on the outlook for inflation and for returns in multiple asset classes, while also considering historical returns, asset allocation, and investment strategy. Our approach has emphasized the long-term nature of the return estimate such that the return assumption is not changed significantly unless there are fundamental changes in
capital markets that affect our expectations for returns over an extended period of time (i.e.,
10
to
20 years
).
The average annual return of our U.S. pension fund was approximately
7.2
percent during the past ten years and approximately
8.0
percent during the past 20 years.
We have Voluntary Employees’ Beneficiary Association trusts (VEBAs) for the funding of hourly and salary postretirement health care benefits. The future expected asset returns for the VEBAs are lower than the expected return on the other pension and health care plan assets due to investment in a higher proportion of liquid securities. These assets are in addition to the other postretirement health care plan assets that have been funded under Section 401(h) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code and maintained in a separate account in the John Deere Pension Trust.
Defined Contribution Plans
We have defined contribution plans related to employee investment and savings plans primarily in the U.S. Our contributions and costs under these plans were
$
326
in 2024,
$
288
in 2023, and
$
263
in 2022. The contribution rate varies based on employee participation in the plans.
8. INCOME TAXES
We are subject to income taxes in a number of jurisdictions. We determine our income tax provision using the asset and liability method.
The provision for income taxes by taxing jurisdiction and by significant component consisted of the following:
​
​
Based upon the location of our operations, the consolidated income before income taxes in the U.S. in 2024, 2023, and 2022 was
$
5.9
billion,
$
7.8
billion, and
$
5.0
billion, respectively, and in foreign countries was
$
3.3
billion,
$
5.2
billion, and
$
4.1
billion, respectively. Certain foreign operations are branches or partnerships of Deere & Company and are subject to U.S. as well as foreign income tax regulations. The pretax income by location and the preceding analysis of the income tax provision by taxing jurisdiction are not directly related.

Table of Contents
​
A comparison of the statutory and effective income tax provision and reasons for related differences follow:
​
​
At October 27, 2024, undistributed profits of subsidiaries outside the U.S. of approximately
$
6.0
billion are considered indefinitely reinvested. Determination of the amount of a foreign withholding tax liability on these unremitted earnings is
not practicable
.
Deferred income taxes arise because there are certain items that are treated differently for financial accounting than for income tax reporting purposes.
An analysis of the deferred income tax assets and liabilities at October 27, 2024 and October 29, 2023 follows:
​
​
Deere & Company files a consolidated federal income tax return in the U.S., which includes the wholly-owned financial services subsidiaries. These subsidiaries account for income taxes as if they filed separate income tax returns, with a modification for realizability of certain tax benefits.
At October 27, 2024, tax loss and tax credit carryforwards of
$
1,564
were available with
$
1,063
expiring from 2025 through 2044 and

with an indefinite carryforward period.
​
A reconciliation of unrecognized tax benefits at October 27, 2024, October 29, 2023, and October 30, 2022 follows:
​
​
The amount of unrecognized tax benefits at October 27, 2024 and October 29, 2023 that would impact the effective tax rate if the tax benefits were recognized was
$
410
and
$
329
, respectively. The remaining liability was related to tax positions for which there are offsetting tax receivables, or the uncertainty was only related to timing. We expect that any reasonably possible change in the amounts of unrecognized tax benefits in the next twelve months would not be significant.
We file our tax returns according to the tax laws of the jurisdictions in which we operate, which includes the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions. The U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has completed the examination of our federal income tax returns for periods prior to 2015.
The federal income tax returns for years 2015 to 2020 are currently under examination. Various state and foreign income tax returns also remain subject to examination by taxing authorities

11. RECEIVABLES
Trade Accounts and Notes Receivable
Trade accounts and notes receivable arise from sales of goods and services to customers. See Note 2 for our revenue recognition policy. We evaluate and assess customers creditworthiness on an ongoing basis. Receivables are secured with collateral or other credit enhancements.
Trade accounts and notes receivable at the end of 2024 and 2023 follow:
​
​
These receivables have significant concentrations of credit risk in the agriculture and turf and construction and forestry markets. Credit losses have been historically low. There is not a disproportionate concentration of credit risk with any single customer. On a geographic basis,
51
percent of our trade accounts and notes receivable are located in the U.S. and Canada at October 27, 2024.
At October 27, 2024 and October 29, 2023 trade accounts and notes receivable balances outstanding greater than 12 months were
$
298
and
$
107

​
​
​
*    Individual allowances were not significant.
​
We monitor the economy as part of the allowance setting process, including potential impacts of the agricultural market business cycle and rising interest rates. Adjustments to the allowance are incorporated, as necessary.
During 2024, we determined that the financial services business in Brazil met the held for sale criteria. The receivables in Brazil were reclassified to “Assets held for sale.” The associated allowance for credit losses was reversed and a valuation allowance for the assets held for sale was recorded (see Note 4). The allowance for credit losses on retail notes and financing lease receivables increased in 2024 primarily due to higher expected losses as a result of elevated
67
Table of Contents
​
delinquencies and a decline in market conditions impacting the agriculture receivable portfolio. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in the allowance on revolving charge accounts, driven by write-offs of seasonal financing program accounts and recoveries expected on those accounts in the future.
During 2023, we determined that the financial services business in Russia met the held for sale criteria. The financing receivables in Russia were reclassified to “Other assets” and the associated allowance for credit losses was reversed. These operations were sold in the second quarter of 2023 (see Note 3). Excluding the portfolio in Russia, the allowance increased in 2023, primarily driven by growth in the retail notes and financing lease portfolios and higher expected losses on turf and construction customer accounts.
Write-offs by year of origination were as follows:

​
Financing Receivables – Modifications
We occasionally grant contractual modifications to customers experiencing financial difficulties. Before offering a modification, we evaluate the ability of the customer to meet the modified payment terms. Modifications offered include payment deferrals, term extensions, or a combination thereof. Finance charges continue to accrue during the deferral or extension period with the exception of modifications related to bankruptcy proceedings. Our allowance for credit losses incorporates historical loss information, including the effects of loan modifications with customers. Therefore, additional adjustments to the allowance are generally not recorded upon modification of a loan.
​
At October 27, 2024, the ending amortized cost and performance of modified loans with borrowers experiencing financial difficulty in 2024 was as follows:
​
​
In 2024, these modifications represented
0.18
percent of our financing receivable portfolio. The financial effects of payment deferrals with borrowers experiencing financial difficulty resulted in a weighted average payment deferral of
8 months
to the modified contracts. Term extensions provided to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty added a weighted average of
10 months
to the terms of the modified contracts. Additionally, modifications with a combination of both payment deferrals and term extensions resulted in a weighted average payment deferral of
4 months
and a weighted average term extension of
7 months
.
Defaults and subsequent write-offs of loans modified in the prior twelve months were not significant during 2024. At October 27, 2024, commitments to provide additional financing to these customers were
$

Financing Receivables – Troubled Debt Restructurings
Prior to adopting ASU 2022-02, modifications of loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty were considered troubled debt restructurings when the significant modification of the receivable resulted in a concession we would not otherwise consider.
The following table quantifies troubled debt restructurings:

12. SECURITIZATION OF FINANCING RECEIVABLES
Our funding strategy includes receivable securitizations, which allows us to receive cash for financing receivables immediately. While these securitization programs are administered in various forms, they are accomplished in the following basic steps:
As part of step 1, these receivables are legally isolated from the claims of our general creditors. This ensures cash receipts from the financing receivables are accessible to pay back securitization program investors. The structure of these transactions does not meet the accounting criteria for a sale of receivables. As a result, they are accounted for as a secured borrowing. The receivables and borrowings remain on our balance sheet and are separately reported as “Financing receivables securitized – net” and
“Short-term securitization borrowings,” respectively.
We offer securitization programs to institutional investors and other financial institutions through public issuances or privately through a revolving credit agreement. At October 27, 2024, the revolving agreement had a financing limit of up to
$
2,000
. At October 27, 2024,
$
1,398
of securitization borrowings were outstanding under the revolving agreement. In November 2024, the agreement was renewed for one year with a capacity of
$
2,500
.
Restricted cash held by the SPE serves as a credit enhancement. It would be used to satisfy receivable payment deficiencies, if any. The cash restriction is removed either after all secured borrowing payments are made or proportionally as the secured receivables are collected and the borrowing obligations are reduced.
The components of securitization programs were as follows at the end of 2024 and 2023:
​
​
The weighted-average interest rates on short-term securitization borrowings at October 27, 2024 and October 29, 2023 were
5.0
percent and
4.7
percent, respectively.
Although these securitization borrowings are classified as short-term since payment is required if the financing receivables are liquidated early, the payment schedule for these borrowings at October 27, 2024 based on the expected liquidation of the retail notes is as follows: 2025 –
$
4,036
, 2026 –

We have commitments to extend credit to customers. The commitments are in the form of lines of credit and other pre-approved credit arrangements. We have the right to cancel or amend the terms of these commitments at any time. These commitments are not expected to be fully drawn upon; therefore, the total commitment amounts likely do not represent a future cash requirement. The commitments to extend credit at October 27, 2024 were:
We are subject to various unresolved legal actions. The accrued losses on these matters were not material at October 27, 2024.

The Long-Term Incentive Cash granted to certain employees is accounted for as share-based compensation. This incentive includes a performance metric based, in part, on the price of our shares. We are authorized to grant shares for equity incentive awards. The outstanding shares authorized were
15.0
million at October 27, 2024. We currently use shares that have been repurchased through our stock repurchase programs to satisfy share option exercises and RSU conversions.
The stock awards vesting periods and the dividend equivalents earned during the vesting period follow:
​
​
Stock options expire
ten years
from the grant date. Performance/service-based awards are subject to a performance metric based on our compound annual revenue growth rate, compared to a benchmark group of companies. Market/service-based awards are subject to a market related metric based on total shareholder return, compared to a benchmark group of companies. The performance/service-based units and
market/service
-
based units
award common stock in a range of
zero
to
200
percent for each unit granted based on the level of the metric achieved.
The fair value of stock options and restricted stock units is determined using our closing price on the grant date. The fair value of the market/service-based RSUs is determined using a
Monte Carlo model
. These awards are expensed over the shorter of the award vesting period or the employee’s retirement eligibility period. The performance/service-based units’ expense is adjusted quarterly for the probable number of shares to be awarded. We
recognize the effect of award forfeitures as an adjustment to compensation expense in the period the forfeiture occurs.
The total share-based compensation expense, recognized income tax benefits, and total grant-date fair values of stock options and restricted stock units vested consisted of the following:
​
​
At October 27, 2024, there was $
110
of total unrecognized compensation cost from share-based compensation arrangements. This compensation is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately
1.5
years.
Stock Options
The fair value of each stock option award was estimated on the date of grant using a binomial lattice option valuation model.
The assumptions used for the
binomial lattice model
to determine the fair value of options follow:
​
*    Weighted-averages
​
The risk-free rates are based on U.S. Treasury security yields at the time of grant. Expected volatilities are based on implied volatilities from traded call options on our stock. We use historical data to estimate option exercise behavior representing the weighted-average period that options granted are expected to be outstanding.
The activity for outstanding stock options at October 27, 2024, and changes during 2024 follow:

24. LEASES
We are both a lessee and a lessor. We lease for our own use warehouse facilities, office space, production equipment, information technology equipment, and vehicles. The financial services operations lease equipment produced or sold by us and a limited amount of other equipment to retail customers. We determine if an arrangement is or contains a lease at the contract inception.
Lessee
The amounts of the lease liability and right of use asset are determined at lease commencement and are based on the present value of the lease payments over the lease term. The lease payments are discounted using our incremental borrowing rate since the rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable. We determine the incremental borrowing rate for each lease based on the lease term and the economic environment of the country where the asset will be used, adjusted as if the borrowings were collateralized. Leases with contractual periods greater than one year and that do not meet the finance lease criteria are classified as operating leases.
We have elected to combine lease and nonlease components, such as maintenance and utilities costs included in a lease contract, for all asset classes.
Leases with an initial term of one year or less are expensed on a straight-line basis over the lease term and recorded in short-term lease expense.
Variable lease expense includes warehouse facilities leases with payments based on utilization exceeding contractual minimum amounts and leases with
payments indexed to inflation when the index changes after lease commencement.
The lease expense by type consisted of the following:
​
​
Operating and finance lease right of use assets and lease liabilities follow:

​
Right of use assets obtained in exchange for lease liabilities follow:
​
​
Lessor
We lease equipment manufactured or sold by us through John Deere Financial. Sales-type and direct financing leases are reported in “Financing receivables
‒
net.” Operating leases are reported in “Equipment on operating leases
‒
net.”
At the end of the majority of leases, the lessee has the
option
to
purchase
the
underlying
equipment for the contractual residual value or return it to the dealer. If the equipment is returned to the dealer, the dealer also has the option to purchase the equipment or return it to us for remarketing.
We estimate the residual values for operating leases at lease inception based on several factors, including lease term, expected hours of usage, historical wholesale sale prices, return experience, intended use of the equipment, market dynamics and trends, and dealer residual guarantees. We review residual value estimates during the lease term and test the carrying value of our operating lease assets for impairment when events or circumstances necessitate. The depreciation is adjusted on a straight-line basis over the remaining lease term if residual value estimates change. Lease agreements include usage limits and specifications on machine condition, which allow us to assess lessees for excess use or damages to the underlying equipment.
We have elected to
combine lease and nonlease components
. The nonlease components relate to preventative maintenance and extended warranty agreements financed by the retail customer. We have also elected to report consideration related to
sales and value added taxes
net of the related tax expense. Property taxes on leased assets are recorded on a gross basis in “Finance and interest income” and “Other operating expenses.” Variable lease revenues relate to property taxes on leased assets in certain markets and late fees.
Lease revenues earned by us follow:
​
​
At the time of accepting a lease that qualifies as a sales-type or direct financing lease, we record the gross amount of lease payments receivable, estimated residual value of the leased equipment, and unearned finance income. The unearned finance income is recognized as revenue over the lease term using the interest method.
Sales-type and direct financing lease receivables by market follow:
​
​
Scheduled payments, including guaranteed residual values, on sales-type and direct financing lease receivables at October 27, 2024 follow:
​
​
Lease payments from operating leases are recorded as income on a straight-line method over the lease terms. Operating lease assets are recorded at cost and depreciated to their estimated residual value on a straight-line method over the terms of the leases.
The cost of equipment on operating leases by market follow:
​
​
The equipment is depreciated on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. The corresponding depreciation expense was $
874
in 2024, $
853
in 2023, and $
827
in 2022.
Lease payments for operating leases are scheduled as follows:

25. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS
Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. To determine fair value, we use various methods including market and income approaches. We utilize valuation models and techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs. The models are industry-standard models that consider various assumptions including time values and yield curves as well as other economic measures. These valuation techniques are consistently applied.
Level 1 measurements consist of quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 measurements include significant other observable inputs such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; identical assets or liabilities in inactive markets; observable inputs such as interest rates and yield curves; and other market-corroborated inputs. Level 3 measurements include significant unobservable inputs.
Fair values of the financing receivables that were issued long-term were based on the discounted values of their related cash flows at interest rates currently being offered by us for similar financing receivables.
The fair values of the remaining financing receivables approximated the carrying amounts.
Fair values of long-term borrowings and short-term securitization borrowings were based on current market quotes for identical or similar borrowings and credit risk, or on the discounted values of their related cash flows at current market interest rates.
The fair values of financial instruments that do not approximate the carrying values at October 27, 2024 and October 29, 2023 follow:
​
*
Fair value measurements above were Level 3 for all financing receivables and Level 2 for all borrowings.
**  Values exclude finance lease liabilities that are presented as borrowings (see Note 24).
​
Assets and liabilities measured at October 27, 2024 and October 29, 2023 at fair value on a recurring basis follow, excluding our cash equivalents, which were carried at a cost that approximates fair value and consisted of money market funds and time deposits:
​
*    Primarily issued by U.S. government sponsored enterprises.
​
Fair value, nonrecurring level 3 measurements from impairments at October 27, 2024 and October 29, 2023 follow:
​
​
The following is a description of the valuation methodologies we use to measure certain financial instruments on the balance sheets at fair value. For more information on asset impairments, see Note 4.
Marketable securities –
The portfolio of investments is valued on a market approach (matrix pricing model) in which all significant inputs are observable or can be derived from or corroborated by observable market data such as interest rates, yield curves, volatilities, credit risk, and prepayment speeds. Funds are valued using the fund’s net asset value, based on the fair value of the underlying securities.
​
76
Table of Contents
​
Derivatives
–
Our derivative financial instruments consist of interest rate contracts (swaps), foreign currency exchange contracts (futures, forwards, and swaps), and cross-currency interest rate contracts (swaps). The portfolio is valued based on an income approach (discounted cash flow) using market observable inputs, including swap curves and both forward and spot exchange rates for currencies.
Deferred consideration
– The total purchase price consideration for three former Deere-Hitachi joint venture factories acquired in 2022 included supply agreement price increases beyond inflation adjustments. This deferred consideration will be paid as we purchase Deere-branded excavators, components, and service parts from Hitachi under the agreement with a duration that ranges from
5
to
30 years
(see Note 3). The deferred consideration balance is reduced as purchases are made and valued on a discounted cash flow approach using market rates.
Inventories
– The impairment was based on net realizable value, less reasonably predictable selling and disposal costs.
Property and equipment
– net
– The valuations were based on cost and market approaches. The inputs include replacement cost estimates adjusted for physical deterioration and economic obsolescence, or quoted prices when available.
Other intangible assets – net
– In 2022, we considered external valuations based on our probability weighted cash flow analysis.
Other assets (Investment in unconsolidated affiliates)
– Other than temporary impairments of investments are measured as the difference between the implied fair value and the carrying value of the investments. The estimated fair value for privately held entities is determined by an income approach (discounted cash flows), which includes inputs such as interest rates and margins (see Note 4).
Assets held for sale
–
The impairment was measured at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell. Fair value was based on the probable sale price. The inputs included estimates of the final sale price (see Note 4).
26. DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS
Fair values of our derivative instruments and the associated notional amounts at the end of 2024 and 2023 were as follows. Assets are recorded in “Other assets,” while liabilities are recorded in “Accounts payable and accrued expenses.”
​
​
The amounts recorded, at October 27, 2024 and October 29, 2023, in the consolidated balance sheets related to borrowings designated in fair value hedging relationships were as follows. Fair value hedging adjustments are included in the carrying amount of the hedged item.

The classification and gains (losses), including accrued interest expense, related to derivative instruments on the statements of consolidated income consisted of the following:
​
​
The amount of loss recorded in OCI at October 27, 2024 that is expected to be reclassified to “Interest expense” in the next twelve months if interest rates remain unchanged is
$
6
after-tax. There were
no
gains or losses reclassified from OCI to earnings based on the probability that the original forecasted transaction would not occur.
Counterparty Risk and Collateral
Derivative instruments are subject to significant concentrations of credit risk to the banking sector. We manage individual counterparty exposure by setting limits that consider the credit rating of the counterparty, the credit default swap spread of the counterparty, and other financial commitments and exposures between us and the counterparty banks. All interest rate derivatives are transacted under International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) documentation. Some of these agreements include credit support provisions. Each master agreement permits the net settlement of amounts owed in the event of default or termination.
Certain of our derivative agreements contain credit support provisions that may require us to post collateral based on the size of the net liability positions and credit ratings. The aggregate fair value of all derivatives with credit-risk-related contingent features that were in a net liability position at October 27, 2024 and October 29, 2023, was $
562
and $
1,076
, respectively. In accordance with the limits established in these agreements, we posted $
245
and $
659
of cash collateral at October 27, 2024 and October 29, 2023, respectively. In addition, we paid $
8
of collateral that was outstanding at both October 27, 2024 and October 29, 2023 to participate in an international futures market to hedge currency exposure, not included in the following table.
​
Derivatives are recorded without offsetting for netting arrangements or collateral.
The impact on the derivative assets and liabilities related to netting arrangements and collateral at October 27, 2024 and October 29, 2023 follows:

​
27. SEGMENT DATA
Our operations are presently organized and reported in
four
business segments. This presentation is consistent with how the chief operating decision maker (the CEO) assesses the performance of the segments and makes decisions about resource allocations.
The PPA segment defines, develops, and delivers global equipment and technology solutions to unlock customer value for production-scale growers of large grains, small grains, cotton, and sugarcane. The segment’s primary products include large and certain mid-size tractors, combines, cotton pickers, sugarcane harvesters and loaders, and soil preparation, seeding, application, crop care equipment, and related attachments and service parts.
The SAT segment defines, develops, and delivers global equipment and technology solutions to unlock customer value for dairy and livestock producers, high-value and small acreage crop producers, and turf and utility customers. The segment’s primary products include certain mid-size tractors, utility and compact utility tractors, as well as hay and forage equipment, riding and commercial lawn equipment, golf course equipment, utility vehicles, and related attachments and service parts.
The CF segment defines, develops, and delivers a broad range of machines and technology solutions organized along the earthmoving, forestry, and roadbuilding production systems. The segment’s primary products include backhoe loaders, crawler dozers and loaders, four-wheel-drive loaders, excavators, skid-steer loaders, milling machines, log harvesters, and related attachments and service parts.
The products and services produced by the segments above are marketed through independent retail dealer networks and major retail outlets. For roadbuilding products in certain markets outside the U.S. and Canada, the products are sold through company-owned sales and service subsidiaries.
The financial services segment finances sales and leases by John Deere dealers of new and used production and precision agriculture equipment, small agriculture and turf equipment, and construction and forestry equipment. In addition, the financial services segment provides wholesale financing to dealers of the foregoing equipment, finances retail revolving charge accounts, and offers extended equipment warranties.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the stockholders and the Board of Directors of Deere & Company:
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Deere & Company and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of October 27, 2024 and October 29, 2023, the related statements of consolidated income, consolidated comprehensive income, changes in consolidated stockholders’ equity and consolidated cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended October 27, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of October 27, 2024 and October 29, 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended October 27, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of October 27, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated December 12, 2024, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.
Sales Incentives — Refer to Note 2 to the financial statements
Critical Audit Matter Description
The Company provides retail discount or financing sales incentives programs to dealers that are due when the dealer sells the equipment to a retail customer.
The estimated cost of these programs is based on:
At the time a sale is recognized, the Company records an estimate of the sales incentive costs. The final cost is determined at the time of the retail sale.
There are numerous programs available at any time, and new programs may be announced after the Company records the equipment sale to the dealer. Changes in the mix and types of sales incentive programs affect these estimates, which are reviewed quarterly. Actual cost differences from the original cost estimate are recognized in “Net sales.” A key assumption is the predictive value of the historical percentage of retail sales incentive costs to retail sales.
We identified the United States and Canada retail sales incentive accrual as a critical audit matter because estimating sales incentive costs requires significant judgment by management and changes in historical percentage of sales incentive costs to retail sales by dealers could have a material impact on the sales incentive accrual. Auditing management’s assumptions about the predictive nature of historical sales incentive costs involves a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort to evaluate the reasonableness of management’s estimates.

​
How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit
Our audit procedures related to testing management’s assumption that historical sales incentive costs are predictive of future incentive costs included the following, among others:
Allowance for Credit Losses – Refer to Notes 2 and 11 to the financial statements
Critical Audit Matter Description
The allowance for credit losses is an estimate of the credit losses expected over the life of the Company’s receivable portfolio. Non-performing receivables are included in the estimate of expected credit losses. The allowance is measured on a collective basis for receivables with similar risk characteristics. Receivables that do not share risk characteristics are evaluated on an individual basis. Risk characteristics include:
The Company utilizes linear regression models to estimate the expected credit losses for large and complex retail customer receivable pools, which represent more than 90 percent of retail customer receivables. These statistical models utilize independent variables, or predictive features, to estimate lifetime default rates, which are subsequently adjusted for expected recoveries to arrive at lifetime credit loss estimates. Independent variables included in the models vary by product, but can include credit quality at time of application, remaining account balance, delinquency status, and various economic factors, such as commodity prices, employment levels, and housing data. The economic factors include forward-looking conditions over the reasonable and supportable forecast period.
Management reviews each model’s output quarterly, and qualitative adjustments are incorporated as necessary to arrive at management’s best estimate of expected credit losses.
We identified the allowance for credit losses by the linear regression models and related independent variables and qualitative adjustments used in determining the Company’s United States and Canada retail customer receivable portfolios as a critical audit matter because determining the appropriate methodology and assumptions used in the estimate requires significant judgment by management. Given the subjective nature and judgment applied by management to determine the allowance for credit losses, auditing the methodology and assumptions requires a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the need to involve credit specialists.
How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit
Our audit procedures to test the allowance for credit losses estimated for the Company’s United States and Canada retail customer receivable portfolio by the linear regression models and related independent variables and qualitative adjustments included the following, among others:

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the stockholders and the Board of Directors of Deere & Company:
Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Deere & Company and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of October 27, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of October 27, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended October 27, 2024 of the Company and our report dated December 12, 2024, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.
Basis for Opinion
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
