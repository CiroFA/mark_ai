Although we believe that the plans, intentions, expectations, assumptions and strategies reflected in our forward-looking statements are reasonable, these statements relate to future events or our future financial performance, and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which are, in some cases, beyond our control.

In addition, we operate in a highly competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risks and uncertainties emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all risks and uncertainties that could have an impact on the forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. No forward-looking statement is a guarantee of future results. These statements are inherently uncertain and investors are cautioned not to unduly rely upon these statements. You should read this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and the documents that we reference in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q completely and with the understanding that our actual future results may be materially different from any future results expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements.
The forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q represent our views as at the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. We anticipate that subsequent events and developments may cause our views to change. However, while we may elect to update these forward-looking statements at some point in the future, we have no current intention of doing so except to the extent required by applicable law. Therefore, these forward-looking statements do not represent our views as of any date other than the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

Basis of Presentation and Consolidation
These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its directly and indirectly held wholly owned subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated upon consolidation.
These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company have been presented in U.S. dollars ("USD") and have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP"), including the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") regarding financial reporting. Certain information and note disclosures normally included in annual financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations.
In the opinion of the Company, the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements contain all adjustments, consisting of only normal recurring adjustments, necessary for the fair statement of its financial position, results of operations and comprehensive income (loss), changes in shareholders' equity and cash flows for the interim periods. These unaudited quarterly condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company's audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included in Item 15 in the Company's 2024 Form 10-K. The consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2024 was derived from the audited annual financial statements, but does not contain all of the footnote disclosures from the annual financial statements.
The quarterly results for the three months ended March 31, 2025 are not necessarily indicative of the results expected for the full fiscal year.
3.
Significant Accounting Policies
There have been no material changes to the Company’s significant accounting policies and no material updates in the Company's assessment of the recent accounting pronouncements not yet adopted during the three months ended March 31, 2025, as compared to the significant accounting policies described in the Company’s annual consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2024.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements, in accordance with U.S. GAAP, requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may differ from the estimates made by management. Significant estimates, judgments and assumptions in these condensed consolidated financial statements include: key judgments related to revenue recognition in determining whether the Company is the principal or an agent to the arrangements with merchants; estimates and judgments involved in applying the measurement alternative associated with equity and other investments in private companies, including revenue growth rates and revenue multiples based on
10
Table of Contents
market comparables; estimates involved in our equity method investment; and the probability and amount of loss contingencies.
Concentration of Credit Risk
The Company’s cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, trade and other receivables, loans, merchant cash advances and foreign exchange derivative instruments subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk. Management mitigates this risk associated with cash and cash equivalents by making deposits and entering into foreign exchange derivative products only with large banks and financial institutions that are considered to be highly creditworthy. We limit the amount of credit exposure with any one financial institution and conduct timely evaluations of the credit worthiness of these financial institutions. Management mitigates the risks associated with marketable securities by adhering to its investment policy, which stipulates minimum rating requirements, maximum investment exposures and maximum maturities. Due to the Company’s diversified merchant base, there is no particular concentration of credit risk related to the Company’s trade and other receivables, loans receivable and merchant cash advances. Trade and other receivables, loans receivable and merchant cash advances are monitored on an ongoing basis to ensure timely collection of amounts. There are no receivables from individual merchants accounting for 10% or more of revenues or receivables.
Equity and Other Investments Risk
The Company holds equity and other investments that are subject to a wide variety of market-related risks that could substantially reduce or increase the fair value of our holdings. The Company's equity and other investments in public companies are recorded at fair value, which is subject to market price volatility. The Company also holds an investment option to purchase Series B common shares in Klaviyo, Inc. which is accounted for as a derivative instrument and valued using the Black-Scholes model, and is subject to market price volatility as well as a discount for lack of marketability. The Company's equity investments in private companies are recorded using the measurement alternative and are assessed each reporting period for observable price changes and impairments, which may involve estimates and judgments given the lack of readily available market data. Certain equity investments in private companies are in the early stages of development and are inherently risky due to their lack of operational history. Furthermore, for the equity method investment, Shopify's share of income and loss from these investments may cause volatility to Shopify's earnings. The Company's debt investments in convertible notes of private companies are recorded at fair value, which are impacted by the underlying entities' valuations and interest rates.
The Company has a high concentration of risk associated with a small number of equity and other investments that are impacted by fluctuations in their fair values or by observable changes or impairments.
Foreign Exchange Risk
The Company's results of operations and foreign currency assets and liabilities are exposed to foreign currency fluctuations.
While the majority of the Company's revenues, cost of revenues and operating expenses are denominated in USD, a significant portion are denominated in foreign currencies. Due to offering Shopify Payments, Shopify Capital, subscriptions and other billings to select countries in local currency, a significant proportion of revenue transactions are denominated in British pound sterling ("GBP"), Euros ("EUR") and Canadian dollars ("CAD"). Furthermore, a significant proportion of operating expenses are also incurred in the aforementioned foreign currencies.
Although foreign currency fluctuations associated with revenues and costs may partially offset one another in earnings, the Company uses foreign exchange derivative products to mitigate a portion of the remaining exposure of foreign currency fluctuations as discussed in Note 4. By their nature, derivative financial instruments involve risk, including the credit risk of non-performance by counterparties.

Financial Instruments
The Company measures financial instruments based on quoted prices in active markets (Level 1), inputs from similar instruments such as quoted prices or other observable market data (Level 2) or where little or no market activity exists, using unobservable inputs that require judgment or estimation (Level 3).
Debt Securities
The Company holds certain debt securities that are classified as held-to-maturity at the time of purchase as the Company has both the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity. The fair value of corporate bonds are based upon Level 2 inputs, which include period-end mid-market quotations for each underlying contract as calculated by the financial institution with which the Company has transacted. The quotations are based on bid/ask quotations and represent the discounted future settlement amounts based on current market rates.
The Company also holds debt securities in the form of convertible notes in private companies classified as available-for-sale for which the Company has elected to apply the fair value option. The investments are carried at fair value at each balance sheet date and any movements in the fair values are classified as "Other expense, net" in the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss).
The following tables summarize debt securities by balance sheet classification and level within the fair value hierarchy:
The fair values of marketable securities above include accrued interest of $
10
million, which is excluded from the carrying amounts. The accrued interest is included in "Trade and other receivables, net" in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. Additional accrued interest of $
72
million recognized on the convertible notes in private companies is included in the carrying amount and fair value above.

Table of Contents
The fair values above include accrued interest of $
19
million, which is excluded from the carrying amounts. The accrued interest is included in "Trade and other receivables, net" in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. Additional accrued interest of $
62
million recognized on the convertible notes in private companies is included in the carrying amount and fair value above.
The following table outlines estimated fair values of our debt securities by date of contractual maturity as of March 31, 2025:
Equity Securities
The Company holds equity investments in public and private companies that were obtained through a combination of direct investment and strategic partnerships.
Equity Investments with Readily Determinable Fair Values
Equity investments with readily determinable fair values are comprised of:
(1)
In the three months ended March 31, 2025, $
14
million was transferred from Level 3 to Level 1, respectively, due to the vesting of warrants (March 31, 2024 - $
9
million). The equity investments categorized as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy represent unvested warrants that require the application of a discount for lack of marketability which was
18
% at March 31, 2025 (December 31, 2024 -
18
%).

Adjustments related to equity and other investments with readily determinable fair values for the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024 were as follows:
Equity Investments without Readily Determinable Fair Values
The carrying value of equity investments in private companies without readily determinable fair values were as follows:
Adjustments related to equity and other investments without readily determinable fair values for the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024 were as follows:
(1)
During the three months ended March 31, 2025, the Company applied certain valuation methods based on information available, including the market approach and option pricing models in order to quantify the level of impairment recognized. During the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Company identified an observable price change resulting in the remeasurement of private investments at fair value on a non-recurring basis. The resulting unrealized losses and impairments were presented as "Net unrealized (loss) gain on equity and other investments" in the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss).
As of March 31, 2025, included in the total $
709
million of equity and other investments without readily determinable fair values, $
585
million was remeasured at fair value and was classified within Level 3 of the fair value measurement hierarchy on a non-recurring basis.
In April 2025, consistent with the Company's ongoing strategic investments, the Company invested $
67
million in private companies.
Equity Method Investment
The Company holds an equity method investment in Flexport which is presented within "Equity method investment" in the condensed consolidated balance sheets and is carried at the amount of Shopify’s original investment, as adjusted each period for Shopify’s share of the investee’s income or loss and the basis difference amortization, which is the difference between the fair value of our investment in the
14
Table of Contents
company and the underlying equity in the net assets of the investee. Results are reported with a one-quarter delay due to the timing of financial information availability from the investee. For the three months ended March 31, 2025, our share of the loss in the investee was $
23
million (March 31, 2024 - $
44
million), and is presented within "Net loss on equity method investment" in the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss).
Derivative Instruments and Hedging
As of March 31, 2025, the Company held foreign exchange forward contracts and options for USD, GBP, Australian dollars ("AUD") and CAD with a total notional value of $
504
million (December 31, 2024 - $
454
million), to fund a portion of its operations. The fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts and options was based upon Level 2 inputs, which included period-end mid-market quotations for each underlying contract as calculated by the financial institution with which the Company has transacted. The quotations are based on bid/ask quotations and represent the discounted future settlement amounts based on current market rates.
Derivative Instruments Designated as Hedges
The Company has a hedging program to mitigate the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on future cash flows and earnings. Under this program, the Company has entered into foreign exchange forward contracts and options with certain financial institutions and designated those hedges as cash flow hedges. The Company is hedging cash flows associated with payroll and facility costs.
The fair values of outstanding derivative instruments were as follows:
Unrealized gains and losses related to changes in the fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts and options designated as cash flow hedges were as follows:
These unrealized gains and losses were included in "Accumulated other comprehensive loss", "Other current assets" and "Accounts payable and accrued liabilities" in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. These amounts are expected to be reclassified into earnings over the next twelve months.
Realized losses related to the maturity of foreign exchange forward contracts and options designated as cash flow hedges were as follows:

Trade and Other Receivables
Trade receivables and unbilled revenues, net of allowance for credit losses, were as follows:
Unbilled revenues represent amounts not yet billed related to partner referral fees, subscription fees for Plus merchants, shipping charges and transaction fees as of the condensed consolidated balance sheet date.
The allowance for credit losses reflects the Company's best estimate of probable losses inherent in the unbilled revenues and trade receivables accounts. The Company determined the provision based on known troubled accounts, historical experience, supportable forecasts of collectibility and other currently available evidence.
Activity in the allowance for credit losses was as follows for the three months ended:

Loans and Merchant Cash Advances
(1)
Included in the loans receivable gross balance as of March 31, 2025 is $
20
million of interest receivable (December 31, 2024 - $
15
million).
Certain loans and merchant cash advances are facilitated by the Company and originated by a bank partner, from whom the Company then purchases the loans and merchant cash advances obtaining all rights, title and interest or discount. In the three months ended March 31, 2025, the Company purchased $
821
million of loans and merchant cash advances to Shopify merchants (March 31, 2024 - $
587
million). For some loans, the Company sells its full rights, title and interest to third-party investors. We account for the asset transfer as a sale and derecognize the full amount the Company paid to its bank partner to originate the loan and record a gain on sale of the loans sold to the third-party investor as revenue upon transfer of title. In the three months ended March 31, 2025, the Company did

Deferred Revenue
(1)
Deferral of revenue includes only the portion of collections from merchant billings throughout the period, primarily related to subscription fees, for which the services have not yet been provided. The amounts primarily exclude subscription revenue that has both been deferred and recognized within the period presented.
The opening balances of current and long-term deferred revenue were $
302
million and $
196
million, respectively, as of January 1, 2024.
As of March 31, 2025, the long-term deferred revenue, excluding non-cash consideration received, will be recognized ratably over the remaining terms of the contracts with the customers, which range from
two
to
three years
.
The Company has received non-cash consideration in the form of equity investments in exchange for services to be rendered as part of strategic partnerships. As the Company is required to provide referral services and other services to support the partners' merchant offerings over the period of the performance obligations, revenue is deferred and recognized over time on a ratable basis over the expected terms of the contracts.

Convertible Senior Notes
In September 2020, the Company issued $
920
million aggregate principal amount of
0.125
% convertible senior notes due 2025 (the "Notes"). The net proceeds from the issuance of the Notes were $
908
million after deducting underwriting fees and offering costs.
The interest on the Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on May 1 and November 1 of each year, beginning on May 1, 2021. The Notes will mature on November 1, 2025, unless earlier redeemed or repurchased by the Company or converted pursuant to their terms.
The Notes have a conversion rate of 6.9440 Class A subordinate voting shares per one thousand dollars of principal amount of Notes, which is equivalent to a conversion price of approximately $
144.01
per share, adjusted to give effect to the share split effected in June 2022. The conversion rate is subject to adjustment following the occurrence of certain specified events, as set out or defined in the supplemental indenture governing the Notes. In addition, upon the occurrence of a make-whole fundamental change prior to the maturity date or upon our issuance of a notice of redemption, as set out or defined in the supplemental indenture governing the Notes, the Company will, in certain circumstances, increase the conversion rate by a number of additional Class A subordinate voting shares for a holder that elects to convert its Notes in connection with such make-whole fundamental change or during the relevant redemption period.
The Company accounts for the Notes as a single unit of account on the balance sheet. The carrying value of the liability is represented by the face amount of the Notes, less total offering costs, plus any amortization of offering costs. Total offering costs upon issuance of the Notes were $
12
million and are amortized to interest expense using the effective interest rate method over the contractual term of the Notes. Interest expense is recognized at an annual effective interest rate of
0.38
% over the contractual term of the Notes.
The net carrying amount of the outstanding Notes was as follows:
As of March 31, 2025, the estimated fair value of the Notes was approximately $
923
million (December 31, 2024 - $
939
million). The estimated fair value was determined based on the last executed trade for the Notes of the reporting period in an over-the-counter market, which is considered as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.

Income Taxes
The Company's recovery of, or provision for, income taxes is determined by applying the estimated annual effective tax rate to income or loss from recurring operations and adding the effects of any discrete income tax items specific to the period.
The Company updates its estimate of the annual effective tax rate each quarter and makes cumulative adjustments if its estimated annual tax rate changes. The Company’s effective tax rate may be subject to fluctuation during the year as new information is obtained, which may affect the assumptions used to estimate the annual effective tax rate, including factors such as the mix of forecasted pre-tax earnings in the various jurisdictions in which the Company operates, valuation allowances against deferred tax assets, the recognition and derecognition of tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions and changes in or the interpretation of tax laws in jurisdictions where the Company conducts business.
The Company had a recovery of income taxes of $
88
million in the three months ended March 31, 2025 primarily as a result of unrealized loss on equity and other investments, partially offset by earnings in jurisdictions predominantly outside of North America.
The Company had a provision for income taxes of $
17
million in the three months ended March 31, 2024 primarily on account of earnings in jurisdictions outside of North America.

Net Loss per Share
The Company applies the two-class method to calculate its basic and diluted net loss per share as Class A subordinate voting shares and Class B restricted voting shares are participating securities with equal participation rights and are entitled to receive dividends on a share for share basis. The Company uses the treasury stock method and if-converted method for calculating the effect of dilutive potential common stock from employee stock options and employee RSUs and from its Notes, respectively.
The following table summarizes the reconciliation of the basic weighted average number of shares outstanding and the diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding:

Business Combinations
Vantage Discovery Inc.
In March 2025, the Company completed the acquisition of Vantage Discovery Inc. (“Vantage”), a company based in Austin, Texas, that provides AI-powered search and content discovery services. By integrating Vantage’s hybrid search engine architecture that combines traditional search engines with vector databases and large language models, the development of AI-powered, multi-vector search across Search APIs, Shop and Storefront search offerings will be accelerated. The Company acquired
100
percent of the outstanding shares of Vantage in exchange for cash consideration of $
59
million. In connection with the transaction, $
24
million in restricted shares were granted and $
6
million in cash are being accounted for as compensation as these amounts are related to post-combination services.
The following table summarizes the purchase price allocation of the Vantage assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date:
The acquired technology has an estimated fair value of $
20
million using a cost approach and is being amortized over
three years
. Goodwill from the Vantage acquisition is primarily attributable to the expected synergies that will result from integrating Vantage's technology with Shopify's Search offering, and the acquisition of the assembled workforce.
None
of the goodwill recognized is deductible for income tax purposes. There is no net deferred tax liability related to taxable temporary difference on acquired intangible assets due to offsetting deferred tax assets primarily related to losses from the pre-acquisition period.

Business Overview
We believe we can help merchants of all verticals and sizes, from aspirational entrepreneurs to companies with large-scale, direct-to-consumer or B2B operations, or both, realize their potential at all stages of their business life cycle. In the three months ended March 31, 2025, our platform facilitated gross merchandise volume ("GMV") of $74.8 billion, representing an increase of 23% from the three months ended March 31, 2024. A detailed description of this metric is presented below in the section entitled, "Key Performance Indicators".
During the three months ended March 31, 2025, our total revenue was $2.4 billion, an increase of 27% versus the three months ended March 31, 2024. Our business model has two revenue components: a recurring subscription component we call subscription solutions and a merchant success-based component we call merchant solutions.
In the three months ended March 31, 2025, subscription solutions revenues accounted for 26% of our total revenues (27% in the three months ended March 31, 2024). We offer a range of plans that increase in price depending on additional features and economic considerations. Shopify Plus is offered at a starting rate that is several times that of our standard Shopify plans. Shopify Plus solves for the complexity of merchants as they grow and scale globally, offering additional functionality and support, including features like Shopify Audiences, B2B features and Launchpad, for ecommerce automation. BarkBox, Vuori, BevMo, Carrier, JB Hi-Fi, Meta, ButcherBox, SKIMS and Supreme are a few of our notable merchants seeking a reliable, cost-effective and scalable commerce solution. The flexibility of our pricing plans is designed to help our merchants grow in a cost-effective manner and to provide more advanced features and support as their business needs evolve.
Revenue from subscription solutions is generated through the sale of subscriptions to our platform, including variable platform fees, as well as through the sale of subscriptions to our POS Pro offering, the sale of apps, the sale of themes and the registration of domain names. Subscription solutions revenues
27
Table of Contents
increased from $511 million in the three months ended March 31, 2024 to $620 million in the three months ended March 31, 2025, representing an increase of 21%. Our merchants typically enter into monthly subscription agreements. The revenue from these agreements is recognized over time on a ratable basis over the contractual term and therefore we have deferred revenue on our balance sheet. We do not consider this deferred revenue balance to be a good indicator of future revenue. Instead, we believe Monthly Recurring Revenue ("MRR") is most closely correlated with the long-term value of our merchant relationships. As of March 31, 2025, MRR totaled $182 million, representing an increase of 21% relative to MRR at March 31, 2024. A detailed description of this metric is presented below in the section entitled, "Key Performance Indicators".
We offer a variety of merchant solutions that are designed to add value to our merchants by passing on our economies of scale and augment our subscription solutions. During the three months ended March 31, 2025, merchant solutions revenues accounted for 74% of total revenues (73% in the three months ended March 31, 2024). We principally generate merchant solutions revenues from payment processing fees and currency conversion fees from Shopify Payments. Shopify Payments is a fully integrated payment processing service that allows our merchants to accept and process payment cards online and offline. In addition to payment processing fees and currency conversion fees from Shopify Payments, we also generate merchant solutions revenue from referral fees from third parties, other transaction services and other services rendered as part of strategic partnerships and Shopify Capital. Shopify Capital helps eligible merchants secure financing and is currently available for merchants in the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada and Australia. The majority of our merchant solutions revenues are directionally correlated with the level of GMV that our merchants process through our platform. Merchant solutions revenues increased from $1.4 billion in the three months ended March 31, 2024 to $1.7 billion in the three months ended March 31, 2025, representing an increase of 29%.
Our business model is driven by our ability to attract new merchants, retain revenue from existing merchants and increase sales to both new and existing merchants. Our merchants represent a wide array of retail verticals, business sizes, and geographies and no single merchant has ever represented more than five percent of our total revenues in a single reporting period. We believe that our future success depends on many factors, including our ability to expand our merchant base; localize features for specific geographies; retain merchants as they grow their businesses on our platform and adopt more features; offer more sales channels that connect merchants with potential customers; develop new solutions to extend our platform’s functionality and catalyze merchants’ sales growth; leverage emerging technologies, including AI; enhance our ecosystem and partner programs; provide a high level of merchant support; hire, retain and motivate qualified personnel; and build with a focus on maximizing long-term value.
We have focused on rapidly growing our business and plan to continue making investments to drive future growth. We believe that our investments will increase our revenue base, improve the retention of this base and strengthen our ability to increase sales to our merchants. Building a 100-year company requires a balance between growth and profitability, and we maintain a portfolio of investments with varying time horizons in our cash management program.
Key Performance Indicators
Our key performance indicators, which we do not consider to be non-GAAP measures, that we use to evaluate our business, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, formulate financial projections and make strategic decisions are MRR and GMV. Our key performance indicators may be calculated in a manner different than similar key performance indicators used by other companies.
The following table shows MRR and GMV for the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024:
28
Table of Contents
Monthly Recurring Revenue
We calculate MRR at the end of each period by multiplying the number of merchants who have subscription plans with us at the period end date by the average monthly subscription plan fee, which excludes variable platform fees, in effect on the last day of that period, assuming they maintain their subscription plans the following month. Subscription plans to both our platform and our POS Pro offering are included in this calculation. When applicable, MRR relating to subscription plans billed in a merchant's local currency is converted to USD using the respective currency exchange rate as of the period end date. Prospective merchants that have joined the platform through special new merchant trial incentives, including paid trials, are included in MRR at their trial price while merchants on free trials are excluded from the calculation of MRR through the duration of the free trial. MRR allows us to average our various pricing plans and billing periods into a single, consistent number that we can track over time. We also analyze the factors that make up MRR, specifically the number of paying merchants using our platform and changes in our average revenue earned from subscription plan fees per paying merchant. In addition, we use MRR to forecast monthly, quarterly and annual subscription plan revenue, which makes up the majority of our subscription solutions revenue. We had $182 million of MRR as of March 31, 2025 compared to $151 million as of March 31, 2024.
In the three months ended March 31, 2025, the MRR growth rate for the period was lower than the same period in 2024 driven mainly by the impact of extending the length of the paid trials from 1 month to 3 months.
Gross Merchandise Volume
GMV is the total dollar value of orders facilitated through our platform including certain apps and channels for which a revenue-sharing arrangement is in place in the period, net of refunds, and inclusive of shipping and handling, duty and value-added taxes. GMV does not represent revenue earned by us. However, the volume of GMV facilitated through our platform is an indicator of the success of our merchants and the strength of our platform. Our merchant solutions revenues are also directionally correlated with the level of GMV facilitated through our platform. For the three months ended March 31, 2025 we facilitated GMV of $74.8 billion (March 31, 2024 - $60.9 billion), representing year-over-year growth of 23% (2024 vs 2023 - 23%). On a constant currency basis, in which GMV in the three months ended March 31, 2025 is converted using the comparative period's monthly average exchange rates, year-over-year growth was 25% (2024 vs 2023 - 23%).
Factors Affecting the Comparability of Our Results
Change in Revenue Mix
As a result of the continued growth of Shopify Payments, referral fees, other transaction services and other services rendered as part of strategic partnerships and Shopify Capital, our revenues from merchant solutions have increased significantly. Merchant solutions are intended to complement subscription solutions by providing additional value to our merchants and increasing their use of our platform. Gross profit margins on Shopify Payments, the biggest driver of merchant solutions revenue, are typically lower than on subscription solutions due to the associated third-party costs of providing this solution. We view this revenue stream as beneficial to our operating margins, as Shopify Payments requires significantly less sales and marketing and research and development expense than Shopify’s core subscription business. The lower margins on merchant solutions compared to subscription solutions means that the continued growth of merchant solutions may cause a decline in our overall gross margin percentage.
Seasonality
Our merchant solutions revenues are directionally correlated with the level of GMV that our merchants facilitated through our platform. Our merchants typically process additional GMV during the fourth quarter holiday season. As a result, we have historically generated higher merchant solutions revenues in our fourth quarter than in other quarters. While we believe that this seasonality has affected and will continue to affect our quarterly results, our continued growth has partially masked seasonal trends to date. As a result of the continued growth of our merchant solutions offerings, we believe that our
29
Table of Contents
business may become more seasonal in the future and that historical patterns in our business may not be a reliable indicator of our future performance.
Foreign Currency Fluctuations
While the majority of our revenues, cost of revenues and operating expenses are denominated in USD, a significant portion are denominated in foreign currencies. Due to offering Shopify Payments, Shopify Capital, subscriptions and other billings to select countries in local currency, a significant proportion of revenue transactions are denominated in EUR, GBP and CAD. A significant proportion of operating expenses are also incurred and expected to be included in the aforementioned foreign currencies. To help mitigate the impacts associated with foreign currency fluctuations on future cash flows from operating expenses, we maintain a portfolio of foreign exchange forward contracts and options designated as hedging instruments. As our operations continue to expand internationally, we may be exposed to additional fluctuations in other foreign currencies. Refer to Part I — Item 3 "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information on the effect on reported results of changes in foreign exchange rates.
Key Components of Results of Operations
See Part II — Item 7 "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in our 2024 Form 10-K for details on the key components of results of operations. There have been no material changes to our key components of results of operations during the three months ended March 31, 2025, as compared to those described in our 2024 Form 10-K.

Revenues
Subscription Solutions
Subscription solutions revenues increased for the three months ended March 31, 2025 compared to the same period in 2024. The period-over-period increase was primarily a result of growth in MRR, which was driven largely by a higher number of merchants using our platform.
Merchant Solutions
Merchant solutions revenues increased for the three months ended March 31, 2025 compared to the same period in 2024. The increase in merchant solutions revenues was primarily a result of Shopify Payments revenue, relating to payment processing and currency conversion fees, growing in the three months ended March 31, 2025 compared to the same period in 2024. This increase was a result of an increase in our Shopify Payments penetration rate and the number of merchants using our platform. These factors drove $11.3 billion of additional GMV facilitated using Shopify Payments in the three months ended March 31, 2025 compared to the same period in 2024, representing growth of 31%. For the three months ended March 31, 2025, the Shopify Payments penetration rate was 64%, resulting in GMV of $47.5 billion that was facilitated using Shopify Payments. This compares to a penetration rate of 60% resulting in GMV of $36.2 billion that was facilitated using Shopify Payments in the same period in 2024.

Cost of Revenues
Cost of Subscription Solutions
Cost of subscription solutions increased for the three months ended March 31, 2025 compared to the same period in 2024. The increase was due mainly to an increase in cloud and infrastructure costs offset by a decrease in support costs. As a percentage of revenues, cost of subscription solutions remained flat for the three months ended March 31, 2025 compared to the same period in 2024.
Cost of Merchant Solutions
Cost of merchant solutions increased for the three months ended March 31, 2025 compared to the same period in 2024. The increase was primarily due to higher volume of payment processing fees resulting from an increase in GMV facilitated through Shopify Payments. As a percentage of revenues, cost of merchant solutions increased for the three months ended March 31, 2025 compared to the same period in 2024, primarily due to Shopify Payments representing a larger percentage of total revenue.
Gross Profit
Operating Expenses
Sales and Marketing
Sales and marketing expenses increased for the three months ended March 31, 2025 compared to the same period in 2024, due to increases of $35 million in overall marketing program spend and $14 million in employee-related costs, offset by $7 million decrease in payouts related to our affiliate partner programs.

Research and development expenses increased for the three months ended March 31, 2025 compared to the same period in 2024, due to an increase of $37 million in employee-related costs.
General and Administrative
General and administrative expenses decreased for the three months ended March 31, 2025 compared to the same period in 2024, due to decreases of $10 million in indirect taxes and $5 million in employee-related costs.
Transaction and Loan Losses
Transaction and loan losses increased for the three months ended March 31, 2025 compared to the same period in 2024, primarily due to an increase of $23 million in losses related to lending services driven by an expansion of our offerings and programs relative to the same period in 2024.
Net Loss on Equity and Equity Method Investments
*Not a meaningful comparison
In the three months ended March 31, 2025, we had a net loss on equity and other investments of $1,021 million, which included a $930 million unrealized loss in investments with readily determinable fair values which was the result of the change in share prices from December 31, 2024 to March 31, 2025 and a $86 million unrealized loss in an investment option. Additionally, we had a net loss of $23 million on our equity method investment.
In the three months ended March 31, 2024, we had a net loss on equity and other investments of $373 million which included a $351 million unrealized loss in investments with readily determinable fair values and was the result of the net change in share prices from December 31, 2023 to March 31, 2024. Additionally, we had a net loss of $44 million on our equity method investment.

Other Income, Net
In the three months ended March 31, 2025, the majority of our other income was driven by interest income of $65 million recognized on marketable securities compared to interest income of $79 million recognized on investments for the same period in 2024.
Recovery of (Provision for) Income Taxes
*Not a meaningful comparison
We had a recovery of income taxes of $88 million in the three months ended March 31, 2025, primarily as a result of unrealized loss on equity and other investments, partially offset by earnings in jurisdictions predominantly outside of North America.
We had a provision for income taxes of $17 million in the three months ended March 31, 2024, primarily on account of earnings in jurisdictions outside of North America.

Summary of Quarterly Results
The following table sets forth selected unaudited quarterly results of operations data for each of the eight quarters ended March 31, 2025. The information for each of these quarters has been derived from unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements that were prepared on the same basis as the audited annual financial statements and, in the opinion of management, reflects all adjustments, which include only normal recurring adjustments, necessary for the fair presentation of the results of operations for these periods in accordance with U.S. GAAP. This data should be read in conjunction with our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and audited consolidated financial statements and related notes for the relevant period. These quarterly operating results are not necessarily indicative of our operating results for a full year or any future periods.

Includes stock-based compensation expense and related payroll taxes as follows:
(a)
Includes accelerated stock-based compensation of $1 million and $4 million in sales and marketing during the second and third quarters of 2023, respectively, and $164 million in research and development during the second quarter of 2023.
(2)
Includes amortization of acquired intangibles as follows:
(3)
In the second quarter of 2024, we released an accrual for an estimated liability of $55 million associated with a legal matter.
(4)
In the second quarter of 2023, we had $148 million of severance related costs associated with reductions in workforce with $28 million in sales and marketing, $102 million in research and development and $18 million in general and administrative.
(5)
In the third quarter of 2023, we had $38 million of impairment related costs associated with right-of-use assets and leasehold improvements.
We believe that period-over-period comparisons are more meaningful than our sequential results due to seasonality in our business. While we believe that this seasonality has affected and will continue to affect our quarterly results, our rapid growth has partially masked seasonal trends to date. Our merchant solutions revenues are directionally correlated with our merchants' GMV. Our merchants' GMV typically increases during the fourth-quarter holiday season. As a result, we have historically generated higher merchant solutions revenues in our fourth quarter than in other quarters. As a result of the growth of our merchant solutions offerings, we believe that our business may become more seasonal in the future, and that historical patterns in our business may not be a reliable indicator of our future performance.
Quarterly Revenue and Gross Margin Trends
Historically, revenues experienced a seasonal decrease in our first quarter as consumers typically reduce their spending following the holiday season resulting in a seasonal decrease in GMV per merchant, which was not completely offset by merchant and MRR growth. Subsequently, revenues have increased in each of the next three quarters as a result of merchant, MRR and overall GMV growth. Our merchants have processed additional GMV during the fourth-quarter holiday seasons, and as a result we have generated higher merchant solutions revenues in our fourth quarters compared to other quarters. Due to the continued growth of our merchant solutions offerings, we believe that our business may become more seasonal in the future.
Our gross margin is generally driven by the mix between our higher margin subscription solutions revenue and lower margin merchant solutions revenue. While our total revenues have increased in recent periods, the mix has shifted towards merchant solutions revenue, most notably in the fourth quarter due to higher holiday volume of orders facilitated and the resulting Shopify Payments revenue during this period. We expect this overall trend to continue over time.
In connection with expanding our operations internationally, we anticipate a growing proportion of our revenues and cost of sales transactions to be incurred in foreign currencies as compared to USD due to increased Shopify Payments, Shopify Capital, subscriptions and other billings to select countries in local

currency. Fluctuations in foreign currencies relative to the USD may impact identified quarterly and yearly trends.
Quarterly Operating Expenses Trends
Excluding the events described below and outlined in the tables above, prior to the second quarter of 2023 operating expense growth was relatively steady. Following the workforce reduction and sales of our logistics businesses in the second quarter of 2023, operating expenses decreased and continued to decrease in the third quarter of 2023. In the fourth quarter of 2023 and the first quarter of 2024, we saw increased spend to support our operations growth. Due to the reversal of a previously recorded estimated legal liability in the second quarter of 2024, operating expenses decreased versus the first quarter of 2024. In the third quarter of 2024 and continuing into the first quarter of 2025, operating expenses increased in connection with operations growth.
We recognized an impairment on the sales of our logistics businesses in the second quarter of 2023. We also recognized restructuring expenses in the second quarter of 2023 which caused an increase in research and development, sales and marketing and general and administrative spend relative to revenue in the quarter. We impaired certain office spaces in the third quarter of 2023, which caused an increase in general and administrative expense relative to revenue. In the second quarter of 2024, we released the remaining portion of the litigation contingency recorded in the second quarter of 2022 which decreased general and administrative spend. In addition, the sales of our logistics businesses in the second quarter of 2023, impacted the comparability of operating expenses. We note a significant portion of our operating expenses are incurred in foreign currencies which may impact the comparability of our quarterly and yearly trends.
Quarterly (Loss) Gain on Equity and Equity Method Investments and Other Income Trends
Historically, there have been no consistent trends associated with (loss) gain on equity and equity method investments and other income as changes are impacted by fluctuations in the fair value of our equity investments in public companies with readily determinable fair values, observable changes or impairments associated with our equity investments in private companies without readily determinable fair values, changes in our equity method investment based on our share of income and loss, including amortization of the basis difference, changes in the fair value of our investments in convertible notes of private companies, foreign exchange rates and interest rates. The results from these changes may fluctuate from period to period and may cause volatility to our earnings as well as impact comparability of our results from period to period.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
We generate liquidity through operating cash flows. Previously, we have financed our operations from sale of equity securities and the sale of the Notes, raising approximately $7.8 billion, net of issuance costs, from investors.
Shopify maintains a short-form base shelf prospectus with the securities commissions in each of the provinces and territories of Canada, except Quebec, and a corresponding shelf registration statement on Form F-10 with the U.S. SEC. This allows us to offer Class A subordinate voting shares, preferred shares, debt securities, warrants, subscription receipts, units, or any combination thereof, from time to time during the 25-month period that the shelf prospectus is effective. The type of securities and the specific terms thereof will be determined at the time of any offering and will be described in the applicable prospectus supplement to be filed separately with Canadian securities regulators and the SEC.
Our principal cash requirements are for working capital and ongoing operations. Excluding current deferred revenue and convertible senior notes, working capital as of March 31, 2025 was $6.7 billion. The $920 million in aggregate principal amount of Notes due in less than one year may be settled in Class A subordinate voting shares instead of cash, at our option. As a result of our employee compensation program there is a potential for an increase in cash usage as employees have the ability to elect how much of their total compensation will be in the form of cash versus stock-based compensation awards. Given the ongoing cash generated from operations and our existing cash and cash equivalents, we believe there is sufficient liquidity to meet our current and planned financial obligations over the next 12 months and into the foreseeable future. Our future financing requirements will depend on many factors, including but not limited to our growth rate, subscription renewal activity, the timing and extent of

spending to support development of our platform, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, the macroeconomic conditions and overall levels of consumer spending on goods and potential strategic investments and acquisitions activity. Although we currently are not a party to any material undisclosed agreement and do not have any understanding with any third parties with respect to potential material investments in, or material acquisitions of, businesses or technologies, we may enter into these types of arrangements in the future, which could also require us to seek additional equity or debt financing. Additional funds may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all.
In April 2025, consistent with the Company's ongoing strategic investments, the Company invested $67 million in private companies.
Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities
Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities increased by $35 million to $5.5 billion as of March 31, 2025 from $5.5 billion as of December 31, 2024, primarily as a result of cash provided by our operations and proceeds from exercise of stock options partially offset by the purchase and origination of loans, net of repayments, acquisition of business, net of cash acquired and the purchase of equity and other investments. Cash equivalents and marketable securities include money market funds, term deposits, U.S. federal bonds and agency securities and corporate bonds and commercial paper, all maturing within the 12 months from March 31, 2025.
The following table summarizes our total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as well as our operating, investing and financing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024:
(1)
Excludes $894 million and $175 million of marketable securities classified in "Long-term Investments" as of March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively.
Cash Flows From Operating Activities
Our largest source of operating cash is from merchant solutions. Within merchant solutions, the largest source of cash flows are Shopify Payments processing fee arrangements, which are received on a daily basis as transactions are processed. We also generate significant cash flows from our subscription solutions with subscription revenues. These payments are typically paid to us at the beginning of the applicable subscription period, except for our Shopify Plus merchants who typically pay us at the end of their monthly billing cycle.
Our primary uses of cash from operating activities are for third-party payment processing fees, employee-related expenditures, marketing programs and outsourced hosting costs.
For the period ended March 31, 2025, net cash provided by operating activities was primarily the result of operating income, once adjusted for non-cash items, slightly offset by a use of cash due to an increase in non-cash working capital.
39
Table of Contents
Cash Flows From Investing Activities
Net cash used in investing activities in the three months ended March 31, 2025 was driven by $387 million used for purchases of marketable securities, net of maturities, $168 million used for purchases and originations of loans, net of repayments and sales, $56 million used in acquisitions of businesses, net of cash acquired, $4 million used to purchase equity and other investments and $4 million used to purchase property and equipment, which consisted mainly of computer equipment.
Cash Flows From Financing Activities
Net cash provided by financing activities in the three months ended March 31, 2025 was driven by proceeds from the issuance of Class A subordinate voting shares and Class B restricted multiple voting shares as a result of stock options exercises.
Contractual Obligations
Our principal commitments consist of our Notes, unconditional purchase obligations and obligations under our operating leases for office space. There have been no significant changes to our principal commitments, as compared to the principal commitments described in our 2024 Form 10-K.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
In connection with the sales of our logistics businesses in the second quarter of 2023, we retained our guarantee of certain leases. We also entered into an indemnification agreement that governs the liability obligations of the purchaser in connection with these guarantees. These arrangements, and our obligations arising from such arrangements, are not expected to have a material impact on the current or future financial performance or financial condition of the Company.
Litigation and Loss Contingencies
We are not aware of any litigation matters or loss contingencies that would be expected to have a material adverse effect on the business, condensed consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions. Predicting future events is inherently an imprecise activity and, as such, requires the use of significant judgment. Actual results may vary from our estimates in amounts that may be material to the financial statements. An accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made, and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically, could materially impact our condensed consolidated financial statements.
Our critical accounting policies, estimates, and judgements are discussed in Part II — Item 7 "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" of our 2024 Form 10-K as well as "Note 3 - Significant Accounting Policies" in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I — Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
Item 3: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
We are exposed to market risks, as discussed in Note 3 in our condensed consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes for the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2025, as well as in our audited consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024. These risks primarily include foreign currency exchange risk, equity and other investments risk, interest rate risk, concentration of credit risk and inflation risk, as discussed below. We regularly assess these risks to minimize any adverse effects on our business as a result of those factors.
40
Table of Contents
Foreign Currency Exchange Risk
While the majority of our revenues, cost of revenues and operating expenses are denominated in USD, a significant portion are denominated in foreign currencies. Due to offering Shopify Payments, Shopify Capital, subscriptions and other billing to select countries in local currency, a significant proportion of revenue transactions are denominated in EUR, GBP and CAD. A significant proportion of operating expenses are also incurred in the aforementioned foreign currencies. We therefore are subject to foreign currency exchange risk related to these currencies and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. To help mitigate the impacts associated with foreign currency fluctuations on future cash flows from operating expenses, we maintain a portfolio of foreign exchange derivative products designated as hedging instruments.
Effect of Foreign Exchange Rates
The following non-GAAP financial measures convert our revenues, cost of revenues, operating expenses and income (loss) from operations in the current reporting period using the comparative prior year period's monthly average exchange rates:
(1)
Represents the increase or decrease in GAAP amounts reported resulting from using the comparative period's effective foreign exchange rates. The exchange rate effect is primarily driven by fluctuations in CAD, EUR and AUD foreign exchange rates.
(2)
Represents the outcome that would have resulted if the comparative period's effective foreign exchange rates are applied to the current reporting period.
This effect of foreign exchange rates on our condensed consolidated statements of operations disclosure is a supplement to our condensed consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We have provided the above non-GAAP disclosure as we believe it presents a clear comparison of our period to period operating results by removing the impact of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and to assist investors in understanding our financial and operating performance. Non-GAAP financial measures are not recognized measures for financial statement presentation under U.S. GAAP, do not have standardized meanings and may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other public companies. Such non-GAAP financial measures should be considered as a supplement to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, the corresponding measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

The following table summarizes the effects on revenues, cost of revenues, operating expenses and income (loss) from operations of a 10% strengthening of all foreign currencies the Company transacts in versus the USD without considering the impact of the Company's hedging activities and factoring in any potential changes in demand for the Company's solutions as a result of fluctuations in exchange rates:
(1)
A 10% weakening of the foreign currencies versus the USD would have an equal and opposite impact on the Company's revenues, cost of revenues, operating expenses and income (loss) from operations as presented in the table.
(2)
Represents the increase or decrease in GAAP amounts reported resulting from a 10% strengthening in foreign exchange rates relative to the USD.
(3)
Represents the outcome that would have resulted had the foreign exchange rates relative to the USD in those periods been 10% stronger than they actually were, excluding the impact of our hedging program and without factoring in any potential changes in demand for the Company's solutions as a result of changes in exchange rates.
Equity and Other Investments Risk
We hold equity and other investments that are subject to market-related risks that could substantially reduce or increase the fair value of our holdings. As of March 31, 2025, we had equity and other investments in public and private companies and our equity method investment totaled $4.3 billion. Our equity and other investments with readily determinable fair values, representing $2.3 billion of our investments as of March 31, 2025, are recorded at fair value, which is subject to market price volatility. Our equity investments in private companies, representing $709 million of our investments as of March 31, 2025, are recorded using the measurement alternative and are assessed each reporting period for observable price changes and impairments, which may involve estimates and judgments given the lack of readily available market data. Certain equity investments in private companies are in the early stages of development and are inherently risky due to their lack of operational history. Our equity method investment in Flexport, representing $619 million of our investments as of March 31, 2025, is subject to market-related risks based on our share of income or loss, including amortization of the basis difference, from this investment which may cause volatility to our earnings. Our debt investments in convertible notes of private companies are recorded at fair value represented $560 million of our investments as of March 31, 2025, which are impacted by the underlying entities' valuations and interest rates. Our investment option derivative to purchase Series B common shares in Klaviyo, representing $118 million of our investments as of March 31, 2025, is impacted by market price volatility and interest rates.
Our marketable securities greater than one year, and less than 3 years, representing $894 million of our investments as of March 31, 2025, are recorded at carrying value and any changes in the fair value due to the interest rate are not recorded until the investment is sold as they are classified as "held to maturity".
The results from these changes may fluctuate from period to period and may cause volatility to our earnings as well as impact comparability of our results from period to period.
Interest Rate Risk
We had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities in our cash management program totaling $5.5 billion as of March 31, 2025. The cash and cash equivalents are held for operations and working capital purposes. Our investments within cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities are made for capital
42
Table of Contents
preservation purposes. We do not enter into these types of investments for trading or speculative purposes.
Our cash equivalents and our portfolio of marketable securities are subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates. Fixed rate securities may have their market value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates. Our future investment income may fall short of our expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in interest rates. However, because we classify our debt securities as "held to maturity", no gains or losses are recognized due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity or declines in fair value are determined to be other than temporary.
In September 2020, we issued $920 million aggregate principal amount of Notes. The Notes have a fixed annual interest rate of 0.125%; accordingly, we do not have economic interest rate exposure on the Notes. However, the fair market value of the Notes is exposed to interest rate risk. Generally, the fair market value of our fixed interest rate Notes will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. In addition, the fair market value of the Notes will generally fluctuate as the price of our Class A subordinate voting shares fluctuates. We carry the Notes at face value less debt offering costs, plus any amortization of offering costs, and we present the fair value for required disclosure purposes only.
The Company holds convertible notes in private companies. These investments are classified as available-for-sale debt securities, for which we have elected to account for under the fair value option. These investments are carried at fair value at each balance sheet date and any movements in the fair value are recognized in "Net loss" in the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss). The underlying entity's valuation includes inputs such as interest rates which impact the market value of the investment.
Concentration of Credit Risk
The Company’s cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, trade and other receivables, loans, merchant cash advances and foreign exchange derivative instruments subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk. Management mitigates this risk associated with cash and cash equivalents by making deposits and entering into foreign exchange derivative products only with large banks and financial institutions that are considered to be highly creditworthy. We limit the amount of credit exposure with any one financial institution and conduct timely evaluations of the credit worthiness of these financial institutions. Management mitigates the risks associated with marketable securities by adhering to its investment policy, which stipulates minimum rating requirements, maximum investment exposures and maximum maturities. Due to the Company’s diversified merchant base, there is no particular concentration of credit risk related to the Company’s trade and other receivables, loans receivable and merchant cash advances. Trade and other receivables, loans receivable and merchant cash advances are monitored on an ongoing basis to ensure timely collection of amounts. There are no receivables from individual merchants accounting for 10% or more of revenues or receivables.
Inflation Risk
We are subject to inflation risk that could have a material effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. If our costs were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures, we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases. Our inability or failure to do so could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, our merchants are also subject to risks associated with inflationary pressures that could impact their business and financial condition. These pressures could subsequently result in impacts to our GMV and further affect our business, particularly if economic growth has slowed across many of the regions in which we operate.
Item 4: Controls and Procedures
All control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Accordingly, even disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting determined to be effective can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.

Table of Contents
Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures
Management of the Company, under the supervision of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, is responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined by the SEC) in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act for the Company to ensure that material information relating to the Company, including its consolidated subsidiaries, that is required to be made known to the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer by others within the Company and disclosed by the Company in reports filed or submitted by it under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms; and (ii) accumulated and communicated to the Company's management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, have evaluated the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures and have concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of March 31, 2025.
Changes in internal control over financial reporting
There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a15(f)) identified in connection with the evaluation required by Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(d) or 15d-15(d) that occurred during our most recently completed fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
