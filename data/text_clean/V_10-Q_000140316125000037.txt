NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(UNAUDITED)
Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Organization.
Visa Inc., together with its subsidiaries (Visa or the Company), is a global payments technology company that facilitates global commerce and money movement across more than
200
countries and territories. Visa operates one of the world’s largest electronic payments networks — VisaNet — which provides transaction processing services, primarily authorization, clearing and settlement. The Company offers products, solutions and services that facilitate secure, reliable and efficient money movement for participants in the ecosystem. Visa is not a financial institution and does not issue cards, extend credit or set rates and fees for account holders of Visa products. In most cases, account holder and merchant relationships belong to, and are managed by, Visa’s financial institution clients.
Consolidation and basis of presentation.
The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Visa and its consolidated entities and are presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP). The Company consolidates entities for which it has a controlling financial interest, including variable interest entities (VIEs) for which the Company is the primary beneficiary. The Company’s investments in VIEs have not been material to its unaudited consolidated financial statements as of and for the periods presented. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements are presented in accordance with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requirements for Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and, consequently, do not include all of the annual disclosures required by U.S. GAAP. Reference should be made to Visa’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2024 for additional disclosures, including a summary of the Company’s significant accounting policies.
In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements include all normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the Company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the interim periods presented. The results of operations for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results for the full year.
Use of estimates.
The preparation of the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the unaudited consolidated financial statements and reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. These estimates may change as new events occur and additional information is obtained, and will be recognized in the period in which such changes occur. Future actual results could differ materially from these estimates.
Note 2—Acquisitions
In December 2024, Visa acquired Featurespace Limited, a developer of real-time artificial intelligence payments protection technology that prevents and mitigates payments fraud and financial crime risks, for a purchase consideration of $
946
million. The Company allocated $
152
million of the purchase consideration to technology, customer relationships, other net assets acquired and deferred tax liabilities and the remaining $
794
million to goodwill.

Table of Contents
Note 3—Revenue
The nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of the Company’s revenue and cash flows and how they are affected by economic factors are most appropriately depicted through the Company’s revenue categories and geographical markets.
The following tables disaggregate the Company’s net revenue by revenue category and by geography:
For the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, revenue from value-added services was $
2.6
billion and $
2.1
billion, respectively. For the six months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, revenue from value-added services was $
5.0
billion and $
4.2
billion, respectively. Revenue from value-added services is recognized within data processing, other and service revenue.
Remaining performance obligations are comprised of deferred revenue and contract revenue that will be invoiced and recognized as revenue in future periods primarily related to value-added services. As of March 31, 2025, the remaining performance obligations were $
4.5
billion. The Company expects approximately half to be recognized as revenue in the next
two years
and the remaining thereafter. However, the amount and timing of revenue recognition is affected by several factors, including contract modifications and terminations, which could impact the estimate of amounts allocated to remaining performance obligations and when such revenue could be recognized.

Note 4—Cash, Cash Equivalents, Restricted Cash and Restricted Cash Equivalents
The Company reconciles cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents reported on the consolidated balance sheets that aggregate to the beginning and ending balances shown in the consolidated statements of cash flows as follows:
Note 5—U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans
U.S. Retrospective Responsibility Plan
Under the terms of the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan, the Company maintains an escrow account from which settlements of, or judgments in, certain litigation (U.S. covered litigation) are paid. The accrual related to the U.S. covered litigation could be either higher or lower than the U.S. litigation escrow account balance. See
Note 13—Legal Matters
.
The following table presents the changes in the U.S. litigation escrow account:
(1)
These payments are associated with the interchange multidistrict litigation. See
Note 13—Legal Matters
.
Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plan
Visa Inc., Visa International and Visa Europe are parties to certain existing and potential litigation relating to the setting of multilateral interchange fee rates in the Visa Europe territory (VE territory covered litigation). Under the terms of the Europe retrospective responsibility plan, the Company is entitled to recover certain losses resulting from VE territory covered litigation (VE territory covered losses) through a periodic adjustment to the class A common stock conversion rates applicable to the series B and C preferred stock. VE territory covered losses are recorded in right to recover for covered losses, a contra-equity account within stockholders’ equity, before the corresponding adjustment to the applicable conversion rate is effected. Adjustments to the conversion rate may be executed once in any six-month period unless a single, individual loss greater than €
20
million is incurred, in which case, the six-month limitation does not apply. When the adjustment to the conversion rate is made, the amount previously recorded in right to recover for covered losses is then recorded against the book value of the preferred stock within stockholders’ equity.

Table of Contents
The following table presents the activities related to VE territory covered losses in the preferred stock and right to recover for covered losses within stockholders’ equity:
(1)
VE territory covered losses reflect litigation provision for settlements with merchants and additional legal costs. See
Note 13—Legal Matters
.
The following table presents the as-converted value of the preferred stock available to recover VE territory covered losses compared to the book value of preferred stock recorded within the Company’s consolidated balance sheets:

Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. As-converted and book values are based on unrounded numbers.
(2)
As of March 31, 2025, the as-converted value of preferred stock is calculated as the product of: (a)
2
million and
3
million shares of the series B and C preferred stock outstanding, respectively; (b)
0.9960
and
1.7830
, the class A common stock conversion rate applicable to the series B and C preferred stock outstanding, respectively; and (c) $
350.46
, Visa’s class A common stock closing stock price.
(3)
As of September 30, 2024, the as-converted value of preferred stock is calculated as the product of: (a)

1.0030
and
1.7860
, the class A common stock conversion rate applicable to the series B and C preferred stock outstanding, respectively; and (c) $
274.95

Note 6—Fair Value Measurements and Investments
Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis
Level 1 assets and liabilities.
Money market funds, U.S. Treasury securities and marketable equity securities are classified as Level 1 within the fair value hierarchy, as fair value is based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. The Company’s deferred compensation liability is measured at fair value based on marketable equity securities held under the deferred compensation plan.
Level 2 assets and liabilities.
The fair value of U.S. government-sponsored debt securities, as provided by third-party pricing vendors, is based on quoted prices in active markets for similar, not identical, assets. Derivative instruments are valued using inputs that are observable in the market or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data.
U.S. Government-sponsored Debt Securities and U.S. Treasury Securities
The amortized cost, unrealized gains and losses and fair value of debt securities were as follows:

Table of Contents
The stated maturities of debt securities were as follows:
Equity Securities
For the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, the Company recognized net unrealized losses of $
23
million for both periods on marketable and non-marketable equity securities held as of period end. For the six months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, the Company recognized net unrealized losses of $
33
million and net unrealized gains of $
13
million, respectively, on marketable and non-marketable equity securities held as of period end.
Fair value measurement alternative.
The Company’s investments in privately held companies do not have readily determinable fair values. These investments are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis and are classified as Level 3 due to the absence of quoted market prices, the inherent lack of liquidity and the fact that significant inputs used to measure fair value are unobservable and require management’s judgment.
The following table summarizes the Company’s non-marketable equity securities held as of period end that were accounted for using the fair value measurement alternative:
Unrealized gains and losses of the Company’s non-marketable equity securities held as of period end that were accounted for using the fair value measurement alternative were as follows:

Other Fair Value Disclosures
Debt.
Debt instruments are measured at amortized cost on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. The fair value of the debt instruments, as provided by third-party pricing vendors, is based on quoted prices in active markets for similar, not identical, instruments. If measured at fair value in the financial statements, these instruments would be classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. As of March 31, 2025, the carrying value and estimated fair value of debt was $
20.8
billion and $
18.7
billion, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, the carrying value and estimated fair value of debt was $
20.8
billion and $
19.2
billion, respectively.
Other financial instruments not measured at fair value.
As of March 31, 2025, the carrying values of settlement receivable and payable and customer collateral are an approximate fair value due to their generally short maturities. If measured at fair value in the financial statements, these instruments would be classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.
Non-financial assets.
Certain non-financial assets such as goodwill, intangible assets and property, equipment and technology are subject to non-recurring fair value measurements if they are deemed to be impaired. The Company performed an annual impairment review of its indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill as of February 1, 2025, and concluded there was
no
impairment as of that date. No recent events or changes in circumstances indicated that impairment existed as of March 31, 2025
.

Note 7—Debt
The Company had outstanding debt as follows:
(1)
Effective interest rates disclosed do not reflect hedge accounting adjustments.
(2)
Represents the fair value of interest rate swap agreements entered into on a portion of the outstanding senior notes.
Note 8—Settlement Guarantee Management
The Company indemnifies its clients for settlement losses suffered due to failure of any other client to fund its settlement obligations in accordance with the Visa operating rules. This indemnification creates settlement risk for the Company due to the difference in timing between the date of a payment transaction and the date of subsequent settlement. The Company maintains and regularly reviews global settlement risk policies and procedures to manage settlement risk, which may require clients to post collateral if certain credit standards are not met. Historically, the Company has experienced minimal losses as a result of its settlement risk guarantee. However, the Company’s future obligations, which could be material under its guarantees, are not determinable as they are dependent upon future events.
18
Table of Contents
The Company’s settlement exposure is limited to the amount of unsettled Visa payment transactions at any point in time, which vary significantly day to day. For the six months ended March 31, 2025, the Company’s maximum daily settlement exposure was $
153.4
billion and the average daily settlement exposure was $
88.4
billion. To mitigate the risk of settlement exposure, the Company has various forms of collateral including restricted cash, letters of credit, guarantees, beneficial rights to trust assets and pledged securities. As of March 31, 2025, the Company had total collateral of $
8.3
billion.

In October 2023, the Company’s board of directors authorized a share repurchase program of $
25.0
billion, providing multi-year flexibility. As of March 31, 2025, the Company’s share repurchase program had remaining authorized funds of $
4.7
billion. All share repurchase programs authorized prior to October 2023 have been completed. In April 2025, the Company’s board of directors authorized a new $
30.0
billion share repurchase program, providing multi-year flexibility. These authorizations have no expiration date.
Dividends.
For the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, the Company declared and paid dividends of $
1,164
million and $
1,060
million, respectively. For the six months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, the Company declared and paid dividends of $
2.3
billion and $
2.1
billion, respectively. On April 29, 2025, the Company’s board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $
0.59
per share of class A common stock (determined in the case of all other outstanding common and preferred stock on an as-converted basis), payable on June 2, 2025 to all holders of record as of May 13, 2025.
Class B common stock.
In January 2024, Visa’s common stockholders approved amendments to the Company’s certificate of incorporation that authorized Visa to implement an exchange offer program that released transfer restrictions on portions of the Company’s class B common stock by allowing holders to exchange a portion of their outstanding shares of class B common stock for shares of freely tradeable class C common stock. The certificate of incorporation amendments automatically redenominated all shares of class B common stock outstanding at the amendment date as class B-1 common stock with no changes to the par value, conversion features, rights or privileges. All references to class B common stock outstanding prior to January 23, 2024 have been updated in this report to class B-1 common stock to reflect this redenomination. The amendments also authorized new classes of class B common stock that will only be issuable in connection with an exchange offer where a preceding class of B common stock is tendered in exchange and retired.

241
million shares of class B-1 common stock tendered in the exchange offer. In exchange, Visa issued approximately
120
million shares of class B-2 common stock and
48
million shares of class C common stock. The class B-1 common shares exchanged have been retired and constitute authorized but unissued shares. Future conversion rate adjustments for the class B-2 common stock will have double the impact compared to conversion rate adjustments for the class B-1 common stock.

Note 12—Income Taxes
For the three and six months ended March 31, 2025, the effective income tax rates were
16
% and
17
%, respectively, and for the three and six months ended March 31, 2024, the effective income tax rates were
15
% and
17
%, respectively. The effective income tax rates differ due to a change in the geographic mix of earnings as well as the following:
•
For the three and six months ended March 31, 2025, a $
222
million tax benefit as a result of a tax position taken on certain expenses, partially offset by a $
71
million tax expense related to the resolution of a tax matter; and
•
For the three and six months ended March 31, 2024, a $
184
million tax benefit as a result of the conclusion of an audit.
For the three and six months ended March 31, 2025, the Company’s gross unrecognized tax benefits increased $
246
million and $
339
million, respectively, and the Company’s net unrecognized tax benefits increased $
88
million and $
100
million, respectively. The change in unrecognized tax benefits is related to various tax positions across several jurisdictions, including an increase in gross timing differences.
The Company’s tax filings are subject to examination by U.S. federal, state and foreign taxing authorities. The timing and outcome of the final resolutions of the various ongoing income tax examinations and refund claims are uncertain. It is not reasonably possible to estimate the increase or decrease in unrecognized tax benefits within the next 12 months.
Note 13—Legal Matters
The Company is a party to various legal and regulatory proceedings. Some of these proceedings involve complex claims that are subject to substantial uncertainties and unascertainable damages. For those proceedings where a loss is determined to be only reasonably possible or probable but not estimable, the Company has disclosed the nature of the claim. Additionally, unless otherwise disclosed below with respect to these proceedings, the Company cannot provide an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss. Although the Company believes that it has strong defenses for the litigation and regulatory proceedings described below, it could, in the future, incur judgments or fines or enter into settlements of claims that could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows. From time to time, the Company may engage in settlement discussions or mediations with respect to one or more of its outstanding litigation matters, either on its own behalf or collectively with other parties.
The litigation accrual is an estimate and is based on management’s understanding of its litigation profile, the specifics of each case, advice of counsel to the extent appropriate and management’s best estimate of incurred loss as of the balance sheet date.
The following table summarizes the activity related to accrued litigation:
Accrual Summary—U.S. Covered Litigation
Visa Inc., Visa U.S.A. and Visa International are parties to certain legal proceedings that are covered by the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan, which the Company refers to as the U.S. covered litigation. An accrual for the U.S. covered litigation and a charge to the litigation provision are recorded when a loss is deemed to be probable
23
Table of Contents
and reasonably estimable. In making this determination, the Company evaluates available information, including but not limited to actions taken by the Company’s litigation committee. The total accrual related to the U.S. covered litigation could be either higher or lower than the escrow account balance. See further discussion below under
U.S. Covered Litigation
and
Note 5—U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans.
The following table summarizes the accrual activity related to U.S. covered litigation:
For the six months ended March 31, 2025, the Company recorded additional accruals of $
1.0
billion and deposited $
375
million into the U.S. litigation escrow account to address claims associated with the interchange multidistrict litigation. The accrual balance is consistent with the Company’s best estimate of its share of a probable and reasonably estimable loss with respect to the U.S. covered litigation. While this estimate is consistent with the Company’s view of the current status of the litigation, the probable and reasonably estimable loss or range of such loss could materially vary based on developments in the litigation. The Company will continue to consider and reevaluate this estimate in light of the substantial uncertainties with respect to the litigation. The Company is unable to estimate a potential loss or range of loss, if any, at trial if negotiated resolutions cannot be reached.
Accrual Summary—VE Territory Covered Litigation
Visa Inc., Visa International and Visa Europe are parties to certain legal proceedings that are covered by the Europe retrospective responsibility plan. Unlike the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan, the Europe retrospective responsibility plan does not have an escrow account that is used to fund settlements or judgments. The Company is entitled to recover VE territory covered losses through periodic adjustments to the class A common stock conversion rates applicable to the series B and C preferred stock. An accrual for the VE territory covered losses and a reduction to stockholders’ equity will be recorded when the loss is deemed to be probable and reasonably estimable. See further discussion below under
VE Territory Covered Litigation

VE Territory Covered Litigation
Europe Merchant Litigation
Since July 2013, proceedings have been commenced by more than
1,150
Merchants (the capitalized term “Merchant”, when used in this section, means a Merchant together with subsidiary/affiliate companies that are party to the same claim) against Visa Europe, Visa Inc. and other Visa subsidiaries in the UK and other countries, primarily relating to interchange rates in Europe and, in some cases, relating to fees charged by Visa and certain Visa rules. They seek damages for alleged anti-competitive conduct in relation to one or more of the following types of interchange fees for credit and debit card transactions: UK domestic, other European domestic, intra-European Economic Area and/or other inter-regional. As of the filing date, Visa has settled the claims asserted by over
950
Merchants, and there are approximately
150
Merchants with outstanding claims. In addition, over
30
Merchants have threatened to commence similar proceedings. Standstill agreements have been entered into with respect to some of those threatened Merchant claims, several of which have been settled. While the amount of interchange being challenged could be substantial, these claims have not yet been filed and their full scope is not yet known. The Company anticipates additional claims in the future.
On December 19, 2024 the UK Court of Appeal issued a decision restricting Merchant damages to
six years
preceding the claim filing. The six-year limitation period will apply to all existing and future Merchant claims brought under English law in the Courts of England and Wales. In April 2025, a trial was completed before the UK Competition Appeal Tribunal regarding the extent to which interchange fees were passed on by acquirers and merchants.

The complaint alleges that defendants violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and SEC Rule 10b-5 in failing to disclose that Visa was in violation of U.S. federal antitrust laws, as was alleged in the lawsuit filed by the U.S. Department of Justice on September 24, 2024 (see
U.S. Department of Justice
matter). The plaintiff seeks a ruling that this case may proceed as a class action, and seeks damages, attorneys’ fees, and costs. On April 23, 2025, the court appointed Cai as lead representative plaintiff.

Between January 31, 2025, and March 27, 2025,
three
shareholder derivative actions were filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. These actions are purportedly brought by shareholders on behalf of Visa Inc. and against certain of its current and former directors and officers. Collectively, the actions assert claims for breach of fiduciary duty and violations of Sections 10(b) and 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 for failing to disclose that Visa was in violation of U.S. federal antitrust laws, as was alleged in the lawsuit filed by the U.S. Department of Justice on September 24, 2024 (see U.S. Department of Justice matter), as well as claims under Sections 20(a) and 21D of the Exchange Act and for unjust enrichment, abuse of control, gross mismanagement, waste of corporate assets, insider trading, and aiding and abetting. Plaintiffs seek monetary damages, corporate governance changes and other equitable relief on behalf of Visa Inc. in addition to attorneys’ fees and costs.
Debit Surcharge Class Action

The complaint claims that Visa has failed to enforce its rules prohibiting merchants from surcharging those transactions, and that plaintiff and putative class members have been harmed as a result. Plaintiff asserts breach of contract, unjust enrichment and unfair competition claims, and seeks monetary damages, declaratory and injunctive relief. On February 13, 2025, Visa filed a motion to dismiss the complaint.

Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers.
(2)
For a full reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP financial results, see tables in
Non-GAAP financial results
below.
Highlights.
For the three and six months ended March 31, 2025, net revenue increased 9% and 10% over the prior-year comparable periods, respectively, primarily due to the growth in processed transactions, nominal cross-border volume and nominal payments volume, partially offset by higher client incentives. For the three and six months ended March 31, 2025, exchange rate movements lowered our net revenue growth by approximately two percentage points and one percentage point, respectively. See
Results of Operations—Net Revenue
below for further discussion.
For the three months ended March 31, 2025, operating expenses increased 22% over the prior-year comparable period, primarily driven by higher litigation provision. For the six months ended March 31, 2025, operating expenses increased 22% over the prior-year comparable period, primarily driven by higher litigation provision and personnel expense. See
Results of Operations—Operating Expenses
below for further discussion. For the three and six months ended March 31, 2025, exchange rate movements lowered our operating expense growth by approximately two percentage points and one percentage point, respectively.
For the three months ended March 31, 2025, non-GAAP operating expenses increased 7% over the prior-year comparable period, primarily driven by higher personnel, marketing, and depreciation and amortization expenses. For the six months ended March 31, 2025, non-GAAP operating expenses increased 9% over the prior-year comparable period, primarily driven by higher personnel, general and administrative, and depreciation and amortization expenses.
Acquisition.
In December 2024, we acquired Featurespace Limited (Featurespace), a developer of real-time artificial intelligence payments protection technology that prevents and mitigates payments fraud and financial crime risks, for a purchase consideration of $946 million. See
Note 2—Acquisitions
to our unaudited consolidated financial statements.
Interchange multidistrict litigation
. For the six months ended March 31, 2025, we recorded additional accruals of $1.0 billion to address claims associated with the interchange multidistrict litigation. We also made deposits of $375 million into the U. S. litigation escrow account. The additional accruals related to the interchange multidistrict litigation could be higher or lower than deposits made into the U.S. litigation escrow account. See

Common stock repurchases.
For the six months ended March 31, 2025, we repurchased 26 million shares of our class A common stock in the open market for $8.4 billion. As of March 31, 2025, our share repurchase program had remaining authorized funds of $4.7 billion. In April 2025, our board of directors authorized a new $30.0 billion share repurchase program, providing multi-year flexibility. See
Note 9—Stockholders’ Equity
to our unaudited consolidated financial statements.
Non-GAAP financial results.
We use non-GAAP financial measures of our performance which exclude certain items which we believe are not representative of our continuing operations, as they may be non-recurring or have no cash impact, and may distort our longer-term operating trends. We consider non-GAAP measures useful to investors because they provide greater transparency into management’s view and assessment of our ongoing operating performance.
•
Gains and losses on equity investments.
Gains and losses on equity investments include periodic non-cash fair value adjustments and gains and losses upon sale of an investment.
These long-term investments are strategic in nature and are primarily private company investments. Gains and losses associated with these investments are tied to the performance of the
companies that we invest in
and therefore do not correlate to the underlying performance of our business.
•
Amortization of acquired intangible assets.
Amortization of acquired intangible assets consists of amortization of intangible assets such as technology and customer relationships acquired in connection with business combinations executed beginning in fiscal 2019. Amortization charges for our acquired intangible assets are non-cash and are significantly affected by the timing, frequency and size of our acquisitions, rather than our core operations. As such, we have excluded this amount to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and comparison to our past operating performance.
•
Acquisition-related costs.
Acquisition-related costs consist primarily of one-time transaction and integration costs associated with our business combinations. These costs include professional fees, technology integration fees, restructuring activities and other direct costs related to the purchase and integration of acquired entities. These costs also include retention equity and deferred compensation when they are agreed upon as part of the purchase price of the transaction but are required to be recognized as expense post-combination. We have excluded these amounts as the expenses are recognized for a limited duration and do not reflect the underlying performance of our business.
•
Severance costs.
For the six months ended March 31, 2025, we recorded severance costs within personnel expense to realign our organizational structure and focus on areas that will drive higher long-term growth. This broad-based optimization effort has been excluded as it is not representative of our ongoing operations.
•
Lease consolidation costs.
For the six months ended March 31, 2025, and three and six months ended March 31, 2024, we recorded charges within general and administrative expense associated with the consolidation of certain leased office spaces. We have excluded these amounts as it does not reflect the underlying performance of our business.
•
Litigation provision.
Litigation provision includes significant accruals related to certain legal matters that are not covered by the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan or the Europe retrospective responsibility plan (uncovered legal matters) and additional accruals associated with the interchange multidistrict litigation which are covered by the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan (U.S. covered litigation). Litigation provision associated with these matters can vary significantly based on the facts and circumstances related to each matter and do not correlate to the underlying performance of our business. For the three and six months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, we have excluded these amounts to facilitate a comparison to our past operating performance.
Under the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan, we recover the monetary liabilities related to the U.S. covered litigation through a downward adjustment to the rate at which shares of our class B-1 and class B-2 common stock ultimately convert into shares of class A common stock. For the three and six months ended March 31, 2025, basic and diluted earnings per class A common stock was unchanged. For the three and six months ended March 31, 2024, there was no conversion rate adjustment. See
Note 5—U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans

Payments volume and processed transactions.
Payments volume is the primary driver for our service revenue, and the number of processed transactions is the primary driver for our data processing revenue.
Payments
volume represents the aggregate dollar amount of purchases made with cards and other form factors carrying the Visa, Visa Electron, V PAY and Interlink brands and excludes Europe co-badged volume. Nominal payments volume is denominated in U.S. dollars and is calculated each quarter by applying an established U.S. dollar/foreign currency exchange rate for each local currency in which our volumes are reported.
Processed transactions include payments and cash transactions, and represent transactions using cards and other form factors carrying the Visa, Visa Electron, V PAY, Interlink and PLUS brands processed on Visa’s networks.

Service revenue in a given quarter is primarily assessed based on nominal payments volume in the prior quarter. Therefore, service revenue reported for the three and six months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively, was based on nominal payments volume reported by our financial institution clients for the three and six months ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. On occasion, previously presented volume information may be updated. Prior period updates are not material.

(1)
Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers.
Net revenue increased over the three and six-month prior-year comparable periods primarily due to the growth in processed transactions, nominal cross-border volume and nominal payments volume, partially offset by higher client incentives.
Our net revenue is impacted by the overall strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar as payments volume and related revenue denominated in local currencies are converted to U.S. dollars. For the three and six months ended March 31, 2025, exchange rate movements lowered our net revenue growth by approximately two percentage points and one percentage point, respectively.
The following table presents the components of our net revenue:
(1)
Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers.
•
Service revenue
increased over the three and six-month prior-year comparable periods primarily due to growth in nominal payments volume of 7%.
•

•
International transaction revenue
increased over the three and six-month prior-year comparable periods primarily due to growth in nominal cross-border volumes of 10% and 12%, respectively, excluding transactions within Europe.
•
Other revenue
increased over the three and six-month prior-year comparable periods primarily due to growth in advisory and other services and select pricing modifications.
•
Client incentives
increased over the three and six-month prior-year comparable periods primarily due to growth in payments volume. The amount of client incentives we record in future periods will vary based on changes in performance expectations, actual client performance, amendments to existing contracts or the execution of new contracts.
For the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, revenue from value-added services was $2.6 billion and $2.1 billion, respectively. For the six months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, revenue from value-added services was $5.0 billion and $4.2 billion, respectively. Value-added services revenue increased 23% and 20% over the three and six-month prior-year comparable periods, respectively, primarily due to growth in issuing solutions, advisory and other services and acceptance solutions.
Operating Expenses

Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers.
•
Personnel expenses
increased over the three and six-month prior-year comparable periods primarily due to a higher number of employees and compensation focused on areas that will drive higher long-term growth, including acquisitions. The increase over the six-month prior-year comparable period was also due to severance costs in the current period to realign our organizational structure.
•
Marketing expenses
increased over the three and six-month prior-year comparable periods primarily due to higher spending in various campaigns, including for client marketing.
•
Network and processing expenses
increased over the three and six-month prior-year comparable periods primarily due to continued technology and processing network investments to support growth and acquisitions.
•
Depreciation and amortization expenses
increased over the three and six-month prior-year comparable periods primarily due to additional amortization and depreciation from our on-going investments and acquisitions.
34
Table of Contents
•
General and administrative expenses
decreased over the three-month prior-year comparable period primarily due to the absence of lease consolidation costs and favorable foreign currency fluctuations, partially offset by higher usage of travel related card benefits and higher indirect taxes. General and administrative expenses increased over the six-month prior-year comparable period primarily due to higher usage of travel related card benefits and higher indirect taxes, partially offset by lower lease consolidation costs.
•
Litigation provision
increased over the three and six-month prior-year comparable periods primarily due to higher accruals related to the U.S. covered litigation, partially offset by lower accruals related to uncovered litigation. See
Note 13—Legal Matters

(1)
Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers.

Interest expense
increased over the three and six-month prior-year comparable periods primarily due to lower interest benefit related to taxes partially offset by lower losses from derivative instruments.
•
Investment income (expense) and other
decreased over the three and six-month prior-year comparable periods primarily due to lower interest income on our cash and investments and losses on our equity investments.
Effective Income Tax Rate
The following table presents our effective income tax rates:
The effective income tax rates for the three and six-month prior-year comparable periods differ due to a change in the geographic mix of earnings as well as the following:
•
For the three and six months ended March 31, 2025, a $222 million tax benefit as a result of a tax position taken on certain expenses, partially offset by a $71 million tax expense related to the resolution of a tax matter; and
•
For the three and six months ended March 31, 2024, a $184 million tax benefit as a result of the conclusion of an audit.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) published administrative guidance around the implementation of a 15% global minimum tax (Pillar Two). Various OECD member countries have either enacted or are in the process of enacting Pillar Two legislation. While we do not expect a material tax impact in fiscal 2025, we are monitoring developments and evaluating the potential impact of Pillar Two on future years.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
Cash Flow Data
The following table summarizes our cash flow activity for the periods presented:
Operating activities.
Cash provided by operating activities increased over the six-month prior-year comparable period primarily due to growth in our underlying business and the timing of payments related to income taxes.
Investing activities.
Cash provided by investing activities increased over the six-month prior-year comparable period primarily due to the absence of investment security purchases.
Financing activities.
Cash used in financing activities increased over the six-month prior-year comparable period primarily due to higher share repurchases, lower funds held on behalf of clients and higher dividends paid.
Sources of Liquidity
Our primary sources of liquidity are cash on hand, cash flow from our operations, our investment portfolio and access to various equity and borrowing arrangements. Funds from operations are maintained in cash and cash equivalents and short-term or long-term investment securities based upon our funding requirements, access to liquidity from these holdings and the returns that these holdings provide. Based on our current cash flow budgets and forecasts of our short-term and long-term liquidity needs, we believe that our current and projected sources of liquidity will be sufficient to meet our projected liquidity needs for more than the next 12 months. We will continue to assess our liquidity position and potential sources of supplemental liquidity in view of our operating performance, current economic and capital market conditions and other relevant circumstances.
Uses of Liquidity
There has been no significant change to our primary uses of liquidity since September 30, 2024, except as discussed below.
Common stock repurchases.
For the six months ended March 31, 2025, we repurchased
shares
of our class A common stock in the open market for $8.4 billion. As of March 31, 2025, our share repurchase program had remaining authorized funds of $4.7 billion. In April 2025, our board of directors authorized a new $30.0 billion share repurchase program, providing multi-year flexibility. See
Note 9—Stockholders’ Equity
to our unaudited consolidated financial statements.
Dividends
. For the six months ended March 31, 2025, we declared and paid $2.3 billion in dividends to holders of our common and preferred stock. On April 29, 2025, our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.59 per share of class A common stock (determined in the case of all other outstanding common and preferred stock on an as-converted basis). We expect to continue paying quarterly dividends in cash, subject to approval by the board of directors. See
Note 9—Stockholders’ Equity
to our unaudited consolidated financial statements.
Senior notes.
A
principal payment on our senior notes of $4.0 billion is due in December 2025 for which we have sufficient liquidity. See
Note 7—Debt
to our unaudited consolidated financial statements.
Acquisition
. In December 2024, we acquired Featurespace for a purchase consideration of $946 million. See

Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted
In November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2023-07, which is intended to
improve reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expense
s. This standard also enhances interim disclosure requirements and provides new segment disclosure requirements for entities with a single reportable segment. This ASU is effective for our annual periods beginning October 1, 2024, and interim periods beginning October 1, 2025, and requires
retrospective application to all prior periods presented.
The adoption of this ASU is expected to result in additional disclosures.
In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, which provides improvements to income tax disclosures. This standard requires disaggregated information related to the effective tax rate reconciliation as well as information on income taxes paid. This ASU is effective for our annual periods beginning October 1, 2025, and requires prospective application with the option to apply the standard retrospectively. We are currently evaluating the impact of the ASU on our disclosures.
In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03, which requires disclosure of additional information about specific expense categories underlying certain income statement expense line items. Subsequently, the FASB also issued an amendment to this standard. The amendments in the ASU are effective for our annual periods beginning October 1, 2027, and interim periods beginning October 1, 2028, and require either prospective or retrospective application. We are currently evaluating the impact of the ASU on our disclosures.
There have been no significant changes to our market risks since September 30, 2024.
Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures.
Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) at the end of the period covered by this report and, based on such evaluation, have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of such date.
Changes in internal control over financial reporting.
There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our second quarter of fiscal 2025 that have materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.
