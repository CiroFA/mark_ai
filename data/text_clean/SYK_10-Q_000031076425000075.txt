NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited)
NOTE 1 -
BASIS OF PRESENTATION
General Information
Management believes the accompanying unaudited Consolidated
Financial Statements contain all adjustments, including normal
recurring items, considered necessary to fairly present the
financial position of Stryker Corporation and its consolidated
subsidiaries ("Stryker," the "Company," "we," "us" or "our") on
March 31, 2025
and the results of operations for the
three
months 2025
. The results of operations included in these
Consolidated Financial Statements may not necessarily be
indicative of our annual results. These statements should be read
in conjunction with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for
2024
.
New Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted
In November 2024 the Financial Accounting Standards Board
(FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2024-03
(Subtopic 220-40):
Income Statement - Reporting
Comprehensive Income - Expense Disaggregation Disclosures
which requires disaggregation of certain expense captions into
specified categories in disclosures within the Notes to the
Consolidated Financial Statements. The new disclosure
requirements are effective for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2026 and interim periods within fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2027. Early adoption is permitted.
We are currently evaluating these new expanded disclosure
requirements.
In December 2023 the FASB issued ASU 2023-09 (Topic 740):
Income Taxes: Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures
which
expands the existing rules on income tax disclosures. This
update requires entities to disclose specific categories in the tax
rate reconciliation, provide additional information for reconciling
items that meet a quantitative threshold and disclose additional
information about income taxes paid on an annual basis. The
new disclosure requirements are effective for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2024 and
we will adopt this ASU in
the fourth quarter 2025
.
We evaluate all ASUs issued by the FASB for consideration of
their applicability. ASUs not included in our disclosures were
assessed and determined to be either not applicable or are not
expected to have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial
Statements.
NOTE 2 -
REVENUE RECOGNITION
Our policies for recognizing sales have not changed from those
described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for
2024
.
We disaggregate our net sales by business and geographic
location for each of our segments as we believe it best depicts
how the nature, amount, timing and certainty of our net sales and
cash flows are affected by economic factors.
In the first quarter
2025
we changed the name of our
Neurovascular business to Vascular due the acquisition of Inari
Medical, Inc. (Inari).
In the fourth quarter
2024
we reorganized our Spine business to
align with certain updates to our internal reporting structure. The
spine enabling technologies portfolio (Enabling Technologies)
was reclassified to Other Orthopaedics and Spine, the
interventional spine (IVS) portfolio was reclassified to Neuro
Cranial
and the remaining Spine business was renamed to Spinal
Implants
. In addition we changed the name of our “Orthopaedics
and Spine” operating segment to “Orthopaedics.”
Neuro Cranial
includes sales related to
IVS
of
$
118
and
$
98
for the
three
months
2025
and
2024
. Other Orthopaedics includes sales
related to Enabling Technologies of
$
29
and
$
31
for the
three
months
2025
and
2024
. We have reflected these changes in all
historical periods presented.
Costs to Obtain or Fulfill a Contract
We typically do not incur costs to fulfill a contract before a
product or service is provided to a customer due to the nature of
our products and services. Our costs to obtain contracts are
typically in the form of sales commissions paid to employees or
third-party agents. Certain sales commissions paid to employees
prior to recognition of sales are recorded as deferred contract
costs. We expense sales commissions associated with obtaining
a contract at the time of the sale or as incurred as the
amortization period is generally less than one year. These costs
have been presented within selling, general and administrative
expenses. On
March 31, 2025
and
December 31, 2024
deferred
contracts costs recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheets
were not significant.
Contract Assets and Liabilities
Our contract assets primarily relate to conditional rights to
consideration for work completed but not billed at the reporting
date.
On
March 31, 2025
and
December 31, 2024
contract
assets recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheets were not
significant.
Our contract liabilities arise as a result of consideration received
from customers at inception of contracts for certain businesses or
where the timing of billing for services precedes satisfaction of
our performance obligations. This occurs primarily when payment
is received upfront for certain multi-period extended service
contracts. Our contract liabilities of
$
1,028
and
$
978
on
March 31, 2025
and
December 31, 2024
are classified within
accrued expenses and other liabilities and other noncurrent
liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets based on the timing
of when we expect to complete our performance obligations.
Changes in contract liabilities during the
three months 2025
were
as follows:
Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets
We sell certain customer lease agreements and the related
leased assets to third-party financial institutions to accelerate our
cash collection cycle. The lease receivables are sold without
recourse and are derecognized from our Consolidated Balance
Sheets at the time of sale. Under the terms of our arrangements,
we collect lease payments on behalf of the financial institutions
but maintain no other form of continuing involvement. Sales of
these lease agreements are classified as operating activities in
our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Fees earned for our
servicing activities are immaterial. Revenue related to customer
lease agreements sold under these arrangements represented
less than
4
%
of our total revenue for the
three months
2025
and
2024
.
NOTE 3 -
ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE (LOSS)
INCOME (AOCI)
NOTE 4 -
DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS
We use operational and economic hedges, foreign currency
exchange forward contracts, net investment hedges (both
derivative and non-derivative financial instruments) and interest
rate derivative instruments to manage the impact of currency
exchange and interest rate fluctuations on earnings, cash flow
and equity. We do not enter into derivative instruments for
speculative purposes. We are exposed to potential credit loss in
the event of nonperformance by counterparties on our
outstanding derivative instruments but do not anticipate
nonperformance by any of our counterparties. Should a
counterparty default, our maximum loss exposure is the asset
balance of the instrument. We have not changed our hedging
strategies, accounting practices or objectives from those
disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for
2024
.
We had
€
2.3
billion
at
March 31, 2025
and
December 31, 2024
in
certain forward currency contracts designated as net investment
hedges,
for which the maximum term is
9
.5 years
,
to hedge a
portion of our investments in certain of our entities with functional
currencies denominated in Euros. In addition to these derivative
financial instruments designated as net investment hedges, we
had
€
5.0
billion
at
March 31, 2025
and
December 31, 2024
of
senior unsecured notes designated as net investment hedges to
selectively hedge portions of our investment in certain
international subsidiaries. The currency effects of our Euro-
denominated senior unsecured notes are reflected in AOCI within
shareholders' equity where they offset gains and losses recorded
on our net investment in international subsidiaries.
The total after-tax gain (loss) recognized in OCI related to
designated net investment hedges was
($
218
)
in the
three
months 2025
.
Currency Exchange Rate Gains (Losses) Recognized in Net
Earnings
Pretax gains (losses) on derivatives designated as cash flow
hedges of
$
13
and net investment hedges of
$
40
recorded in
AOCI are expected to be reclassified to cost of sales and other
income (expense), net in earnings within 12 months of
March 31,
2025
.
This cash flow hedge reclassification is primarily due to the
sale of inventory that includes previously hedged purchases. A
component of the AOCI amounts related to net investment
hedges is reclassified over the life of the hedge instruments as
we elected to exclude the initial value of the component related to
the spot-forward difference from the effectiveness assessment.
Interest Rate Hedges
Pretax gains (losses) of
$
3
recorded in AOCI related to interest
rate hedges closed in conjunction with debt issuances are
expected to be reclassified to other income (expense), net in
earnings within 12 months of
March 31, 2025
.
The cash flow
effect of interest rate hedges is recorded in cash flow from
operations.
NOTE 5 -
FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS
Our policies for managing risk related to foreign currency, interest
rates, credit and markets and our process for determining fair
value have not changed from those described in our Annual
Report on Form 10-K for
2024
.
In the
three months 2025
we assumed contingent consideration
liabilities with a fair value of
$
90
related to previous acquisitions
made by Inari Medical Inc. (Inari). Refer to Note 7 for further
information on the acquisition of Inari.
In
2024
we recorded
$
208
of contingent consideration related to
various acquisitions described in Note 7.
There were no significant transfers into or out of any level of the
fair value hierarchy in
2025
.
On
March 31, 2025
and
December 31, 2024
the aggregate
difference between the cost and fair value of available-for-sale
marketable securities was nominal. Interest income on cash and
cash equivalents and short-term investments and income from
marketable securities was
$
38
and
$
36
in the
three months
2025
and
2024
, which was recorded in other income (expense), net.
O
ur investments in available-for-sale marketable securities had a
minimum credit quality rating of A2 (Moody's), A (Standard &
Poor's) and A (Fitch). We do not plan to sell the investments, and
it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the
investments before recovery of their amortized cost basis, which
may be maturity.
NOTE 6 -
CONTINGENCIES AND COMMITMENTS
We are involved in various ongoing proceedings, legal actions
and claims arising in the normal course of business, including
proceedings related to product, labor, intellectual property and
other matters, the most significant of which are more fully
described below. The outcomes of these matters will generally
not be known for prolonged periods of time. In certain of the legal
proceedings the claimants seek damages as well as other
compensatory and equitable relief that could result in the
payment of significant claims and settlements and/or the
imposition of injunctions or other equitable relief. For legal
matters for which management had sufficient information to
reasonably estimate our future obligations, a liability representing
management's best estimate of the probable loss, or the
minimum of the range of probable losses when a best estimate
within the range is not known, is recorded. The estimates are
based on consultation with legal counsel, previous settlement
experience and settlement strategies. If actual outcomes are less
favorable than those estimated by management, additional
expense may be incurred, which could unfavorably affect future
operating results. We are self-insured for certain claims and
expenses. The ultimate cost to us with respect to product liability
claims could be materially different than the amount of the current
estimates and accruals and could have a material adverse effect
on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
We are currently investigating whether certain business activities
in certain foreign countries violated provisions of the Foreign
Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and have engaged outside counsel
to conduct these investigations. We have been contacted by the
United States Securities and Exchange Commission, United
States Department of Justice (DOJ) and certain other regulatory
authorities and are cooperating with these agencies. On April 1,
2025 we were informed by the DOJ that it had closed its inquiry
into potential FCPA violations without further action. At this time
we are unable to predict the outcome of the remaining
investigations or the potential impact, if any, on our financial
statements.
We have conducted voluntary recalls of certain products,
including our Rejuvenate and ABG II Modular-Neck hip stems
and certain lot-specific sizes and offsets of LFIT Anatomic CoCr
V40 Femoral Heads. Additionally, we are responsible for certain
product liability claims, primarily related to certain hip products
sold by Wright Medical Group N.V. (Wright) prior to its 2014
divestiture of the OrthoRecon business.
We have incurred, and expect to incur in the future, costs
associated with the defense and settlement of claims and
lawsuits. Based on the information that has been received related
to the matters discussed above, our accrual for these matters
was
$
169
at
March 31, 2025
, representing our best estimate of
probable loss. The final outcomes of these matters are
dependent on many factors that are difficult to predict.
Accordingly the ultimate cost related to these matters may be
materially different than the amount of our current estimate and
accruals and could have a material adverse effect on our results
of operations and cash flows.
Other Contractual Obligations and Commitments
Our outstanding balances of confirmed invoices in the supplier
financing program were
$
66
and
$
71
at
March 31, 2025
and
December 31, 2024
and are included within
accounts payable
in
our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
NOTE 7 -
ACQUISITIONS
We acquire stock in companies and various assets that continue
to support our capital deployment and product development
strategies. In the
three months
2025
and
2024
cash paid for
acquisitions, net of cash acquired was
$
4,749
and
$
246
.
In February
2025
we completed the acquisition of Inari for
$
80
per share, or an aggregate purchase price of
$
4,745
, net of cash
acquired. Inari's product portfolio includes minimally invasive
products for the treatment of venous thromboembolism. Inari is
part of our Vascular business within MedSurg and
Neurotechnology. The purchase price allocation for Inari is based
on preliminary valuations, primarily related to developed
technology and customer relationships. Goodwill attributable to
the acquisition reflects the strategic benefits of expanding our
market presence, diversifying our product portfolio and advancing
innovations. This goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes
.
Share-based awards for Inari employees vested upon our
acquisition and a charge of
$
139
was recorded in selling, general
and administrative expenses in the
three months
2025
.
In 2024
we completed various acquisitions for total consideration
that includes
$
1,628
in upfront payments, net of cash acquired,
and
$
400
contingent upon the achievement of certain commercial
or clinical milestones. The combined acquisition-date fair values
of the contingent milestone payments totaled
$
208
. Goodwill of
$
304
and
$
858
was recorded within our Orthopaedics and our
MedSurg and Neurotechnology segments respectively. The
acquired companies expand the product portfolios of our
Instruments, Endoscopy, Medical and Neuro Cranial businesses
within MedSurg and Neurotechnology and our Trauma and
Extremities and Joint Replacement within Orthopaedics. The
purchase price allocation for our acquisitions are based on
preliminary valuations, primarily related to developed technology
and customer relationships. Goodwill attributable to the
acquisitions reflects the strategic benefits of e
xpanding our
market presence
, diversifying our product portfolio and advancing
innovations. This goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes.
The purchase price
allocations
for the acquisitions completed in
the
three months
2025
and full year
2024
are:
The purchase price allocation for
SERF SAS
was finalized in the
first quarter
2025
without material adjustments.
NOTE 8 -
DEBT AND CREDIT FACILITIES
We have lines of credit issued by various financial institutions that
are available to fund our day-to-day operating needs. Certain of
our credit facilities require us to comply with financial and other
covenants. We were in compliance with all covenants on
March 31, 2025
.
In February 2025 we entered into a new revolving credit
agreement that replaces our previous agreement dated October
2021.
The primary changes included increasing the aggregate
principal amount of the facility by
$
750
to
$
3,000
and extending
the maturity date to February 25, 2030.
On
March 31, 2025
there
were
no
borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility
or our commercial paper program which allows for maturities up
to
397
days from the date of issuance. The maximum amount of
our commercial paper that can be outstanding at any time is
$
2,250
.
In February
2025
we issued
$
500
of
4.550
%
senior unsecured
notes due February 10, 2027,
$
700
of
4.700
%
senior unsecured
notes due February 10, 2028,
$
800
of
4.850
%
senior unsecured
notes due February 10, 2030 and
$
1,000
of
5.200
%
senior
unsecured notes due February 10, 2035.
The fair value of the senior unsecured notes was estimated using
quoted interest rates, maturities and amounts of borrowings
based on quoted active market prices and yields that took into
account the underlying terms of the debt instruments.
Substantially all of our debt is classified within Level 2 of the fair
value hierarchy.
NOTE 9 -
INCOME TAXES
Our effective tax rates were
14.4
%
and
14.6
%
in the
three
months
2025
and
2024
. The effective tax rates for the
three
months
2025
and
2024
reflect the continued lower effective
income tax rates as a result of our European operations and
certain discrete tax items.
In the normal course of business, income tax authorities in
various income tax jurisdictions both within the United States and
internationally conduct routine audits of our income tax returns
filed in prior years. These audits are generally designed to
determine if individual income tax authorities are in agreement
with our interpretations of complex income tax regulations
regarding the allocation of income to the various income tax
jurisdictions. Any income tax audit assessment or draft income
tax audit assessment received at the conclusion of an audit is
reviewed and evaluated for proper financial statement treatment.
We have not received any audit assessments or draft
assessments that have not been reviewed and evaluated.
NOTE 10 -
SEGMENT
INFORMATION
We segregate our operations into
two
reportable business
segments: (i) MedSurg and Neurotechnology and (ii)
Orthopaedics which aligns to our internal reporting structure and
how our Chief Operating Decision Maker (
CODM)
assesses the
performance of and allocates resources. The CODM is the Chief
Executive Officer. The CODM makes decisions on resource
allocation, assesses performance of the business, and monitors
budget versus actual results using segment operating income.
Our reportable segments and related disclosures reflect certain
reclassifications of prior year amounts from our Orthopaedics
segment to our MedSurg and Neurotechnology segment due to
changes in our internal reporting structure.
NOTE 11 -
ASSETS HELD FOR SALE
During the fourth quarter 2024 management committed to a plan
to sell certain assets associated with the Spinal Implants
business (disposal group) and such assets were classified as
held for sale beginning November 2024. As a result we recorded
a valuation allowance of
$
362
to record the disposal group at its
fair value less cost to sell. In January 2025 we announced a
definitive agreement to sell our United States Spinal Implants
business to Viscogliosi Brothers, LLC. The definitive agreement
includes a binding offer to sell our Spinal Implants business in
certain international markets at later dates, subject to required
consultations with employees and employee representatives.
In the
three months
2025
we recognized a charge of
$
33
to
record the disposal group at its fair value less cost to sell within
goodwill and other impairments in our Consolidated Statements
of Earnings resulting in a valuation allowance o
f
$
395
at
March 31, 2025
. The fair value of the disposal group was
measured using a discounted cash flow analysis based upon the
selling price and unobservable inputs, such as market conditions
and the rate used to discount the estimated future cash flows to
their present value based on factors including the disposal
group’s cost of equity and market yield rates, which are Level 3
inputs. Future changes in the judgments, assumptions and
estimates that are used in our fair value estimate, including
discount rates and cash flow projections, could result in a
significantly different estimate of fair value. A change in the
amount or timing of consideration received could increase the fair
value by
up to
$
57
or decrease the fair value by up to
$
245
.
In April 2025 we completed the sale of our United States Spinal
Implants business as discussed in Note 12.
The assets associated with the Spinal Implants disposal group
are reported in our Orthopaedics segment.
The assets and
liabilities held for sale are classified within prepaid expenses and
other current assets and accrued expenses and other liabilities in
our Consolidated Balance Sheets and included the following at
March 31, 2025
and
December 31, 2024
:
NOTE 12 -
SUBSEQUENT EVENT
In April 2025 we completed the sale of our United States Spinal
Implants business to the Viscogliosi Brothers, LLC. The definitive
agreement includes a binding offer to sell our Spinal Implants
business in certain international markets at later dates, subject to
the completion of all legal and regulatory requirements and
required consultations with employees and employee
representatives.

offer innovative products and services in MedSurg,
Neurotechnology, and
Orthopaedics
that help improve patient
and healthcare outcomes. Alongside our customers around the
world, we impact more than 150 million patients annually.
We segregate our operations into two reportable business
segments: (i) MedSurg and Neurotechnology and (ii)
Orthopaedics. MedSurg and Neurotechnology products include
surgical equipment and navigation systems (Instruments),
endoscopic and communications systems (Endoscopy), patient
handling, emergency medical equipment and intensive care
disposable products (Medical),
minimally invasive products for
the treatment of acute ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke and
venous thromboembolism (Vascular)
, a comprehensive line of
products for traditional brain and open skull based surgical
procedures; orthobiologic and biosurgery products, including
synthetic bone grafts and vertebral augmentation products
(Neuro Cranial). Orthopaedics products consist primarily of
implants used in hip and knee joint replacements and trauma and
extremity surgeries.
Macroeconomic Environment
Beginning in the first quarter 2025, the United States government
has announced new tariffs on goods imported into the United
States from dozens of countries, including China and the
European Union member states. In response, governments have
threatened or imposed reciprocal tariffs or taken other measures,
and the United States is in the process of negotiating with certain
governments. We continue to monitor and evaluate the situation.
Tariffs could result in an increase in certain product costs or have
adverse impacts on, among other things, demand for our
products and supply chains. The overall macroeconomic and
geopolitical environment, including tariffs or changes in trade
policies, slower economic growth or recession, market volatility
and inflation, and uncertainty regarding all of the foregoing, pose
risks that could impact our business and results of operations.
For more information about these risks, see Item 1A. "Risk
Factors" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for 2024.

2024
. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures,
sales grew
10.1%
in constant currency. We reported operating
income margin of
14.3%
, net earnings of
$654

nm - not meaningful
Note: In the first quarter
2025
we changed the name of our Neurovascular business to Vascular due the acquisition of Inari.
In the fourth
quarter
2024
we reorganized our Spine business to align with certain updates to our internal reporting structure. The spine enabling
technologies portfolio (Enabling Technologies) was reclassified to Other Orthopaedics, the interventional spine portfolio was reclassified
to Neuro Cranial and the remaining Spine business was renamed to Spinal Implants. Neuro Cranial includes sales related to
interventional spine of
$118
and
$98
for
three months
2025
and
2024
. Other Orthopaedics includes sales related to Enabling
Technologies of
$29
and
$31
for
three months
2025
and
2024
. We have reflected these changes in all historical periods presented.
Consolidated
Net Sales
In the fourth quarter 2024 we reorganized our Spine business to
align with certain updates to our internal reporting structure. The
spine enabling technologies portfolio (Enabling Technologies)
was reclassified to Other Orthopaedics, the Interventional Spine
(IVS) portfolio was reclassified to Neuro Cranial and the
remaining Spine business was renamed to Spinal Implants.
Consolidated net sales
increased
11.9%
in the
three months
2025
as reported and
12.8%
in constant currency, as foreign
currency exchange rates
negatively
impacted net sales by
0.9%
.
Excluding the
2.7%
impact of acquisitions and divestitures, net
sales in constant currency
increased
by
9.4%
from
increased
unit
volume
and
0.7%
due to
higher
prices. The unit volume
increase
was due to
higher
product shipments across all MedSurg and
Neurotechnology businesses and
most Orthopaedics businesses
.
MedSurg and Neurotechnology Net Sales
MedSurg and Neurotechnology net sales
increased
13.4%
in the
three months
2025
as reported and
14.2%
in constant currency,
as foreign currency exchange rates
negatively
impacted net sales
by
0.8%
. Excluding the
3.5%
impact of acquisitions and
divestitures, net sales in constant currency
increased
by
9.5%
from
increased
unit volume
and
1.2%
from
higher
prices. The unit
volume
increase
was due to
higher
shipments across all
MedSurg and Neurotechnology businesses.
Orthopaedics Net Sales
Orthopaedics net sales
increased
9.7%
in the
three months
2025
as reported and
10.7%
in constant currency, as foreign currency
exchange rates
negatively
impacted net sales by
1.0%
. Excluding
the
1.4%
impact of acquisitions and divestitures, net sales in
constant currency
increased
9.3%
from
increased
unit volume.
The unit volume
increase
was due to
higher
shipments across
most Orthopaedics businesses.
Gross Profit
Gross profit was
$3,744
and
$3,333
in the
three months
2025
and
2024
. The key components of the change were:
Gross profit as a percentage of net sales in the
three months
2025
remained relatively flat with
2024
.
While segment mix was not a significant driver of the change in
gross profit as a percent of net sales between the
three months
2025
and
2024
, we generally expect segment mix to have an
unfavorable impact for the foreseeable future as we anticipate
more rapid sales growth in our lower gross margin MedSurg and
Neurotechnology segment than our Orthopaedics
segment
.
Research, Development and Engineering Expenses
Research, development and engineering expenses
increased
$37
or
10.1%
in the
three months
2025
. Expenses
as a
percentage of net sales in
the
three months
2025
of
6.9%
remained relatively flat with
7.0%
in
2024
.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses
Selling, general and administrative expenses
increased
$463
or
25.2%
in the
three months
2025
. As a percentage of net sales,
expenses
increased
to
39.2%
from
35.0%
in
2024
,
primarily
due
to higher acquisition-related costs and
continued investments to
support our growth. Expenses in the
three months
2025
included
a charge of
$139
for share-based awards for Inari employees that
vested upon our acquisition.
Amortization of Intangible Assets
Amortization of intangible assets was
$167
and
$153
in the
three
months
2025
and
2024
. Refer to Note 7 to our Consolidated
Financial Statements for further information.
Goodwill and other impairments
Goodwill and other impairments was
$35
and
$3
in the
three
months
2025
and
2024
. Refer to Note 11 to our Consolidated
Financial Statements for further information on impairment
charges related to assets held for sale at
March 31, 2025
.
Operating Income
Operating income was
$837
and
$972
in the
three months
2025
and
2024
. Operating income as a percentage of net sales in the
three months
2025
decreased
to
14.3%
from
18.5%
in
2024
.
Refer to the discussion above for the primary drivers of the
change.
MedSurg and Neurotechnology operating income as a
percentage of net sales
increased
to
27.6%
in the
three months
2025
from
27.3%
in
2024
. Orthopaedics operating income as a
percentage of net sales
increased
to
27.2%
in the
three months
2025
from
26.2%
in
2024
. The key components of the change
were:
The
increase
in MedSurg and Neurotechnology operating income
as a percentage of net sales for the
three months
was primarily
driven by
lower
manufacturing and supply chain costs and
higher
unit volumes and prices offset by
higher
selling, general and
administrative expenses primarily due to the acquisition of Inari
and continued investments to support our growth.
The
increase
in Orthopaedics operating income as a percentage
of net sales for the
three months
was primarily driven by
higher
unit volumes and
lower
manufacturing and supply chain costs
partially offset by
higher
selling, general and administrative
expenses.
Oth
er Income (Expense), Net
Other income (expense), net was
($73)
and
($49)
in the
three
months
2025
and
2024
. The
increase
in net expense in the
three
months
2025
from
2024
was primarily due to higher interest
expense in
2025
partially offset by higher interest income.
Income Taxes
Our effective tax rates were
14.4%
and
14.6%
in the
three
months
2025
and
2024
. The effective tax rates for the
three
months
2025
and
2024
reflect the continued lower effective
income tax rates as a result of our European operations and
certain discrete tax items.
The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development
(OECD), which represents a coalition of member countries, has
put forth two proposed base erosion and profit shifting
frameworks that revise the existing profit allocation and nexus
rules (Pillar One) and ensure a minimal level of taxation (Pillar
Two). On December 12, 2022 the European Union member
states agreed to implement the Inclusive Framework’s global
corporate minimum tax rate of 15%, and various countries within
and outside the European Union have either enacted or proposed
new tax laws implementing Pillar Two in 2024. The OECD
continues to release additional guidance and we anticipate more
countries will enact similar tax laws. Some of the new tax laws
became effective in 2024 while others will be effective
in 2025
and future years
. These tax law changes and any additional
contemplated tax law changes could increase tax expense in
future periods
.
Net Earnings
Net earnings
decreased
to
$654
or
$1.69
per diluted share in the
three months
2025
from
$788
or
$2.05
per diluted share in
2024
.
Refer to the discussion above for the primary drivers of the
change.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
We supplement the reporting of our financial information
determined under accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States (GAAP) with certain non-GAAP financial measures,
including percentage sales growth in constant currency;
percentage organic sales growth; adjusted gross profit; adjusted
selling, general and administrative expenses; adjusted research,
development and engineering expenses; adjusted operating
income; adjusted other income (expense), net; adjusted income
taxes; adjusted effective income tax rate; adjusted net earnings;
and adjusted net earnings per diluted share (Diluted EPS). We
believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful
information to assist investors and shareholders in understanding
our financial results and assessing our prospects for future
performance. Management believes percentage sales growth in
constant currency and the other adjusted measures described
above are important indicators of our operations because they
exclude items that may not be indicative of or are unrelated to our
core operating results and provide a baseline for analyzing trends
in our underlying businesses. Management uses these non-
GAAP financial measures for reviewing the operating results of
reportable business segments and analyzing potential future
business trends in connection with our budget process and bases
certain management incentive compensation on these non-GAAP
financial measures. To measure percentage sales growth in
constant currency, we remove the impact of changes in foreign
currency exchange rates that affect the comparability and trend
of sales. Percentage sales growth in constant currency is
calculated by translating current and prior year results at the
same foreign currency exchange rate. To measure percentage
organic sales growth, we remove the impact of changes in
foreign currency exchange rates, acquisitions and divestitures,
which affect the comparability and trend of sales. Percentage
organic sales growth is calculated by translating current year and
prior year results at the same foreign currency exchange rates
excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures. To measure
earnings performance on a consistent and comparable basis, we
exclude certain items that affect the comparability of operating
results and the trend of earnings. The income tax effect of each
adjustment was determined based on the tax effect of the
jurisdiction in which the related pre-tax adjustment was recorded.
These adjustments are irregular in timing and may not be
indicative of our past and future performance. The following are
examples of the types of adjustments that may be included in a
period:
1.
Acquisition and integration-related costs
. Costs related to
integrating recently acquired businesses (e.g., costs
associated with the termination of sales relationships,
employee retention and workforce reductions, manufacturing
integration costs and other integration-related activities),
changes in the fair value of contingent consideration,
amortization of inventory stepped-up to fair value, specific
costs (e.g., deal costs and costs associated with legal entity
rationalization) related to the consummation of the
acquisition process and legal entity rationalization and
acquisition-related tax items.
2.
Amortization of purchased intangible assets
. Periodic
amortization expense related to purchased intangible assets.
3.
Structural optimization and other special charges.
Costs
associated with employee retention and workforce
reductions, the closure or transfer of manufacturing and
other facilities (e.g., site closure costs, contract termination
costs and redundant employee costs during the work
transfers), product line exits (primarily inventory, long-lived
asset and specifically-identified intangible asset write-offs),
certain long-lived and intangible asset write-offs and
impairments and other charges.
4.
Medical device regulations.
Costs specific to updating our
quality system, product labeling, asset write-offs and product
remanufacturing to comply with the new medical device
reporting regulations and other requirements of the
European Union.
5.
Recall-related matters
. Changes in our best estimate of the
probable loss, or the minimum of the range of probable
losses when a best estimate within a range is not known, to
resolve the Rejuvenate, LFIT V40, Wright legacy hip
products and other product recalls.
6.
Regulatory and legal matters
. Changes in our best estimate
of the probable loss, or the minimum of the range of
probable losses when a best estimate within a range is not
known, to resolve certain regulatory or other legal matters
and the amount of favorable awards from settlements.
7.
Tax matters
. Impact of accounting for certain significant and
discrete tax items.
Because non-GAAP financial measures are not standardized, it
may not be possible to compare these financial measures with
other companies' non-GAAP financial measures having the same
or similar names. These adjusted financial measures should not
be considered in isolation or as a substitute for reported sales
growth, gross profit, selling, general and administrative expenses,
research, development and engineering expenses, operating
income, other income (expense), net, income taxes, effective
income tax rate, net earnings and net earnings per diluted share,
the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. These
non-GAAP financial measures are an additional way of viewing
aspects of our operations when viewed with our GAAP results
and the reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial
measures at the end of the discussion of Consolidated Results of
Operations below. We strongly encourage investors and
shareholders to review our financial statements and publicly-filed
reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial
measure.
The weighted-average diluted shares outstanding used in the
calculation of adjusted net earnings per diluted share are the
same as those used in the calculation of reported net earnings
per diluted share for the respective period.
(a) Charges represent certain acquisition and integration-related costs associated with acquisitions, including:
(b) Structural optimization and other special charges represent the costs associated with:
(c) Goodwill and other impairments represent the costs associated with:
(d) Charges represent the costs specific to updating our quality system, product labeling, asset write-offs and product remanufacturing to comply with the medical device
reporting regulations and other requirements of the new medical device regulations in the European Union.
(e)  Charges represent changes in our best estimate of the probable loss, or the minimum of the range of probable losses when a best estimate within a range is not known, to
resolve certain recall-related matters.
(f)  Charges represent changes in our best estimate of the probable loss, or the minimum of the range of probable losses when a best estimate within a range is not known, to
resolve certain regulatory or other legal matters and the amount of favorable awards from settlements.
(g)    Benefits / (charges) represent the accounting impact of certain significant and discrete tax items, including:
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY
Operating Activities
Cash
provided
by
operating activities was
$250
and
$204
in the
three months
2025
and
2024
. The
increase
was primarily due to
higher net earnings partially offset by the timing of payments and
collections in working capital accounts.
Investing Activities
Cash
used
in
investing activities was
$4,136
and
$408
in the
three months
2025
and
2024
. The
three months
2025
included
cash paid to acquire Inari and purchases of property, plant and
equipment partially offset by proceeds from the sale of short-term
investments. The
three months
2024
included cash paid for the
Serf acquisition. Refer to Note 7 to our Consolidated Financial
Statements for further information on acquisitions.
Financing Activities
Cash
provided
by
financing activities was
$2,534
in the
three
months
2025
and cash
used
in
financing activities was
$418
in
the
three months
2024
. In
2025
, cash
provided
was primarily
driven by proceeds from the issuance of various senior
unsecured notes as described in Note 8 to our Consolidated
Financial Statements. This was partially offset by dividend
payments and cash paid for taxes on withheld shares. Cash
used
in
2024
was primarily driven by dividend payments
and cash paid
for taxes on withheld shares. We did not repurchase any shares
in the
three months
2025
and
2024
.
Liquidity
Cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and
marketable
securities
were
$2,409
and
$4,493
on

. Current assets
exceeded
current liabilities
by
$5,093
and
$7,231
on
March 31, 2025
and
December 31,
2024
. We anticipate being able to support our short-term liquidity
and operating needs from a variety of sources including cash
from operations, commercial paper and existing credit lines.
We have raised funds in the capital markets and have accessed
the credit markets in the past and may continue to do so from
time-to-time. We continue to have strong investment-grade short-
term and long-term debt ratings that we believe should enable us
to refinance our debt as needed.
Our cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and
marketable securities held in locations outside the United States
was
29%
on
March 31, 2025
compared to
20%
on
December 31,

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
There was no change to our internal control over financial
reporting during the
three months 2025
that materially affected,
or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over
financial reporting.
PART II – OTHER INFORMATION
We are not aware of any material changes to the risk factors
included in Item 1A. "Risk Factors" in our Annual Report on Form
10-K for
2024
.
We issued 9,324 shares of our common stock In the three
months
2025
as performance incentive awards to employees.
These shares are not registered under the Securities Act of 1933
based on the conclusion that the awards would not be events of
sale within the meaning of Section 2(a)(3) of the Act.
In March 2015 we announced that our Board of Directors had
authorized us to purchase up to $2,000 of our common stock.
The manner, timing and amount of repurchases are determined
by management based on an evaluation of market conditions,
stock price, and other factors and are subject to regulatory
considerations. Purchases are made from time-to-time in the
open market, in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise.
In the
three months 2025
we did not repurchase
any shares of
our common stock under our authorized repurchase program.
The total dollar value of shares of our common stock that could
be acquired under our authorized repurchase program was
$1,033
as of
March 31, 2025
.
Certain of our officers or directors have made elections to
participate in, and are participating in, our employee stock
purchase plan and 401(k) plan and have made, and may from
time to time make, elections to have shares withheld to cover
withholding taxes due or pay the exercise price of stock options,
restricted stock units and performance stock units, which may
constitute non-Rule 10b5–1 trading arrangements (as defined in
Item 408(c) of Regulation S-K).
