Please see “Risk Factors” in Citi’s 2024 Form 10-K for a discussion of material risks and uncertainties that could impact Citigroup’s businesses, results of operations and financial condition.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Citi prepares its financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and also presents certain non-GAAP financial measures (non-GAAP measures) that exclude certain items or otherwise include components that differ from the most directly comparable measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be a substitute for GAAP financial measures and may not be defined or calculated the same way as non-GAAP measures with similar names used by other companies.
Citi’s non-GAAP measures in this Form 10-Q include:
•
Expenses excluding the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) special assessment and/or divestiture-related impacts
•
All Other
(managed basis), which excludes divestiture-related impacts
•
Revenues excluding divestiture-related impacts
•
Banking
and Corporate Lending revenues excluding gain (loss) on loan hedges
•
Tangible common equity (TCE), return on tangible common equity (RoTCE) and tangible book value per share (TBVPS)
•
Non-
Markets
net interest income
For more information on the FDIC special assessment, see “Executive Summary” and Note 17 below. Citi believes its results excluding the FDIC special assessment are useful to investors, industry analysts and others in evaluating Citi’s results of operations and comparing its operational performance between periods, by providing a meaningful depiction of the underlying fundamentals of period-to-period operating results, particularly given the outsized impact of this item, as well as additional comparability to peer companies.
Citi’s revenues and expenses excluding divestiture-related impacts represent as reported, or GAAP, financial results adjusted for items that are incurred and recognized, which are wholly and necessarily a consequence of actions taken to sell (including through a public offering), dispose of or wind down business activities associated with Citi’s previously announced exit markets within
All Other
—Legacy Franchises. Citi’s Chief Executive Officer, its chief operating decision maker, regularly reviews financial information for
All Other
on a managed basis that excludes these divestiture-related impacts. For more information on Citi’s results excluding divestiture- related impacts, see “Executive Summary” and “
All Other
—Divestiture-Related Impacts (Reconciling Items)” below.
Citi believes its revenues and expenses excluding divestiture-related impacts are useful to investors, industry analysts and others in evaluating Citi’s results of operations and comparing its operational performance between periods, by providing a meaningful depiction of the underlying fundamentals of period-to-period operating results; improved visibility into management decisions and their impacts on operational performance; and additional comparability to peer companies.

For more information on
Banking
and Corporate Lending revenues excluding gain (loss) on loan hedges, see “Executive Summary” and “
Banking
” below. Citi believes that
Banking
and Corporate Lending revenues excluding gain (loss) on loan hedges are useful to investors, industry analysts and others because the gain (loss) on loan hedges are independent of
Banking
and Corporate Lending’s core operations and not indicative of the performance of the business operations.
For more information on TCE, RoTCE and TBVPS, see “Capital Resources—Tangible Common Equity, Book Value Per Share, Tangible Book Value Per Share and Return on Equity” below. TCE, RoTCE and TBVPS are used by management, as well as investors, industry analysts and others, in assessing Citi’s use of equity. Citi believes TCE and RoTCE are useful to investors, industry analysts and others by providing alternative measures of capital strength and performance. Citi believes TBVPS provides additional useful information about the level of tangible assets in relation to Citi’s outstanding shares of common stock.
For more information on non-
Markets
net interest income, see “Market Risk—Non-
Markets
Net Interest Income” below.
Management uses non-
Markets
net interest income to assess the performance of Citi’s non-
Markets
lending, investing (including asset-liability management) and deposit-raising activities, apart from any volatility associated with such
Markets
’ activities. Citi believes the use of this non-GAAP measure provides investors, industry analysts and others with an alternative measure to analyze the net interest income trends of Citi’s lending, investing and deposit-raising activities, by providing a meaningful depiction of the underlying fundamentals of period-to-period operating results of those activities; improved visibility into management decisions and their impacts on operational performance; and additional comparability to peer companies.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
First Quarter of 2025—Results Demonstrated Improved Business Performance and Continued Progress on Citigroup’s Strategic Priorities
As described further throughout this Executive Summary, during the first quarter of 2025:
•
Citi and its five reportable operating segments each achieved positive operating leverage. This is the fourth consecutive quarter of positive operating leverage for Citi at the company-wide level. Citi’s positive operating leverage was driven by revenue growth of 3% and disciplined expense management (down 5%). Excluding the impact of FDIC special assessments and divestiture-related expenses in both periods, total expenses decreased 3% compared to the prior-year period.
•
Citi continued to advance its transformation, including, among other things, making key investments to consolidate and modernize its infrastructure, retiring legacy applications and automating high-priority manual reconciliations. (See “Citi’s Multiyear Transformation” below.)
•
Citi returned $2.8 billion to common shareholders in the form of dividends ($1.1 billion), as well as share repurchases ($1.75 billion) under its multiyear $20 billion common stock repurchase program.
•
Citi’s Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) Capital ratio under the Basel III Standardized Approach was 13.4% as of March 31, 2025, approximately 130 basis points above its current required regulatory minimum.
•
As part of its strategic refresh, Citi continued to make progress with the wind-downs of its Korea consumer banking operations and its overall operations in Russia, as well as the preparation for a planned initial public offering (IPO) of its consumer banking and small business and middle-market banking operations in Mexico (Mexico Consumer/SBMM (Banamex)).
First Quarter of 2025 Results Summary
Citigroup
Citi reported net income of $4.1 billion, or $1.96 per share, compared to net income of $3.4 billion, or $1.58 per share in the prior-year period.
Net income increased 21% versus the prior-year period, driven by higher revenues and lower expenses, partially offset by higher cost of credit. Citi’s effective tax rate was approximately 25% in both the current and prior-year periods. Average diluted shares outstanding decreased 1%.
Citi’s revenues of $21.6 billion in the first quarter of 2025 increased 3% versus the prior-year period, on a reported basis. The increase included no divestiture-related impacts in the current quarter and $(12) million in the prior-year period. Excluding the divestiture-related impact in the prior-year period, revenues also increased 3%, driven by growth across each of Citi’s five businesses, largely offset by a decline in
All
Other
(managed basis). (For additional information on the divestiture-related impacts, see “
All Other
—Divestiture-Related Impacts (Reconciling Items)” below.)
Citi’s average loans were $691 billion, up 2% versus the prior-year period, primarily driven by growth in Retail Banking and Branded Cards in
USPB
as well as higher loans in
Markets
and
Services
, partially offset by lower loans in
Banking
and
Wealth
. For additional information about Citi’s loans by business, including drivers and loan trends, see each respective business’s results of operations and “Credit Risk—Loans” below.
Citi’s average deposits were approximately $1.3 trillion, down 2% versus the prior-year period, driven by an increase in
Services
that was more than offset by lower deposits in
All Other
(managed basis),
USPB
,
Markets
and
Wealth
. For additional information about Citi’s deposits by business, including drivers and deposit trends, see each respective business’s results of operations and “Liquidity Risk—Deposits” below.
Expenses
Citi’s operating expenses of $13.4 billion decreased 5% from the prior-year period. The decrease included divestiture-related impacts of $34 million and an FDIC special assessment of $20 million in the current quarter. This compares to divestiture-related impacts of $110 million and an FDIC special assessment of $251 million in the prior-year period. Excluding divestiture-related impacts and the FDIC special assessments in both periods, expenses decreased 3%, largely driven by the absence of a restructuring charge and lower compensation expenses, which benefited from a favorable foreign exchange (FX) translation impact. These drivers were partially offset by increases in technology/communications and professional services expenses related to Citi’s transformation, as well as advertising and marketing expense.
Cost of Credit
Citi’s total provisions for credit losses and for benefits and claims was $2.7 billion, compared to $2.4 billion in the prior-year period. The increase was largely driven by a higher net build in the allowance for credit losses (ACL) related to uncertainty and deterioration in the macroeconomic outlook in the current quarter relative to the prior-year period and higher net credit losses in the card portfolios in
USPB
. For additional information on Citi’s ACL, see “Significant Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates—Citi’s Allowance for Credit Losses (ACL)” below.
Net credit losses of $2.5 billion increased 7% from the prior-year period. Consumer net credit losses of $2.3 billion increased 6%, primarily driven by the card portfolios in
USPB
. Corporate net credit losses were $182 million versus $164 million in the prior-year period.
Subject to continued evolving macroeconomic conditions, Citi expects to continue to experience an elevated net credit loss rate for full-year 2025 in line with 2024, with higher loss rates in the first half of the year in Branded Cards and Retail
7
Services consistent with seasonal patterns. Citi also expects that its future ACL builds during the remainder of 2025 will be a function of both the macroeconomic environment and business volumes, among other factors.
For additional information on Citi’s consumer and corporate credit costs, see each respective business’s results of operations and “Credit Risk” below.
Capital
Citigroup’s CET1 Capital ratio decreased to 13.4% as of March 31, 2025, compared to 13.5% as of March 31, 2024, based on the Basel III Standardized Approach for determining risk-weighted assets (RWA). The decrease was primarily driven by the payment of common and preferred dividends, common share repurchases, an increase in RWA and net adverse movements in
Accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI)
, largely offset by net income.
In the first quarter of 2025, Citi repurchased $1.75 billion of common shares and paid $1.1 billion of common dividends (see “Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities, Repurchases of Equity Securities and Dividends” below). For the second quarter of 2025, Citi is targeting a similar level of common share repurchases as the first quarter of 2025, subject to market conditions and other factors. For additional information on capital-related risks, trends and uncertainties, see “Capital Resources—Regulatory Capital Standards and Developments” below and “Risk Factors—Strategic Risks,” “—Operational Risks” and “—Compliance Risks” in Citi’s 2024 Form 10-K.
Citigroup’s Supplementary Leverage ratio as of March 31, 2025 was 5.8%, largely unchanged from the prior-year period, as an increase in Total Leverage Exposure was offset by higher Tier 1 Capital. For additional information on Citi’s capital ratios and related components, see “Capital Resources” below.
Services
Services
net income of $1.6 billion increased 7% from the prior-year period, driven by higher revenues and lower expenses.
Services
revenues of $4.9 billion increased 3%, driven by growth in Treasury and Trade Solutions (TTS). Net interest income increased 5%, driven by higher deposit spreads, as well as an increase in deposit and loan balances. Non-interest revenue decreased 4%, driven by a decline in Securities Services due to the presence of certain episodic fees in the prior-year period, as well as higher revenue share and the impact of FX translation in both TTS and Securities Services, partially offset by continued strength in underlying fee drivers across both businesses.
TTS revenues of $3.6 billion increased 4%, driven by a 5% increase in net interest income, partially offset by a 2% decrease in non-interest revenue. The increase in net interest income was driven by higher deposit spreads, as well as increases in both deposit and loan balances. The decrease in non-interest revenue was driven by the impact of higher revenue share and FX translation, primarily offset by an increase in cross-border transaction value of 5%, an increase in U.S. dollar clearing volume of 8% and an increase in commercial card spend volume of 2%.
Securities Services revenues of $1.2 billion were largely unchanged versus the prior-year period. Net interest income increased 7% on higher deposit balances, which was offset by a 6% decrease in non-interest revenue. The decrease in non-interest revenue was driven by the presence of certain episodic fees in the prior-year period, the impact of FX translation and higher revenue share, partially offset by increases in assets under custody and administration.
Services
expenses of $2.6 billion decreased 3%, largely driven by lower deposit insurance costs, severance and legal expenses. Cost of credit was $51 million, compared to $64 million in the prior-year period.

Markets
net income of $1.8 billion increased 27% from the prior-year period, driven by higher revenues, partially offset by higher expenses.
Markets
revenues of $6.0 billion increased 12%, driven by an 8% increase in Fixed Income Markets and a 23% increase in Equity Markets. The increase in Fixed Income Markets was driven by growth across rates and currencies, as well as spread products and other fixed income. Rates and currencies increased 9%, largely driven by increased client and trading activity. Spread products and other fixed income increased 7%, driven by higher client activity and loan growth, mainly in spread products. The increase in Equity Markets was primarily driven by equity derivatives, on increased market volatility and higher client activity, and momentum in prime services, with prime balances up approximately 16%.
Markets
expenses of $3.5 billion increased 2%, driven by higher volume and other revenue-related expenses. Cost of credit was $201 million versus $199 million in the prior-year period.

revenues of $2.0 billion increased 12%, driven by growth in Investment Banking as well as the impact of mark-to-market on loan hedges, partially offset by a decline in Corporate Lending. Excluding the gain (loss) on loan hedges,
Banking
revenues of $1.9 billion increased 5%. Investment Banking revenues increased 12%, driven by an increase in investment banking fees of 14%, due to growth in Advisory, partially offset by declines in Equity Capital Markets (ECM) and Debt Capital Markets (DCM). Advisory fees increased 84%, as the business gained wallet share overall and across several sectors. ECM fees were down 26% amid a decline in the market wallet for follow-ons and convertibles. DCM fees were down 3% compared to a strong prior-year performance. Corporate Lending revenues increased 13%, including the gain (loss) on loan hedges. Excluding the gain (loss) on loan hedges, Corporate Lending revenues decreased 1%, driven by the impact of lower loan balances and higher recoveries in the prior-year period, primarily offset by higher revenue share.

All Other
(managed basis) revenues of $1.4 billion decreased 39%, driven by lower net interest income and the impact of mark-to-market valuation changes on certain investments in Corporate/Other, as well as lower revenue related to closed exits and wind-downs and the impact of Mexican peso depreciation. Corporate/Other revenues of $(176) million decreased from $557 million in the prior-year period, largely driven by lower net interest income and the impact of valuation adjustments on certain investments and positions. Legacy Franchises (managed basis) revenues of $1.6 billion decreased 11%, driven by lower revenue related to closed exits and wind-downs and the impact of Mexican peso depreciation.
All Other
(managed basis) expenses of $2.2 billion decreased 17%, primarily driven by a smaller FDIC special assessment and the absence of a restructuring charge versus the prior-year period, as well as the reduction from closed exits and wind-downs and the impact of Mexican peso depreciation.

Macroeconomic and Other Risks and Uncertainties
Various macroeconomic, geopolitical and regulatory factors have contributed to economic uncertainty in the U.S. and globally, including, but not limited to, those related to policies and actions of the U.S. administration. In April 2025, the U.S. administration announced a 10% baseline tariff on imports from nearly all U.S. trading partners, as well as additional individualized “reciprocal” tariffs, which after retaliatory measures have resulted in tariffs as high as 145% on Chinese imports. The U.S. administration subsequently delayed most tariffs above the 10% baseline (excluding China) for 90 days to allow for negotiations. The U.S. administration has also implemented separate tariffs on Mexico and Canada, as well as on automobile, steel and aluminum imports, among others. Certain U.S. trading partners have announced retaliatory tariffs in response. Uncertainty regarding the final imposition of tariffs and impacts on global trade flows has resulted in heightened market volatility and raised concerns about the near-term impact on inflation, unemployment and economic
9
growth, including increasing concerns over the potential for a recession.
The above risks could adversely affect Citi’s clients, customers, businesses, funding costs, cost of credit and overall results of operations and financial condition during the remainder of 2025 and future years. For a discussion of other trends, uncertainties and risks that will or could impact Citi’s businesses, results of operations, capital and other financial condition during the remainder of 2025, see “First Quarter of 2025 Results Summary” above, “Citi’s Multiyear Transformation,” each respective business’s results of operations, “Managing Global Risk,” including “Managing Global Risk—Other Risks—Country Risk—Russia” and “—Argentina,” and “Forward-Looking Statements” below and “Risk Factors” in Citi’s 2024 Form 10-K.

CITI’S MULTIYEAR TRANSFORMATION
Overview
As previously disclosed, Citi’s transformation, including the remediation of its 2020 Consent Orders with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (FRB) and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), is a multiyear endeavor that is not linear. Citi is modernizing and simplifying the Company in order to lead in a dynamic, competitive and digital world. Through its transformation, Citi is addressing decades of underinvestment in its infrastructure, going beyond remedying regulatory concerns to intentionally transform how the organization operates, and making investments that not only support current needs, but also benefit the Company over the long term. For additional information on Citi’s transformation, including focus areas and status, consent order compliance, governance and the Transformation Bonus Program, see “Citi’s Multiyear Transformation” in Citi’s 2024 Form 10-K and Citi’s 2025 Proxy Statement for its Annual Meeting of Stockholders.
Transformation efforts of this scale involve significant complexities and uncertainties, including ongoing regulatory challenges and risks. Citi’s transformation initiatives will take several years to complete, and, as previously disclosed, Citi may continue to experience significant challenges in progressing the transformation and satisfying the regulators’ expectations in both sufficiency and timing, particularly with regard to data quality management related to governance and regulatory reporting. The regulators may also identify additional risk and control issues that could result in further regulatory actions. For additional information about regulatory risks related to Citi’s transformation initiatives, see “Forward-Looking Statements” below and “Risk Factors—Compliance Risks” in Citi’s 2024 Form 10-K.
Citi’s transformation target outcomes remain focused on changing its business and operating models such that they simultaneously (i) strengthen controls, enhance data quality, reduce risk and improve Citi’s regulatory compliance and its culture, and (ii) enhance Citi’s value to customers, clients and shareholders.
Transformation Focus Areas and Status
Over the last several years, Citi has made key investments to, among other things, consolidate and modernize its
infrastructure, simplify and automate manual processes, and enhance technology, data and analytics. In particular, Citi’s transformation-related expenses include costs related to risk and controls, data and finance programs and other 2020 Consent Order programs, as well as spending on certain other regulatory initiatives unrelated to the 2020 Consent Orders, and spending on enterprise-wide technology infrastructure and the Transformation Bonus Program.
Progress
Examples of Citi’s transformation progress in or through the first quarter of 2025 include:
•
Continuing to optimize, modernize and simplify Citi by retiring or replacing 130 applications in the current quarter
•
Significantly expanding adoption of Generative AI tools, increasing efficiency and productivity across Citi
◦
Logged 385,000 utilizations of two enterprise-wide tools (document intelligence and virtual assistant)
◦
Completed approximately 220,000 automated code reviews in the Generative AI developer tool, considerably increasing coding capacity
◦
Launched Agent Assist, Citi’s first
USPB
Generative AI customer service tool
•
Automating high-priority manual reconciliations, supporting

1Q25 vs. 1Q24
Net income
of $1.6 billion increased 7%, driven by higher revenues and lower expenses.
Revenues
increased 3%, driven by higher net interest income in TTS and Securities Services, partially offset by lower non-interest revenue across both businesses.
Net interest income increased 5%, driven by higher deposit spreads, as well as an increase in deposit and loan balances (average loans were up 6%, primarily driven by strong demand in TTS for export and agency finance, as well as working capital loans), partially offset by lower loan spreads. Average deposits increased 2%, driven by growth in Securities Services and modest growth in TTS as the businesses continued to increase operating deposits, and growth in Custody and Issuer Services.
Non-interest revenue declined 4%, driven by Securities Services due to the presence of certain episodic fees in the prior-year period, as well as higher revenue share with
Banking
—Corporate Lending and the impact of FX translation in both TTS and Securities Services, partially offset by the
benefit of continued strength in underlying fee drivers in TTS and Securities Services.
TTS revenues increased 4%, reflecting 5% growth in net interest income, partially offset by a 2% decrease in non-interest revenue. The increase in net interest income was driven by higher deposit spreads, as well as an increase in deposit and loan balances. Average deposits increased 1%, driven by North America, partially offset by a decline in International. The decrease in non-interest revenue was driven by higher revenue share with
Banking—
Corporate Lending and the impact of FX translation, primarily offset by growth in underlying fee drivers, including cross-border transaction value (up 5%), U.S. dollar clearing volume (up 8%) and commercial card spend volume (up 2%).
Securities Services revenues were largely unchanged, as a 6% decrease in non-interest revenue was offset by a 7% increase in net interest income, driven by higher deposit balances. Average deposits increased 10%, reflecting growth in both North America and International. The decrease in non-interest revenue was driven by the presence of certain episodic
17
fees in the prior-year period, along with the impact of FX translation and higher revenue share with
Banking
—Corporate Lending. The impact of these drivers was partially offset by 9% growth in AUC/AUA, which benefited from higher market valuations, new client onboarding and deepening of relationships with existing clients.
Expenses
decreased 3%, largely driven by lower deposit insurance costs, severance and legal expenses.
Provisions
were $51 million, compared to $64 million in the prior-year period, driven by a lower net ACL build on loans and unfunded lending commitments of $18 million, compared to $46 million in the prior-year period.
The current-quarter net ACL build of $45 million was driven by uncertainty and deterioration in the macroeconomic outlook and an increase in transfer risk associated with unremittable corporate dividends outside the U.S. being held on behalf of clients, driven by safety and soundness considerations under U.S. banking law.

MARKETS
Markets
provides corporate, institutional and public sector clients around the world with a full range of sales and trading services across equities, foreign exchange, rates, spread products and commodities. The range of services includes market-making across asset classes, risk management solutions, financing and prime brokerage.
As a market maker,
Markets
facilitates transactions, including holding product inventory to meet client demand, and earns the differential between the price at which it buys and sells the products. These price differentials and the unrealized gains and losses on the inventory are recorded in
Principal transactions
.
Fee revenue
is earned through providing clients with a range of services including but not limited to trading, financing, brokerage, securitization and underwriting.
Other
primarily includes realized gains and losses on available-for-sale (AFS) debt securities, gains and losses on equity securities not held in trading accounts and other non-recurring gains and losses. Interest income earned on assets held, less interest paid on long- and short-term debt, secured funding transactions and customer deposits, is recorded as
Net interest income.
The amount and types of
Markets
revenues are impacted by a variety of interrelated factors, including market liquidity; changes in market variables such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices, commodity prices and credit spreads, as well as their implied volatilities; investor confidence; and other macroeconomic conditions.
Markets
revenues include revenues earned by Citi that are subject to a revenue sharing arrangement with
Banking
—Corporate Lending for Investment Banking,
Markets
and
Services
products sold to
Banking
—Corporate Lending clients.
Assuming all other market conditions do not change, increases in client activity levels or bid/offer spreads generally result in increases in revenues. However, changes in market conditions can significantly impact client activity levels, bid/offer spreads and the fair value of product inventory. Management of the
Markets
businesses involves daily monitoring and evaluation of the above factors.
Markets

1Q25 vs. 1Q24
Net income
of $1.8 billion increased 27%, driven by higher revenues, partially offset by higher expenses.
Revenues
increased 12%, driven by higher revenues in both Fixed Income and Equity Markets.
Fixed Income Markets revenues
increased 8%, reflecting an increase in rates and currencies revenues and higher revenues in spread products and other fixed income. Rates and currencies revenues increased 9%, reflecting increased client and trading activity. Spread products and other fixed income revenues increased 7%, driven by higher fees from client activity as well as loan growth, mainly in spread products. The increase was partially offset by a decline in commodities revenues.
Equity Markets revenues increased
23%, primarily driven by equity derivatives on increased market volatility and higher client activity, and momentum in prime services. Equity cash trading revenues were also up modestly. Equity markets continued to experience momentum in prime balances, which were up approximately 16%.
Expenses
increased 2%, driven by higher volume and other revenue-related expenses.
Provisions
were $201 million, compared to $199 million in the prior-year period
. The current-quarter provisions were primarily related to spread products and driven by net credit losses and a net ACL build due to uncertainty and deterioration in the macroeconomic outlook.

BANKING
Banking
includes Investment Banking and Corporate Lending. Investment Banking supports clients’ capital-raising needs to help strengthen and grow their businesses, including equity and debt capital markets-related strategic financing solutions and loan syndication structuring, as well as advisory services related to mergers and acquisitions, divestitures, restructurings and corporate defense activities. Corporate Lending consists of
corporate and commercial banking, serving as the conduit for Citi’s full product suite to clients.
Banking
revenues include revenues earned by Citi that are subject to a revenue sharing arrangement for Investment Banking,
Markets
and
Services
products sold to Corporate Lending clients.

Gain (loss) on loan hedges includes the mark-to-market on the credit derivatives, partially offset by the mark-to-market on the loans in the portfolio that are at fair value. Hedges on accrual loans reflect the mark-to-market on credit derivatives used to economically hedge the corporate loan accrual portfolio. The fixed premium costs of these hedges are netted against the corporate lending revenues to reflect the cost of credit protection. Citigroup’s results of operations excluding the impact of gain (loss) on loan hedges are non-GAAP financial measures.

1Q25 vs. 1Q24
Net income
was $543 million, compared to $524 million in the prior-year period, driven by higher revenues and lower expenses, offset by an increase in cost of credit.
Revenues
increased 12% (including gain (loss) on loan hedges), reflecting higher Investment Banking revenues and the impact of a gain on loan hedges ($14 million versus a loss of $104 million in the prior-year period), partially offset by a decline in Corporate Lending revenues. Excluding the impact of gain (loss) on loan hedges,
Banking
revenues increased 5%.
Investment Banking revenues increased 12%, reflecting a 14% increase in investment banking fees, driven by growth in Advisory, partially offset by declines in ECM and DCM. Advisory fees increased 84%, due to strong previously announced deal volume coming to fruition as those transactions closed, with share gains across several sectors. ECM fees were down 26% amid a decline in the market wallet for follow-ons and convertibles, partially offset by an increase in IPO activity. DCM fees were down 3% compared to a strong prior-year period.
Corporate Lending revenues increased 13%, including the impact of gain (loss) on loan hedges. Excluding the impact of gain (loss) on loan hedges, Corporate Lending revenues decreased 1%, driven by lower average loan balances (down 8%) and higher recoveries in the prior-year period, primarily
offset by higher revenue share from
Services
,
Markets
and Investment Banking.
Expenses
decreased 12%, largely driven by lower compensation, reflecting the benefits of prior repositioning actions.
Provisions
were $214 million, compared to a benefit of $129 million in the prior-year period, driven by a net ACL build of $180 million, compared to a net release of $195 million in the prior-year period. The net ACL build in the current quarter was driven by uncertainty and deterioration in the macroeconomic outlook.

Net income
was $284 million, compared to $175 million in the prior-year period, driven by higher revenues, largely offset by higher cost of credit.
Revenues
increased 24%, driven by growth across Citigold, Private Bank and Wealth at Work. Net interest income increased 30%, driven by growth in deposit spreads, partially offset by lower deposit balances. Non-interest revenue increased 16%, primarily driven by higher investment fee revenues on growth in client investment assets.
Client balances increased 7%, driven by higher client investment assets (up 16%), reflecting strong net new investment assets (NNIA) generation and higher market valuations. NNIA increased $16.5 billion in the quarter and more than $56 billion in the last 12 months, representing 11% organic growth.
Average deposits decreased 2%, driven by a shift in deposits to higher-yielding investments on the
Wealth
platform and other operating outflows, largely offset by client transfers to Citigold from
USPB
($14 billion at the time of transfer over the last 12 months). Average loans decreased 2%, driven by the transfers of certain relationships and associated mortgage loans to

Private Bank revenues increased 16%, primarily driven by higher deposit spreads and higher investment fee revenues, partially offset by lower deposit balances.
Citigold revenues increased 24%, driven by higher deposit spreads, higher investment fee revenues and higher lending revenues, partially offset by lower deposit balances.
Wealth at Work revenues increased 48%, driven by higher deposit spreads, higher lending revenues and higher investment fee revenues.

1Q25 vs. 1Q24
Net income
was $745 million, compared to $347 million in the prior-year period, driven by lower cost of credit and higher revenues.
Revenues
increased 2%, driven by higher net interest income (up 6%), due to loan growth in Branded Cards, as well as higher deposit spreads in Retail Banking, partially offset by lower non-interest revenue (down 168%) in Retail Services, primarily driven by higher partner payment accruals.
Branded Cards revenues increased 9%, due to interest-earning balance growth (up 8%) and card spend volume growth (up 3%), driven by higher FICO band customers. Branded Cards average loans increased 5%, reflecting the higher card spend volume and higher revolving balances.
Retail Services revenues decreased 11%, primarily driven by lower non-interest revenue due to the higher partner payment accruals, partially offset by higher net interest revenue on growth in interest-earning balances. Retail Services average loans decreased 1%, largely reflecting lower card spend volume. Card spend volume decreased 5%, primarily due to continued lower in-store foot traffic.
Retail Banking revenues increased 17%, driven by the impact of higher deposit spreads, largely offset by the deposit impact from client transfers to
Wealth
. Average deposits decreased 11%, largely reflecting the transfers of certain relationships and the associated deposits to
Wealth
($14 billion at the time of transfer over the last 12 months).
Expenses
were unchanged, as continued productivity savings were offset by higher advertising and marketing as well as legal expenses.
Provisions
were $1.8 billion, compared to $2.2 billion in the prior-year period, driven by a net ACL release on loans of $171 million, compared to a net build of $337 million in the prior-year period. The decrease in
Provisions
was partially offset by higher net credit losses in the card portfolios.
Net credit losses of $2.0 billion increased 6%, primarily reflecting the continued maturation of multiple cards loan vintages originated in recent years. The maturation was delayed by unprecedented levels of government stimulus during the pandemic. In addition, the year-over-year increase was driven by macroeconomic pressures related to the elevated inflationary and interest rate environment impacting both cards portfolios. Branded Cards net credit losses for credit cards were up 11% to $1.1 billion, and Retail Services net credit losses for credit cards were unchanged at $0.8 billion.
The net ACL release was $172 million in the current quarter, driven by lower cards balances, primarily offset by an ACL build for changes in portfolio composition, uncertainty and deterioration in the macroeconomic outlook and the impact of macroeconomic pressures related to the elevated inflationary and interest rate environment.

All Other
(managed basis) revenues decreased 39%, driven by lower revenues in Corporate/Other and Legacy Franchises (managed basis).
Legacy Franchises (managed basis) revenues decreased 11%, due to lower revenues in Mexico Consumer/SBMM (Banamex) (managed basis) and Asia Consumer (managed basis).
Mexico Consumer/SBMM (Banamex) (managed basis) revenues decreased 6%, driven by depreciation of the Mexican peso, partially offset by revenues from higher loan volumes in the retail banking and cards businesses, as well as higher fee revenues.
Asia Consumer (managed basis) revenues decreased 46%, driven by the closed exits and wind-downs.
Corporate/Other revenues decreased to $(176) million, compared to $557 million in the prior-year period, driven by lower net interest income and the impact of valuation adjustments on certain investments and positions.
Expenses
decreased 17%, primarily driven by a smaller FDIC special assessment and the absence of a restructuring charge versus the prior-year period (see Notes 17 and 9, respectively), as well as the reduction from the closed exits and wind-downs and the impact of Mexican peso depreciation.
Provisions
were $359 million, compared to $186 million in the prior-year period, driven by a net ACL build related to uncertainty and deterioration in the macroeconomic outlook in the current quarter, and higher net credit losses in the consumer loan portfolio in Mexico.

During the first quarter of 2025, Citi returned a total of $2.8 billion of capital to common shareholders in the form of $1.1 billion in dividends and $1.8 billion in share repurchases (approximately 23 million common shares) under Citi’s multiyear $20 billion common stock repurchase program. For additional information, see “Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities, Repurchases of Equity Securities and Dividends” below.
Citi paid common dividends of $0.56 per share for the first quarter of 2025, and on April 3, 2025, declared common dividends of $0.56 per share for the second quarter of 2025. Citi plans to maintain a quarterly common dividend of $0.56 per share, subject to financial and macroeconomic conditions as well as its Board of Directors’ approval.
Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratio
Citi’s Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) Capital ratio under the Basel III Standardized Approach was 13.4% as of March 31, 2025, compared to 13.6% as of December 31, 2024, relative to a required regulatory CET1 Capital ratio of 12.1% as of such dates under the Standardized Approach. Citi’s CET1 Capital ratio under the Basel III Advanced Approaches was 11.9% as of March 31, 2025, compared to 12.1% as of December 31, 2024, relative to a required regulatory CET1 Capital ratio of 10.5% as of such dates under the Advanced Approaches framework.
Citi’s CET1 Capital ratio decreased under both the Standardized Approach and Advanced Approaches framework from December 31, 2024, driven primarily by the payment of common and preferred dividends, common share repurchases, increases in Standardized Approach RWA and Advanced Approaches RWA and higher deferred tax assets, partially offset by net income.

(2)
Beginning October 1, 2024, Citi’s required risk-based capital ratios under the Standardized Approach included the 4.1% Stress Capital Buffer through September 30, 2025 and 3.5% GSIB surcharge (all of which must be composed of CET1 Capital). For additional information, see “Capital Resources—Regulatory Capital Buffers” in Citi’s 2024 Form 10-K.
The following tables present Citi’s capital components and ratios as of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024:
(1)
Commencing January 1, 2025, the capital effects resulting from adoption of the current expected credit losses (CECL) methodology have been fully reflected in Citi’s regulatory capital. For additional information, see “Capital Resources—Regulatory Capital Treatment—Modified Transition of the Current Expected Credit Losses Methodology” in Citi’s 2024 Form 10-K.
(2)
Citi’s binding CET1 Capital and Tier 1 Capital ratios were derived under the Basel III Standardized Approach, whereas Citi’s binding Total Capital ratio was derived under the Basel III Advanced Approaches framework for all periods presented.
(3)
Leverage ratio denominator. Represents quarterly average total assets less amounts deducted from Tier 1 Capital.
(4)
Supplementary Leverage ratio denominator.
As indicated in the table above, Citigroup’s capital ratios at March 31, 2025 were in excess of the regulatory capital requirements under the U.S. Basel III rules. In addition, Citi was “well capitalized” under current federal bank regulatory agencies definitions as of March 31, 2025.
32
Components of Citigroup Capital
(1)
Issuance costs of $67 million related to outstanding noncumulative perpetual preferred stock at March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024 were excluded from common stockholders’ equity and netted against such preferred stock in accordance with FRB regulatory reporting requirements, which differ from those under U.S. GAAP.
(2)
Commencing January 1, 2025, the capital effects resulting from adoption of the current expected credit losses (CECL) methodology have been fully reflected in Citi’s regulatory capital. For additional information, see “Capital Resources—Regulatory Capital Treatment—Modified Transition of the Current Expected Credit Losses Methodology” in Citi’s 2024 Form 10-K.
(3)
Includes goodwill “embedded” in the valuation of significant common stock investments in unconsolidated financial institutions.
(4)
Of Citi’s $29.6 billion of net DTAs at March 31, 2025, $11.5 billion of net DTAs arising from net operating loss, foreign tax credit and general business credit tax carry-forwards, as well as $4.3 billion of DTAs arising from temporary differences that exceeded the 10% limitation, were excluded from Citi’s CET1 Capital as of March 31, 2025. DTAs arising from net operating loss, foreign tax credit and general business credit tax carry-forwards are required to be entirely deducted from CET1 Capital under the U.S. Basel III rules. DTAs arising from temporary differences are required to be deducted from capital only if they exceed 10%/15% limitations under the U.S. Basel III rules.
(5)
Assets subject to 10%/15% limitations include MSRs, DTAs arising from temporary differences and significant common stock investments in unconsolidated financial institutions. At March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, this deduction related only to DTAs arising from temporary differences that exceeded the 10% limitation.
(6)
Represents Citigroup Capital XIII trust preferred securities, which are permanently grandfathered as Tier 1 Capital under the U.S. Basel III rules.
33
(7)
Under the Standardized Approach, the allowance for credit losses is eligible for inclusion in Tier 2 Capital up to 1.25% of credit risk-weighted assets, with any excess allowance for credit losses being deducted in arriving at credit risk-weighted assets, which differs from the Advanced Approaches framework, in which eligible credit reserves that exceed expected credit losses are eligible for inclusion in Tier 2 Capital to the extent that the excess reserves do not exceed 0.6% of credit risk-weighted assets. The total amount of eligible credit reserves in excess of expected credit losses that were eligible for inclusion in Tier 2 Capital, subject to limitation, under the Advanced Approaches framework were $5.2 billion and $5.1 billion at March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively.
34
Citigroup Capital Rollforward
(1)    Includes the changes in Citigroup (own credit) credit valuation adjustments (CVA) attributable to own creditworthiness, net of tax.
35
Citigroup Risk-Weighted Assets Rollforward (Basel III Standardized Approach)
(1)
General credit risk exposures include cash and balances due from depository institutions, securities, and loans and leases. General credit risk exposures decreased during the three months ended March 31, 2025, primarily due to the recategorization of certain exposures to other assets, partially offset by increased lending activities.
(2)
Securities financing transactions include repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements, securities loaned and borrowed, and eligible margin loans. Securities financing transactions increased during the three months ended March 31, 2025, primarily driven by business activities.
(3)
Other exposures increased during the three months ended March 31, 2025, mainly due to the recategorization of certain exposures previously classified as part of general credit risk exposures to other assets.
(4)
Market risk increased during the three months ended March 31, 2025, primarily driven by specific risk due to broad-based exposure increases.
36
Citigroup Risk-Weighted Assets Rollforward (Basel III Advanced Approaches)
(1)
General credit risk exposures include cash and balances due from depository institutions, securities, and loans and leases. General credit risk exposures increased during the three months ended March 31, 2025, primarily due to increased exposures in lending and investment securities, partially offset by the recategorization of certain exposures to other assets.
(2)
Derivatives increased during the three months ended March 31, 2025, mainly driven by changes in exposures and credit spread widening.
(3)
Securities financing transactions include repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements, securities loaned and borrowed, and eligible margin loans. Securities financing transactions increased during the three months ended March 31, 2025, primarily driven by business activities.
(4)
Securitization exposures increased during the three months ended March 31, 2025, primarily driven by exposure and parameter changes.
(5)
Other exposures increased during the three months ended March 31, 2025, mainly due to the recategorization of certain exposures previously classified as part of general credit risk exposures to other assets.
(6)
Market risk increased during the three months ended March 31, 2025, primarily driven by specific risk due to broad-based exposure increases.
37
Supplementary Leverage Ratio
The following table presents Citi’s Supplementary Leverage ratio and related components as of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024:
(1)
Represents the daily average of on-balance sheet assets for the quarter.
(2)
Commencing January 1, 2025, the capital effects resulting from adoption of the current expected credit losses (CECL) methodology have been fully reflected in Citi’s regulatory capital. For additional information, see “Capital Resources—Regulatory Capital Treatment—Modified Transition of the Current Expected Credit Losses Methodology” in Citi’s 2024 Form 10-K.
(3)
Represents the average of certain off-balance sheet exposures calculated as of the last day of each month in the quarter.
(4)
Under the U.S. Basel III rules, banking organizations are required to include in Total Leverage Exposure the effective notional amount of sold credit derivatives, with netting of exposures permitted if certain conditions are met.
(5)
Repo-style transactions include repurchase and reverse repurchase transactions as well as securities borrowing and securities lending transactions.
As presented in the table above, Citigroup’s Supplementary Leverage ratio was 5.8% at March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024.
38
Capital Resources of Citigroup’s Subsidiary U.S. Depository Institutions
Citigroup’s subsidiary U.S. depository institutions are also subject to regulatory capital standards issued by their respective primary bank regulatory agencies, which are similar to the standards of the FRB.
The following tables present the capital components and ratios for Citibank, Citi’s primary subsidiary U.S. depository institution, as of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024:
(1)
Citibank’s required risk-based capital ratios are inclusive of the 2.5% Capital Conservation Buffer (all of which must be composed of CET1 Capital).
(2)
Commencing January 1, 2025, the capital effects resulting from adoption of the current expected credit losses (CECL) methodology have been fully reflected in Citibank’s regulatory capital. For additional information, see “Capital Resources—Regulatory Capital Treatment—Modified Transition of the Current Expected Credit Losses Methodology” in Citi’s 2024 Form 10-K.
(3)
Under the Standardized Approach, the allowance for credit losses is eligible for inclusion in Tier 2 Capital up to 1.25% of credit risk-weighted assets, with any excess allowance for credit losses being deducted in arriving at credit risk-weighted assets, which differs from the Advanced Approaches framework, in which eligible credit reserves that exceed expected credit losses are eligible for inclusion in Tier 2 Capital to the extent that the excess reserves do not exceed 0.6% of credit risk-weighted assets.
(4)
Citibank’s binding CET1 Capital, Tier 1 Capital and Total Capital ratios were derived under the Basel III Advanced Approaches framework for all periods presented.
(5)
Citibank must maintain required CET1 Capital, Tier 1 Capital, Total Capital and Leverage ratios of 6.5%, 8.0%, 10.0% and 5.0%, respectively, to be considered “well capitalized” under the revised Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) regulations applicable to insured depository institutions as established by the U.S. Basel III rules. Citibank must also maintain a required Supplementary Leverage ratio of 6.0% to be considered “well capitalized.”
(6)
Leverage ratio denominator. Represents quarterly average total assets less amounts deducted from Tier 1 Capital.
(7)
Supplementary Leverage ratio denominator.
As presented in the table above, Citibank’s capital ratios at March 31, 2025 were in excess of the regulatory capital requirements under the U.S. Basel III rules. In addition, Citibank was “well capitalized” as of March 31, 2025.
Citibank’s Supplementary Leverage ratio was 7.3% at March 31, 2025, compared to 7.1% at December 31, 2024. The increase was primarily driven by net income and a decrease in Total Leverage Exposure, partially offset by the payment of common and preferred dividends.
39
Impact of Changes on Citigroup and Citibank Capital Ratios
The following tables present the hypothetical sensitivity of Citigroup’s and Citibank’s capital ratios to changes of $100 million in CET1 Capital, Tier 1 Capital and Total Capital (numerator), and changes of $1 billion in Advanced Approaches and Standardized Approach RWA and quarterly adjusted average total assets, as well as Total Leverage Exposure (denominator), as of March 31, 2025. This
information is provided for the purpose of analyzing the impact that a change in Citigroup’s or Citibank’s financial position or results of operations could have on these ratios. These sensitivities only consider a single change to either a component of capital, RWA, quarterly adjusted average total assets or Total Leverage Exposure. Accordingly, an event that affects more than one factor may have a larger basis point impact than is reflected in these tables.
Citigroup Broker-Dealer Subsidiaries
At March 31, 2025, Citigroup Global Markets Inc., a U.S. broker-dealer registered with the SEC that is an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Citigroup, had net capital, computed in accordance with the SEC’s net capital rule, of $19 billion, which exceeded the minimum requirement by $14 billion.
Moreover, Citigroup Global Markets Limited, a broker-dealer registered with the United Kingdom’s Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) that is also an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Citigroup, had total regulatory capital of $27 billion at March 31, 2025, which exceeded the PRA’s minimum regulatory capital requirements.
In addition, certain of Citi’s other broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to regulation in the countries in which they do business, including requirements to maintain specified levels of net capital or its equivalent. Citigroup’s other principal broker-dealer subsidiaries were in compliance with their regulatory capital requirements at March 31, 2025.
40
Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity (TLAC)
The table below details Citi’s eligible external TLAC and long-term debt (LTD) amounts and ratios, and each TLAC and LTD regulatory requirement, as well as the surplus amount in dollars in excess of each requirement:
(1)    External TLAC includes method 1 GSIB surcharge of 2.0%.
(2)    LTD includes method 2 GSIB surcharge of 3.5%.
As of March 31, 2025, Citi exceeded each of the TLAC and LTD regulatory requirements, resulting in a $13 billion surplus above its binding TLAC requirement of LTD as a percentage of Total Leverage Exposure.
For additional information on Citi’s TLAC-related requirements, see “Capital Resources—Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity (TLAC)” in Citi’s 2024 Form 10-K.
Regulatory Capital Standards and Developments
Stress Capital Buffer (SCB) Requirements
On April 17, 2025, the FRB issued a notice of proposed rulemaking intended to reduce the volatility of the SCB requirement by averaging the results of the annual supervisory stress test over two years. The proposal would also change the annual effective date of the SCB requirement from October 1 to January 1 in each year. If adopted as proposed, the changes to the calculation of the SCB requirement would be effective beginning with the 2025 supervisory stress test, such that the maximum CET1 Capital declines projected in the 2024 and 2025 supervisory stress tests for Citi would be averaged in producing Citi’s new SCB requirement, which would be effective January 1, 2026.
For information on proposed changes to U.S. regulatory capital requirements, known as the Basel III Endgame, as well as to the GSIB surcharge and the TLAC rule, see “Capital Resources—Regulatory Capital Standards and Developments” in Citi’s 2024 Form 10-K.
41
Tangible Common Equity, Book Value Per Share, Tangible Book Value Per Share and Return on Equity
As defined by Citi, tangible common equity (TCE) represents common stockholders’ equity less goodwill and identifiable intangible assets (other than mortgage servicing rights (MSRs)). Return on tangible common equity (RoTCE) represents annualized net income available to common shareholders as a percentage of average TCE. Tangible book value per share (TBVPS) represents average TCE divided by average common shares outstanding. Other companies may calculate these measures differently.

MANAGING GLOBAL RISK
For Citi, effective risk management is of primary importance to its overall operations. Accordingly, Citi’s risk management process has been designed to monitor, evaluate and manage the principal risks it assumes in conducting its activities. Specifically, the activities that Citi engages in, and the risks those activities generate, must be consistent with Citi’s Mission and Value Proposition and the key Leadership Principles that support it, as well as Citi’s risk appetite. For more information on managing global risk at Citi, see “Managing Global Risk” in Citi’s 2024 Form 10-K.
CREDIT RISK

Loans
The table below details the average loans, by segment and/or business, and the total Citigroup end-of-period loans for each of the periods indicated:
Average loans increased 2% year-over-year and were relatively unchanged sequentially. The year-over-year increase was primarily driven by growth in
USPB
,
Markets
and
Services
, partially offset by declines in
Banking
and
Wealth
.
As of the first quarter of 2025, average loans for:
•
Services
increased 6% year-over-year, primarily driven by strong demand in TTS for export and agency finance, as well as working capital loans.
•
Markets
increased 7% year-over-year, largely driven by asset-backed financing and commercial warehouse lending in spread products.
•
Banking
decreased 8% year-over-year, primarily driven by lower corporate demand.
•
Wealth
decreased 2%, driven by the transfers of certain relationships and associated mortgage loans to
USPB
from
Wealth
, largely offset by growth in secured lending volumes.
•
USPB
increased 6% year-over-year, driven by growth in Retail Banking, largely due to transfers of certain relationships and associated mortgage loans to
USPB
from
Wealth
, as well as Branded Cards due to higher card spend volume and higher revolving balances.
End-of-period loans increased 4% year-over-year and 1% sequentially. The year-over-year increase was driven by growth in
Services
and
Markets
as well as growth in Retail Banking and Branded Cards in
USPB
, partially offset by declines in
Banking
and
Wealth
.
44
CORPORATE CREDIT
The following table details Citi’s corporate credit portfolio across
Services
,
Markets
,
Banking
and the Mexico SBMM component of
All Other
—Legacy Franchises
(excluding loans carried at fair value and loans held-for-sale), and before consideration of collateral or hedges, by remaining tenor or expiration for the periods indicated:
(1)    Includes drawn loans, overdrafts, bankers’ acceptances and leases.
(2)    Includes unused commitments to lend, letters of credit and financial guarantees.
Portfolio Mix—Geography and Counterparty
Citi’s corporate credit portfolio is diverse across geography and counterparty. The following table presents the percentages of this portfolio across North America and the clusters within International based on the country of risk of the obligor (for additional information on Citi’s international exposures, see “Other Risks—Country Risk—Top 25 Country Exposures” below):
The maintenance of accurate and consistent risk ratings across the corporate credit portfolio facilitates the comparison of credit exposure across all lines of business, geographies and products. Counterparty risk ratings reflect an estimated probability of default for a counterparty, and internal risk ratings are derived by leveraging validated statistical models and scorecards in combination with consideration of factors specific to the obligor or market, such as management experience, competitive position, regulatory environment and commodity prices. Facility risk ratings are assigned that reflect the probability of default of the obligor and factors that affect
the loss given default of the facility, such as support or collateral. Internal ratings that generally correspond to BBB and above are considered investment grade, while those below are considered non-investment grade.
The following table presents the corporate credit portfolio by facility risk rating as a percentage of the total corporate credit portfolio:
Note: Total exposure includes direct outstandings and unfunded lending commitments.
In addition to the obligor and facility risk ratings assigned to all exposures, Citi may classify exposures in the corporate credit portfolio. These classifications are consistent with Citi’s interpretation of the U.S. banking regulators’ definition of criticized exposures, which may categorize exposures as special mention, substandard, doubtful or loss.
Risk ratings and classifications are reviewed regularly and adjusted as appropriate. The credit review process incorporates quantitative and qualitative factors, including financial and non-financial disclosures or metrics, idiosyncratic events or changes to the competitive, regulatory or macroeconomic environment.
Citi believes the corporate credit portfolio to be appropriately rated and classified as of March 31, 2025. Citi has applied management judgment to adjust internal ratings and classifications of exposures as both the macroeconomic environment and obligor-specific factors have changed, particularly where additional stress has been observed.
45
As obligor risk ratings are downgraded, the probability of default increases. Downgrades of obligor risk ratings tend to result in a higher provision for credit losses. In addition, appetite per obligor is reduced consistent with the ratings, and downgrades may result in the purchase of additional credit derivatives or other risk/structural mitigants to hedge the incremental credit risk, or may result in Citi seeking to reduce exposure to an obligor or an industry sector. Citi will continue to review exposures to ensure that the appropriate probability of default is incorporated into all risk assessments.
See Note 14 for additional information on Citi’s corporate credit portfolio.
Portfolio Mix—Industry
Citi’s corporate credit portfolio is diversified by industry. The following table details the allocation of Citi’s total corporate credit portfolio by industry:
(1)    As of the periods in the table, Citi had less than 1% exposure to securities firms. See corporate credit portfolio by industry, below.
46
The following table details Citi’s corporate credit portfolio by industry as of March 31, 2025:
(1)    Funded excludes loans carried at fair value of $7.9 billion and HFS of $4.5 billion as of March 31, 2025.
(2)    Unfunded includes lending-related commitments carried at fair value and HFS as of March 31, 2025.
(3)    Includes non-accrual loan exposures and related criticized unfunded exposures.
(4)    Represents the amount of purchased credit protection in the form of derivatives to economically hedge funded and unfunded exposures. Of the $38.8 billion of purchased credit protection, $36.3 billion represents the total notional amount of purchased credit derivatives on individual reference entities. The remaining $2.5 billion represents the first loss tranche of portfolios of purchased credit derivatives with a total notional amount of $19.0 billion, where the protection seller absorbs the first loss on the referenced loan portfolios.
(5)    Autos total credit exposure includes securitization financing facilities secured by auto loans and leases, extended mainly to the finance company subsidiaries of global auto manufacturers, bank subsidiaries and independent auto finance companies, of approximately $17.7 billion ($9.4 billion of which was funded exposure with 100% rated investment grade) as of March 31, 2025.
(6)    In addition to this exposure, Citi has energy-related exposure within the public sector (e.g., energy-related state-owned entities) and the transportation and industrials sector (e.g., off-shore drilling entities) included in the table above. As of March 31, 2025, Citi’s total exposure to these energy-related entities was approximately $4.5 billion, of which approximately $2.0 billion consisted of direct outstanding funded loans.
(7)    Includes $0.7 billion and $0.1 billion of funded and unfunded exposure at March 31, 2025, respectively, primarily related to commercial credit card delinquency-managed loans.
Exposure to Commercial Real Estate
As of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, Citi’s total credit exposure to commercial real estate (CRE) was $67 billion and $65 billion, including $6 billion and $6 billion of exposure related to office buildings, respectively. This total CRE exposure consisted of approximately $58 billion and $56 billion, respectively, related to corporate clients, included in the real estate category in the tables above and below. Total CRE exposure also includes approximately $9 billion and $9 billion, respectively, related to
Wealth
clients, not included in the tables above and below as they are not considered corporate exposures.
In addition, as of March 31, 2025, approximately 78% of Citi’s total CRE exposure was rated investment grade and more than 78% was to borrowers in the U.S. (unchanged from December 31, 2024).
As of March 31, 2025, the ACLL attributed to the total funded CRE exposure (including
Wealth
) was approximately 1.75%, and there were $645 million of non-accrual CRE loans. As of December 31, 2024, the ACLL attributed to the total funded CRE exposure (including
Wealth
) was approximately 1.60%, and there were $574 million of non-accrual CRE loans.
47
The following table details Citi’s corporate credit portfolio by industry as of December 31, 2024:
(1)    Funded excludes loans carried at fair value of $7.8 billion and HFS of $3.6 billion as of December 31, 2024.
(2)    Unfunded includes lending-related commitments carried at fair value and HFS as of December 31, 2024.
(3)    Includes non-accrual loan exposures and related criticized unfunded exposures.
(4)    Represents the amount of purchased credit protection in the form of derivatives to economically hedge funded and unfunded exposures. Of the $37.8 billion of purchased credit protection, $34.8 billion represents the total notional amount of purchased credit derivatives on individual reference entities. The remaining $3 billion represents the first loss tranche of portfolios of purchased credit derivatives with a total notional amount of $22.9 billion, where the protection seller absorbs the first loss on the referenced loan portfolios.
(5)    Autos total credit exposure includes securitization financing facilities secured by auto loans and leases, extended mainly to the finance company subsidiaries of global auto manufacturers, bank subsidiaries and independent auto finance companies, of approximately $17.5 billion ($10.5 billion of which was funded exposure with 100% rated investment grade) as of December 31, 2024.
(6)    In addition to this exposure, Citi has energy-related exposure within the public sector (e.g., energy-related state-owned entities) and the transportation and industrials sector (e.g., off-shore drilling entities) included in the table above. As of December 31, 2024, Citi’s total exposure to these energy-related entities was approximately $4.4 billion, of which approximately $2.1 billion consisted of direct outstanding funded loans.
(7)    Includes $0.6 billion and $0.1 billion of funded and unfunded exposure at December 31, 2024, respectively, primarily related to commercial credit card delinquency-managed loans.
48
Credit Risk Mitigation
As part of its overall risk management activities, Citigroup uses credit derivatives, both partial and full term, and other risk mitigants to economically hedge portions of the credit risk in its corporate credit portfolio, in addition to outright asset sales. In advance of the expiration of partial-term economic hedges, Citi will determine, among other factors, the economic feasibility of hedging the remaining life of the instrument. The results of the mark-to-market and any realized gains or losses on credit derivatives are reflected primarily in
Principal transactions
in the Consolidated Statement of Income.
At March 31, 2025, December 31, 2024 and March 31, 2024,
Banking
had economic hedges on the corporate credit portfolio of $38.8 billion, $37.8 billion and $38.4 billion, respectively. Citi’s expected credit loss model used in the calculation of its ACL does not include the favorable impact of credit derivatives and other mitigants that are marked-to-market. In addition, the reported amounts of direct outstandings and unfunded lending commitments in the tables above do not reflect the impact of these hedging transactions. The credit protection was economically hedging underlying
Banking
corporate credit portfolio exposures with the following risk rating distribution:
Rating of Hedged Exposure

CONSUMER CREDIT
The following section provides information about Citi’s consumer credit portfolio across
Wealth
,
USPB
and the consumer component of
All Other—
Legacy Franchises.
Wealth
includes consumer loans that are both delinquency and classifiably managed portfolios.
Consumer Credit Portfolio
The following table presents Citi’s quarterly end-of-period consumer loans
(1)
:
(1)
End-of-period loans include interest and fees on credit cards.
(2)
Consists of $96.7 billion, $98.0 billion, $99.8 billion, $100.9 billion and $100.0 billion of loans in North America as of March 31, 2025, December 31, 2024, September 30, 2024, June 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024, respectively. For additional information on the credit quality of the
Wealth
portfolio, see Note 14.
(3)
Consists of $50.6 billion, $49.5 billion, $51.2 billion, $49.5 billion and $48.9 billion of loans outside North America as of March 31, 2025, December 31, 2024, September 30, 2024, June 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024, respectively.
(4)
See Note 14 for details on loan-to-value ratios for the portfolios and FICO scores for the U.S. portfolio.
(5)
At March 31, 2025, includes approximately $25 billion of classifiably managed loans fully collateralized by eligible financial assets and securities that have experienced very low historical net credit losses.
(6)
At March 31, 2025, includes approximately $19 billion of classifiably managed loans. Approximately 84% of these loans are fully collateralized (consisting primarily of commercial real estate and limited partner capital commitments in private equity) and have experienced very low historical net credit losses. As discussed below, approximately 83% of the classifiably managed portion of these loans is investment grade.
(7)
Effective January 1, 2025,
USPB
changed its reporting for certain installment lending products that were transferred from Retail Banking to Branded Cards to reflect where these products are managed. Prior periods were conformed to reflect this change.
(8)
Asia Consumer loan balances, reported within
All Other
—Legacy Franchises, include the three remaining Asia Consumer loan portfolios—Korea, Poland and Russia—as well as China until the completion of the sales of substantially all portfolios in July 2024.
(9)    Primarily consists of certain North America consumer mortgages.
For information on changes to Citi’s consumer loans, see “Credit Risk—Loans” above.
50
Consumer Credit Trends
U.S. Personal Banking (USPB)
includes Branded Cards and Retail Services, with proprietary credit card portfolios (Value, Rewards and Cash), co-branded card portfolios (including Costco and American Airlines) and personal installment loans within Branded Cards, and co-brand and private label relationships (including, among others, The Home Depot, Best Buy, Macy’s and Sears) within Retail Services.
USPB
also includes Retail Banking, which provides traditional banking services including deposits, mortgages and other lending to retail and small business customers. Retail Banking is concentrated in six major U.S. metropolitan areas.
USPB
also provides mortgages through correspondent channels.
As of March 31, 2025, approximately 76% of
USPB
EOP loans consisted of Branded Cards and Retail Services credit card loans, which generally drives the overall credit performance of
USPB
, as Branded Cards and Retail Services card net credit losses represented approximately 96% of
USPB
’s
total net credit losses for the first quarter of 2025. As of March 31, 2025, Branded Cards and Retail Services represented 69% and 31%, respectively, of EOP cards loans in
USPB
.
As presented in the chart above, the first quarter of 2025 net credit loss rate for
USPB
increased
quarter-over-quarter, primarily driven by seasonality, and increased year-over-year, primarily reflecting the continued maturation of multiple cards loan vintages originated in recent years. The maturation was delayed by unprecedented levels of government stimulus during the pandemic. In addition, the year-over-year increase was driven by macroeconomic pressures related to the elevated inflationary and interest rate environment impacting both cards portfolios.
The 90+ days past due delinquency rate was broadly stable quarter-over-quarter and decreased year-over-year. The year-over-year decrease was due to an improvement in the delinquency rate for credit card loans in Retail Services.
USPB
’s Branded Cards portfolio consists of both proprietary Citi branded cards portfolios (Value, Rewards and Cash) and co-branded cards portfolios (including Costco and American Airlines) and personal installment loans. Citi’s Branded Cards portfolio benefits from a diverse combination of products. Citi’s proprietary cards provide customers with a suite of products with rewards, cash rebates and lending solutions, while co-branded cards provide significant affinity benefits through partnerships with large-scale partners across the airline, retail and telecom sectors.
As presented in the chart above, the first quarter of 2025 net credit loss rate for Branded Cards’ credit cards increased quarter-over-quarter, primarily driven by seasonality, and increased year-over-year, primarily reflecting the continued maturation of multiple cards loan vintages originated in recent years. The maturation was delayed by unprecedented levels of government stimulus during the pandemic. In addition, the year-over-year increase was driven by macroeconomic pressures related to the elevated inflationary and interest rate environment.
The 90+ days past due delinquency rate was broadly stable quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year.
USPB
’s
Retail Services partners directly with more than 20 retailers and dealers to offer private label and co-branded cards. Retail Services’ target market focuses on select industry segments such as home improvement, specialty retail,
51
consumer electronics and fuel. Retail Services continually evaluates opportunities to add partners within target industries that have strong loyalty, lending or payment programs and growth potential.

The maturation was delayed by unprecedented levels of government stimulus during the pandemic. In addition, the year-over-year increase was driven by macroeconomic pressures related to the elevated inflationary and interest rate environment.
The 90+ days past due delinquency rate decreased quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year, reflecting continued stabilization in delinquencies.

USPB
’s Retail Banking portfolio consists primarily of consumer mortgages (including home equity) and unsecured lending products, such as small business loans and revolving products. The portfolio is generally delinquency managed, where Citi evaluates credit risk based on FICO scores, delinquencies and the value of underlying collateral. The consumer mortgages in this portfolio have historically been extended to high credit quality customers, generally with loan-to-value ratios that are less than or equal to 80% on first and second mortgages. For additional information, see “Loan-to-Value (LTV) Ratios” in Note 14.
As presented in the chart above, the first quarter of 2025 net credit loss rate for Retail Banking was broadly stable year-over-year and decreased quarter-over-quarter. The quarter-over-quarter decrease was driven by a reduction in the consumer overdraft loss rate.
The 90+ days past due delinquency rate was broadly stable quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year.
Wealth
provides consumer mortgages, margin lending, credit cards and other lending products to customer segments that range from affluent to ultra-high net worth through the Private Bank, Citigold and Wealth at Work businesses. These customer segments represent a target market that is characterized by historically low default rates and delinquencies and includes loans that are delinquency managed or classifiably managed. The delinquency-managed portfolio consists primarily of mortgages, margin lending and credit cards.
As of March 31, 2025, approximately $45 billion, or 30%, of the portfolios were classifiably managed and primarily consisted of mortgage loans, margin loans, personal and small business loans and other lending programs. These classifiably managed loans are primarily evaluated for credit risk based on their internal risk rating, of which 69% were rated investment grade. While the 90+ days past due delinquency rates shown in the chart above were calculated only for the delinquency-managed portfolio, the net credit loss rates presented were calculated using net credit losses for both the delinquency and classifiably managed portfolios.
As presented in the chart above, the first quarter of 2025 net credit loss rate in
Wealth
was broadly stable quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. The 90+ days past due delinquency rate was broadly stable quarter-over-quarter and increased year-over-year, primarily driven by consumer mortgages. The low net credit loss and the 90+ days past due delinquency rates continued to reflect the strong credit profiles of the portfolios.
52
Mexico Consumer operates in Mexico through Banamex and provides credit cards, consumer mortgages and small business and personal loans. Mexico Consumer serves a mass-market segment in Mexico and focuses on developing multiproduct relationships with customers.
As of March 31, 2025, approximately 40% of Mexico Consumer EOP loans consisted of credit card loans, which largely drives the overall credit performance of Mexico Consumer, as the cards net credit losses represented approximately 65% of total Mexico Consumer net credit losses for the first quarter of 2025.
As presented in the chart above, the first quarter of 2025 net credit loss rate in Mexico Consumer increased quarter-over-quarter, driven by a $13 million charge-off for uncollectible value added tax on accrued interest and an increase in settlements. The net credit loss rate increased year-over-year, primarily driven by the ongoing normalization of loss and delinquency rates from post-pandemic lows.
The 90+ days past due delinquency rate was broadly stable quarter-over-quarter and increased year-over-year. The year-over-year increase was driven by the ongoing normalization of loss and delinquency rates from post-pandemic lows.
For additional details on cost of credit, loan delinquency and other information for Citi’s consumer loan portfolios, see each respective business’s results of operations above and Note 14.
U.S. Cards FICO Distribution

Additional Consumer Credit Details
Consumer Loan Delinquencies Amounts and Ratios
(1)
End-of-period (EOP) loans include interest and fees on credit cards.
(2)
The ratios of 90+ days past due and 30–89 days past due are calculated based on EOP loans, net of unearned income.
(3)
Excludes EOP classifiably managed Private Bank loans. These loans are not included in the delinquency numerator, denominator and ratios.
(4)
These loans are evaluated for non-accrual status and write-off primarily based on their internal risk classification and not solely on their delinquency status, and, therefore, delinquency metrics are excluded from this table. As of March 31, 2025, December 31, 2024 and March 31, 2024, 69%, 72% and 81% of
Wealth
classifiably managed loans were rated investment grade. For additional information on the credit quality of the
Wealth
portfolio, including classifiably managed portfolios, see “Consumer Credit Trends” above.
(5)
The 90+ days past due and 30–89 days past due and related ratios for
Retail Banking exclude loans guaranteed by U.S. government-sponsored agencies since the potential risk of loss predominantly resides with the U.S. government-sponsored agencies. The amounts excluded for loans 90+ days past due and (EOP loans) were $64 million ($0.5 billion), $69 million ($0.5 billion) and $64 million ($0.5 billion) at March 31, 2025, December 31, 2024 and March 31, 2024, respectively. The amounts excluded for loans 30–89 days past due (the 30–89 days past due EOP loans have the same adjustments as the 90+ days past due EOP loans) were $59 million, $66 million and $66 million at March 31, 2025, December 31, 2024 and March 31, 2024, respectively. The EOP loans in the table include the guaranteed loans.
54

Asia Consumer also includes delinquencies and loans in Poland and Russia for all periods presented.
(8)
The 90+ days past due and 30–89 days past due and related ratios exclude U.S. mortgage loans that are primarily related to U.S. mortgages guaranteed by U.S. government-sponsored agencies since the potential risk of loss predominantly resides with the U.S. agencies. The amounts excluded for 90+ days past due and (EOP loans) were $62 million ($0.2 billion), $66 million ($0.2 billion) and $66 million ($0.2 billion) at March 31, 2025, December 31, 2024 and March 31, 2024, respectively. The amounts excluded for loans 30–89 days past due (the 30–89 days past due EOP loans have the same adjustments as the 90+ days past due EOP loans) were $32 million, $34 million and $33 million at March 31, 2025, December 31, 2024 and March 31, 2024, respectively. The EOP loans in the table include the guaranteed loans.

59
Non-Accrual Loans and Assets
For additional information on Citi’s non-accrual loans and assets, see “Non-Accrual Loans and Assets” in Citi’s 2024 Form 10-K.
Non-Accrual Loans
The table below summarizes Citigroup’s non-accrual loans (NAL) as of the periods indicated. Non-accrual loans may still be current on interest payments. In situations where Citi reasonably expects that only a portion of the principal owed will ultimately be collected, all payments received are reflected as a reduction of principal and not as interest income. For all other non-accrual loans, cash interest receipts are generally recorded as revenue.
(1)
Corporate loans are placed on non-accrual status based on a review by Citigroup’s risk officers. Corporate non-accrual loans may still be current on interest payments. With limited exceptions, the following practices are applied for consumer loans: consumer loans, excluding credit cards and mortgages, are placed on non-accrual status at 90 days past due and are charged off at 120 days past due; residential mortgage loans are placed on non-accrual status at 90 days past due and written down to net realizable value at 180 days past due. Consistent with industry conventions, Citigroup generally accrues interest on credit card loans until such loans are charged off, which typically occurs at 180 days contractual delinquency. As such, the non-accrual loan disclosures do not include credit card loans, with the exception of certain international portfolios. The balances above represent non-accrual loans within
Corporate loans
and
Consumer loans
on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
(2)
Approximately 65%, 61%, 64%, 68% and 61% of Citi’s corporate non-accrual loans remain current on interest and principal payments at March 31, 2025, December 31, 2024, September 30, 2024, June 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024, respectively.
(3)
The March 31, 2025
total
corporate non-accrual loans represented 0.44% of total corporate loans.
(4)
The decrease at June 30, 2024 was primarily related to commercial real estate loans.
(5)    Asia Consumer includes balances in Korea, Poland and Russia for all periods presented.

LIQUIDITY RISK
For additional information on funding and liquidity at Citi, including objectives and stress testing, see “Liquidity Risk” and “Risk Factors—Liquidity Risks” in Citi’s 2024 Form 10-K.
Overview
Adequate and diverse sources of funding and liquidity are essential to Citi’s businesses. Funding and liquidity risks arise from several factors, many of which are mostly or entirely outside of Citi’s control, such as disruptions in the financial markets, changes in key funding sources, credit spreads, changes in Citi’s credit ratings and macroeconomic, geopolitical and other conditions.
Citi’s funding and liquidity management objectives are aimed at (i) funding its existing asset base, (ii) growing its core businesses, (iii) maintaining sufficient liquidity, structured appropriately, so that Citi can operate under a variety of adverse circumstances, including potential Company-specific and/or market liquidity events in varying durations and severity, and (iv) satisfying regulatory requirements, including, but not limited to, those related to resolution planning. Citigroup’s primary liquidity objectives are established by entity, and in aggregate, across two major categories:
•
Citibank (including Citibank Europe plc, Citibank Singapore Ltd. and Citibank (Hong Kong) Ltd.); and
•
Citi’s non-bank and other entities, including the parent holding company (Citigroup Inc.), Citi’s primary intermediate holding company (Citicorp LLC), Citi’s broker-dealer subsidiaries (including Citigroup Global Markets Inc., Citigroup Global Markets Limited and Citigroup Global Markets Japan Inc.) and other bank and non-bank subsidiaries that are consolidated into Citigroup (including Banamex).
At an aggregate Citigroup level, Citi’s goal is to maintain sufficient funding in amount and tenor to fully fund customer assets and to provide an appropriate amount of cash and high-quality liquid assets (as discussed below), even in times of stress, in order to meet its payment obligations as they come due. The liquidity risk management framework provides that, in addition to the aggregate requirements, certain entities be self-sufficient or net providers of liquidity, including in conditions established under their designated stress tests.
Citi’s primary funding sources include (i) corporate and consumer deposits via Citi’s bank subsidiaries, including Citibank, N.A. (Citibank), (ii) long-term debt (primarily senior and subordinated debt) mainly issued by Citigroup Inc., as the parent, and Citibank, and (iii) stockholders’ equity. These sources may be supplemented by short-term borrowings, primarily in the form of secured funding transactions.
Citi’s funding and liquidity framework, working in concert with overall asset/liability management, helps ensure that there is sufficient liquidity and tenor in the overall liability structure (including funding products) of the Company relative to the liquidity requirements of Citi’s assets. This reduces the risk that liabilities will become due before assets mature or are monetized. The Company holds excess liquidity, primarily in the form of high-quality liquid assets (HQLA), as presented in the table below.
63
High-Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA)
Note: The amounts in the table above are presented on an average basis. For securities, the amounts represent the liquidity value that potentially could be realized and, therefore, exclude any securities that are encumbered and incorporate any haircuts applicable under the U.S. LCR rule. The table above incorporates various restrictions that could limit the transferability of liquidity between legal entities, including Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act. Changes in HQLA line categories from the prior-year period were primarily driven by the reallocation of nontransferable HQLA, which did not change total average HQLA, and thus did not impact Citi’s LCR ratio.
(1)    Foreign government debt includes securities issued or guaranteed by foreign sovereigns, agencies and multilateral development banks. Foreign government debt securities are held largely to support local liquidity requirements and Citi’s local franchises and principally include government bonds from Japan, Korea, the United Kingdom, Mexico and China.
The table above includes average amounts of HQLA held at Citigroup’s operating entities that are eligible for inclusion in the calculation of Citigroup’s consolidated LCR, pursuant to the U.S. LCR rules. These amounts include the HQLA needed to meet the minimum requirements at these entities as well as any amounts in excess of these minimums that are available to be transferred to other entities within Citigroup. Citigroup’s average HQLA decreased quarter-over-quarter as of the first quarter of 2025, primarily driven by a decrease in average wholesale funding.
As of March 31, 2025, Citigroup had approximately $960 billion of available liquidity resources to support client and business needs, including end-of-period HQLA ($554 billion); additional unencumbered HQLA, including excess liquidity held at bank entities that is non-transferable to other entities within Citigroup ($252 billion); and unused borrowing capacity from available assets not already accounted for within Citi’s HQLA to support additional advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) and the Federal Reserve Bank discount window ($154 billion).
Short-Term Liquidity Measurement: Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR)
In addition to internal 30-day liquidity stress testing performed for Citi’s major entities, operating subsidiaries and countries, Citi also monitors its liquidity by reference to the LCR. The table below details the components of Citi’s LCR calculation and HQLA in excess of net outflows for the periods indicated:
Note: The amounts are presented on an average basis.
As of March 31, 2025, Citigroup’s average LCR increased slightly from the quarter ended December 31, 2024.
In addition, considering Citi’s total available liquidity resources at quarter end of $960 billion, Citi maintained approximately $486 billion of excess liquidity resources above the stressed net outflows of approximately $474 billion, presented in the LCR table above.
64
Long-Term Liquidity Measurement: Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR)
The NSFR measures the availability of an institution’s stable funding against the required stable funding in accordance with a calculation required by the rule. The ratio of available stable funding to required stable funding must be greater than 100%.
In general, an institution’s available stable funding includes portions of equity, deposits and long-term debt, while its required stable funding is based on the liquidity characteristics of its assets, derivatives and commitments. Standardized weightings are required to be applied to the various asset and liability classes.
For the quarter ended March 31, 2025, Citigroup’s consolidated NSFR was compliant with the 100% minimum requirement of the rule. (For additional information, see the Consolidated Citigroup NSFR Disclosure for the quarterly periods ended December 31, 2024 and September 30, 2024, on Citi’s Investor Relations website. The Consolidated Citigroup NSFR Disclosure on Citi’s Investor Relations website is not incorporated by reference into, and does not form any part of, this Form 10-Q).
Select Balance Sheet Items
This section provides details of select liquidity-related assets and liabilities reported on Citigroup’s Consolidated Balance Sheet.
Cash and Investments
The table below details average and end-of-period
Cash and due from banks
,
Deposits with banks
(collectively cash) and
Investment securities
. Citi’s investment securities portfolio consists largely of highly liquid U.S. Treasury, U.S. agency and other sovereign bonds, with an aggregate duration of less than three years. EOP cash, deposits and investments increased 1% quarter-over-quarter, primarily driven by an increase in deposits late in the current quarter.
At March 31, 2025, Citi’s EOP cash and
Investment securities
comprised approximately 30% of total assets.
Deposits
The table below details the average deposits, by segment and/or business, and the total Citigroup end-of-period deposits for each of the periods indicated:
(1)
During the third quarter of 2024, approximately $9 billion of institutional deposits were moved from
Markets
to
All Other—
Corporate/Other. Prior periods were not reclassified. For additional information about the reallocated deposits, see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Citi’s 2024 Form 10-K.
Citi’s deposit base is spread across a diversified set of countries, industries, clients and currencies and is subject to Citi’s Liquidity Risk Management Policy and Procedures.
End-of-period deposits increased 1% year-over-year, driven by increases in
Services
, partially offset by declines in
Wealth
,
All Other
and
USPB
. End-of-period deposits increased 2% sequentially, driven by
Services
and
USPB
, partially offset by a decline in
Wealth.
On an average basis, deposits decreased 2% year-over-year and decreased 1% sequentially. In the first quarter of 2025, average deposits for:
•
Services
increased 2% year-over-year, as TTS increased 1%, due to deepened client relationships and growth in operational deposits, and Securities Services increased 10%, driven by growth in Custody and Issuer Services.
•
USPB
decreased 11% year-over-year, as the transfer of certain relationships and the associated deposits to
Wealth
more than offset underlying deposit growth.
•
Wealth
decreased 2% year-over-year, driven by a shift in deposits to higher-yielding investments on Citi’s platform and other operating outflows, largely offset by the transfer of certain relationships and associated deposits from
USPB
.
•
All Other
decreased 16% year-over-year, primarily reflecting the continued wind-downs, the impact of FX translation of deposits in Legacy Franchises and reductions of corporate certificates of deposit in Corporate/Other.
65
The majority of Citi’s $1.3 trillion of end-of-period deposits are institutional (approximately $851 billion) and span approximately 90 countries. A large majority of these institutional deposits are within TTS, and of these, approximately 80% are from clients that use all three TTS integrated services: payments and collections, liquidity management and working capital solutions. In addition, approximately 80% of TTS deposits are from clients that have a longer than 15-year relationship with Citi.
Citi also has a strong consumer and wealth deposit base, with approximately $401 billion of
Wealth
and
USPB
deposits as of the end of the current quarter, which are diversified across the Private Bank, Citigold and Wealth at Work within
Wealth
, as well as
USPB
, and across regions and products. As of the end of the current quarter, approximately 67% of U.S. Citigold clients have been with Citi for more than 10 years and approximately 44% of Private Bank ultra-high net worth clients have been with Citi for more than 10 years. In addition,
USPB
’s
deposits are spread across six key metropolitan areas in the U.S.
Long-Term Debt
Long-Term Debt Outstanding
The following table presents Citi’s end-of-period total long-term debt outstanding for each of the dates indicated:
Note: Amounts represent the current value of long-term debt on Citi’s Consolidated Balance Sheet that, for certain debt instruments, includes consideration of fair value, hedging impacts and unamortized discounts and premiums.
(1)
Non-bank includes long-term debt issued to third parties by the parent holding company (Citigroup) and Citi’s non-bank subsidiaries (including broker-dealer subsidiaries) that are consolidated into Citigroup. As of March 31, 2025, non-bank included $92.8 billion of long-term debt issued by Citi’s broker-dealer and other subsidiaries that are consolidated into Citigroup. Certain Citigroup consolidated hedging activities are also included in this line.
(2)
Local country and other includes debt issued by Citi’s affiliates in support of their local operations. Within non-bank, certain secured financing is also included.
(3)
Predominantly credit card securitizations, primarily backed by Branded Cards receivables.
Citi’s total long-term debt outstanding increased 4% year-over-year, driven by higher benchmark debt issuances by both bank and non-bank entities. Sequentially, long-term debt outstanding increased 3%, largely related to issuances in benchmark debt and customer-related debt at non-bank entities.
As part of its liability management, Citi has considered, and may continue to consider, opportunities to redeem or repurchase its long-term debt pursuant to open market purchases, tender offers or other means. Such redemptions and repurchases help reduce Citi’s overall funding costs. During the first quarter of 2025, Citi redeemed or repurchased an aggregate of $14.7 billion of its outstanding long-term debt.
66
Long-Term Debt Issuances and Maturities
The table below details Citi’s long-term debt issuances and maturities (including repurchases and redemptions) during the periods presented:
The table below details Citi’s aggregate long-term debt maturities (including repurchases and redemptions) during the three months of 2025, as well as its aggregate expected remaining long-term debt maturities by year as of March 31, 2025:
67
Secured Funding Transactions and Short-Term Borrowings
Citi supplements its primary sources of funding with short-term financings that generally include (i) secured funding transactions consisting of securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase, i.e., repos, and (ii) to a lesser extent, short-term borrowings consisting of commercial paper issuances and borrowings from the FHLB and other market participants.
Secured Funding Transactions
Secured funding is primarily accessed through Citi’s broker-dealer subsidiaries, with a smaller portion executed through Citi’s bank entities to efficiently fund both (i) secured lending activity and (ii) a portion of the securities inventory held in the context of market making and customer activities. Secured funding transactions are predominantly collateralized by government debt securities. Generally, changes in the level of Citi’s secured funding are primarily due to fluctuations in secured lending activity in the matched book (as described below) and changes in securities inventory. In order to maintain reliable funding under a wide range of market conditions, Citi manages risks related to its secured funding by establishing secured funding limits and conducting daily stress tests that account for risks related to capacity, tenor, haircut, collateral type, counterparty and client actions.
Secured funding of $404 billion as of March 31, 2025 increased 35% year-over-year and increased 59% from the prior quarter, largely driven by additional financing to support increases in trading-related assets within Citi’s broker-dealer subsidiaries. As of the quarter ended March 31, 2025, on an average basis, secured funding was $372 billion. The portion of secured funding in the broker-dealer subsidiaries that funds secured lending is commonly referred to as “matched book” activity and is primarily secured by high-quality liquid securities such as U.S. Treasury securities, U.S. agency securities and foreign government debt securities. Other “matched book” activity is secured by less liquid securities, including equity securities, corporate bonds and asset-backed securities, the tenor of which is generally equal to or longer than the tenor of the corresponding assets. As indicated above, the remaining portion of secured funding is used to fund securities inventory held in the context of market making and customer activities.
Short-Term Borrowings
Citi’s short-term borrowings of $49 billion as of March 31, 2025 increased 54% year-over-year and 1% sequentially, compared to December 31, 2024. The year-over-year increase was mainly attributable to additional funding raised by non-bank entities to support client activities. See Note 18 for further information on Citigroup’s and its affiliates’ outstanding short-term borrowings.

Credit Ratings
The table below presents the current ratings for Citigroup and Citibank as of March 31, 2025. While not included in the table below, the current long-term and short-term ratings of Citigroup Global Markets Holdings Inc. (CGMHI) were A+/F1 at Fitch Ratings, A2/P-1 at Moody’s Ratings and A/A-1 at S&P Global Ratings as of March 31, 2025.
Ratings as of March 31, 2025
Potential Impacts of Ratings Downgrades
Ratings downgrades by Fitch, Moody’s or S&P could negatively impact Citigroup’s and/or Citibank’s funding and liquidity due to reduced funding capacity, including derivative triggers, which could take the form of cash obligations and collateral requirements.
For additional information on the impact of credit rating changes on Citi and its applicable subsidiaries, see “Risk Factors—Liquidity Risks” and “Credit Ratings” in Citi’s 2024 Form 10-K.
Citigroup Inc. and Citibank—Potential Derivative Triggers
As of March 31, 2025, Citi estimates that a hypothetical one-notch downgrade of the senior debt/long-term rating across all three major rating agencies could impact funding and liquidity due to derivative triggers by approximately $0.1 billion, unchanged from December 31, 2024, for Citigroup Inc., and $0.1 billion, unchanged from December 31, 2024, for Citibank. Other funding sources, such as secured financing transactions and other margin requirements, for which there are no explicit triggers, could also be adversely affected.
In total, as of March 31, 2025, Citi estimates that a one-notch downgrade of Citigroup Inc. and Citibank across all three major rating agencies could result in increased aggregate cash obligations and collateral requirements of approximately $0.2 billion, unchanged from December 31, 2024. As detailed under “High-Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA)” above, Citigroup has various liquidity resources available to its bank and non-bank entities in part as a contingency for the potential events described above.
Citibank—Additional Potential Impacts
In addition to the above derivative triggers, Citi believes that a potential downgrade of Citibank’s senior debt/long-term rating across any of the three major rating agencies could also have an adverse impact on the commercial paper/short-term rating of Citibank. Citibank has provided liquidity commitments to consolidated asset-backed commercial paper conduits (ABCP), primarily in the form of asset purchase agreements. As of March 31, 2025, Citibank had liquidity commitments of approximately $13.6 billion to consolidated asset-backed commercial paper conduits (compared to $14.9 billion at December 31, 2024) (see Note 21).
In addition to the above-referenced liquidity resources of certain Citibank entities, Citibank could reduce the funding and liquidity risk, if any, of the potential downgrades described above through mitigating actions, including repricing or reducing certain commitments to commercial paper conduits. In the event of the potential downgrades described above, Citi believes that certain corporate customers could re-evaluate borrowing behavior through the conduits. A reduction in client borrowing would result in a reduced amount of ABCP issuance.

MARKET RISK
Market risk arises from both Citi’s trading and non-trading portfolios. For additional information on market risk and market risk management at Citi, see “Market Risk—Overview” and “Risk Factors” in Citi’s 2024 Form 10-K.
MARKET RISK OF NON-TRADING PORTFOLIOS
Market risk from non-trading portfolios stems predominantly from the potential impact of changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates on Citi’s net interest income and on Citi’s
Accumulated
other comprehensive income (loss) (AOCI)
from its investment securities portfolios. Market risk from non-trading portfolios also includes the potential impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on Citi’s capital invested in foreign currencies.
For interest rate risk purposes, Citi’s non-trading portfolios are referred to as the Banking Book, and Citi uses multiple metrics to measure its Banking Book interest rate risk, including Interest Rate Exposure (IRE). For additional information, see “Market Risk—Market Risk of Non-Trading Portfolios—Banking Book Interest Rate Risk” in Citi’s 2024 Form 10-K.
70
Interest Rate Risk of Investment Portfolios—Impact on
AOCI
Citi measures the potential impacts of changes in interest rates on the value of its
AOCI
, which can in turn impact Citi’s common equity and tangible common equity. This will impact Citi’s CET1 and other regulatory capital ratios. Citi seeks to manage its exposure to changes in the market level of interest rates, while limiting the potential impact on its
AOCI
and regulatory capital position.
AOCI
at risk is managed as part of the Company-wide interest rate risk position.
AOCI
at risk considers potential changes in
AOCI
(and the corresponding impact on the CET1 Capital ratio) relative to Citi’s capital generation capacity.
Citi uses 100 basis point (bps) shocks in each scenario to reflect its net interest income sensitivity to unanticipated changes in market interest rates, as potential monetary policy decisions and changes in economic conditions may be reflected in current market-implied forward rates.
The following table presents the 12-month estimated impact to Citi’s net interest income,
AOCI
and the CET1 Capital ratio, each assuming an unanticipated parallel instantaneous 100 bps increase in interest rates:
(1)
Excludes trading book and fair value option banking book portfolios and replaces them with the associated transfer pricing.
(2)
Includes the effect of changes in interest rates on
AOCI
related to investment securities, cash flow hedges and pension liability adjustments.
(3)
Excludes the effect of changes in interest rates on
AOCI
related to cash flow hedges, as those changes are excluded from CET1 Capital.
As presented in the table above, Citi’s balance sheet is asset sensitive (assets reprice faster than liabilities), resulting in higher net interest income in increasing interest rate scenarios. The estimated impact to Citi’s net interest income in a 100 bps upward rate shock scenario as of March 31, 2025 remained relatively stable year-over-year and continued to reflect the IRE sensitivity of non-U.S. dollar currencies. At progressively higher interest rate levels, the marginal net interest income benefit is lower, as Citi assumes it will pass on a larger share of rate changes to depositors (i.e., higher betas), further reducing Citi’s IRE sensitivity. Currency-specific interest rate changes and balance sheet factors may drive quarter-to-quarter volatility in Citi’s estimated IRE for a 100 bps upward rate shock.
All other currencies of $1.5 billion as of March 31, 2025 in the table above includes the impact from the following top five non-U.S. dollar currencies by absolute size: approximately $(0.1) billion from the euro, $0.2 billion from the British pound sterling and Japanese yen, and approximately $0.1 billion each from the Chinese yuan and Indian rupee. The remaining impact is spread across more than 30 additional currencies.
In a 100 bps upward rate shock scenario, Citi expects that the approximate $1.2 billion initial negative impact to
AOCI
could potentially be offset in shareholders’ equity through the expected recovery of the impact on
AOCI
through accretion of Citi’s investment portfolio and expected net interest income benefit over a period of approximately seven months.
71
Scenario Analysis
The following table presents the estimated impact to Citi’s net interest income and
AOCI
under eight different interest rate scenarios for the U.S. dollar and all other currencies in which Citi has invested capital as of March 31, 2025. The 100 bps and 200 bps downward rate scenarios potentially may be impacted by the low level of interest rates in several countries and the assumption that market interest rates, as well as rates paid to depositors and charged to borrowers, do not fall below zero (i.e., the “flooring assumption”). The interest rate scenarios are also impacted by convexity related to mortgage products and deposit pricing.
Note: Each scenario assumes that the rate change will occur instantaneously. Changes in interest rates for maturities between the overnight rate and the 10-year rate are interpolated. The interest rate exposure in the table above assumes no change in deposit size or mix from the baseline forecast included in the different interest rate scenarios presented. As a result, in higher interest rate scenarios, customer activity resulting in a shift from non-interest-bearing and low interest rate deposit products to higher-yielding deposits would reduce the expected benefit to net interest income. Conversely, in lower interest rate scenarios, customer activity resulting in a shift from higher-yielding deposits to non-interest-bearing and low interest rate deposit products would reduce the expected decrease to net interest income.
(1)
The Scenario 1 impact of $1,470 million consists of the following top five non-U.S. dollar currencies as of March 31, 2025 by absolute size: approximately $(0.1) billion from the euro, $0.2 billion from the British pound sterling and Japanese yen, and approximately $0.1 billion each from the Chinese yuan and Indian rupee. The remaining balance is spread across more than 30 additional currencies.
(2)
Includes the effect of changes in interest rates on
AOCI
related to investment securities, cash flow hedges and pension liability adjustments.
As presented in the table above, the estimated impact to Citi’s net interest income is larger in the short end compared to the long end as Citi’s Banking Book has relatively higher interest rate exposure to the short end of the yield curve. For the U.S. dollar, exposure to downward rate shocks is larger in magnitude than to upward rate shocks. This is because of the lower benefit to net interest income from Citi’s deposit base at higher rate levels, as well as the prepayment effects on mortgage loans and mortgage-backed securities.
The magnitude of the impact to
AOCI
is greater in the short end compared to the long end. This is because Citi’s investment portfolio and pension liabilities are more sensitive to rates at shorter- and intermediate-term maturities.
72
Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates—Impacts on
AOCI
and Capital
As of March 31, 2025, Citi estimates that an unanticipated parallel instantaneous 5% appreciation of the U.S. dollar against all of the other currencies in which Citi has invested capital could reduce Citi’s tangible common equity (TCE) by approximately $1.5 billion, or 1.0%, as a result of changes to Citi’s CTA in
AOCI
, net of hedges. This reduction in the TCE would be primarily driven by depreciation in the value of the euro, Mexican peso and Indian rupee.
This reduction in the TCE does not reflect any mitigating actions Citi may take, including ongoing management of its foreign currency translation exposure. TCE is used as a simplified metric to manage CET1 capital ratio volatility. Specifically, as currency movements change the value of Citi’s net investments in foreign currency-denominated
capital, these movements also change the value of Citi’s RWA denominated in those same currencies. This, coupled with Citi’s foreign currency hedging strategies, such as foreign currency borrowings, foreign currency forwards and other currency hedging instruments, lessens the impact of foreign currency movements on Citi’s CET1 Capital ratio. Changes in these hedging strategies, as well as hedging costs, divestitures and tax impacts, can further affect the actual impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on Citi’s capital compared to an unanticipated parallel shock, as described above.
The effect of Citi’s ongoing management strategies with respect to quarterly changes in foreign exchange rates (versus the U.S. dollar), and the quarterly impact of these changes on Citi’s TCE and CET1 Capital ratio, are presented in the table below. See Note 19 for additional information on the changes in
AOCI
.
(1)     FX spot rate change is a weighted average based on Citi’s quarterly average GAAP capital exposure to foreign countries. A negative change in FX spot rate represents foreign currency depreciation versus the U.S. dollar.

Interest Income/Expense and Net Interest Margin (NIM)
(1)
Interest income
and
Net interest income
include the taxable equivalent gross-up adjustments (TEGU) primarily related to the tax-exempt bond portfolio and certain tax-advantaged loan programs of $26 million, $25 million and $23 million for the three months ended March 31, 2025, December 31, 2024 and March 31, 2024, respectively.
(2)
Interest expense associated with certain hybrid financial instruments, which are classified as
Long-term debt
and accounted for at fair value, is reported together with any changes in fair value as part of
Principal transactions
in the Consolidated Statement of Income and is therefore not reflected in
Interest expense
in the table above.
(3)
The average rate on interest income and NIM reflects TEGU. See footnote 1 above.
(4)
Citi’s NIM is calculated by dividing net interest income (including TEGU) by average interest-earning assets.
74
Non-
Markets
Net Interest Income
(1)
Interest income
and
Net interest income
include TEGU discussed in the table above.
Citi’s net interest income in the first quarter of 2025 was $14.0 billion, on both a reported and taxable equivalent basis, an increase of 4%, or $0.5 billion, from the prior-year period. The increases were primarily driven by an 18%, or $0.3 billion, increase in
Markets
net interest income and a 2%, or $0.2 billion, increase in non
-Markets
net interest income
.
The increase in
Markets
net interest income was primarily driven by lower funding costs, as well as higher trading inventory in Fixed Income Markets, partially offset by lower net interest income from structured notes due to lower interest rates.
The increase in non-
Markets
net interest income was largely due to loan growth in Branded Cards and higher deposit spreads in Retail Banking in
USPB
, as well as higher deposit spreads in
Wealth
and
Services
. The impact of these drivers was partially offset by lower net interest income in
All Other
, driven by Mexican peso depreciation and a decrease in Corporate Treasury investment securities.
Citi’s net interest margin was 2.47% on a taxable equivalent basis in the first quarter of 2025, an increase from 2.42% in the prior quarter, largely driven by a more favorable asset mix and higher
Markets
net interest margin.

MARKET RISK OF TRADING PORTFOLIOS
Value at Risk (VaR)
Citi believes its VaR model is conservatively calibrated to incorporate fat-tail scaling and the greater of short-term (approximately the most recent month) and long-term (18 months for commodities and three years for others) market volatility. As of March 31, 2025, Citi estimates that the conservative features of the VaR calibration contribute an approximate 17% add-on to what would be a VaR estimated under the assumption of stable and perfectly, normally distributed markets. As of December 31, 2024, the add-on was 24%.
As presented in the table below, Citi’s average trading VaR for the first quarter of 2025 remained unchanged from the fourth quarter of 2024 despite VaR changes within asset classes from inventory changes and volatility updates.
Quarter-end and Average Trading VaR and Trading and Credit Portfolio VaR
(1)    Covariance adjustment (also known as diversification benefit) equals the difference between the total VaR and the sum of the VaRs tied to each risk type. The benefit reflects the fact that the risks within individual and across risk types are not perfectly correlated and, consequently, the total VaR on a given day will be lower than the sum of the VaRs relating to each risk type. The determination of the primary drivers of changes to the covariance adjustment is made by an examination of the impact of both model parameter and position changes.
(2)    The total trading VaR includes mark-to-market and certain fair value option trading positions with the exception of hedges of the loan portfolio, fair value option loans and all CVA exposures. Available-for-sale and accrual exposures are not included.
(3)    The specific risk-only component represents the level of equity and fixed income issuer-specific risk embedded in VaR.
(4)    The credit portfolio is composed of mark-to-market positions associated with non-trading business units, with the CVA relating to derivative counterparties, all associated CVA hedges and market sensitivity FVA hedges. FVA and DVA are not included. The credit portfolio also includes hedges of the loan portfolio, fair value option loans and hedges of the leveraged finance pipeline within capital markets origination.
The table below provides the range of market factor VaRs associated with Citi’s total trading VaR, inclusive of specific risk:
Note: No covariance adjustment can be inferred from the above table as the high and low for each market factor will be from different close-of-business dates.
79
The following table provides the VaR for
Markets
, excluding the CVA relating to derivative counterparties, hedges of CVA, fair value option loans and hedges of the loan portfolio:
Regulatory VaR Back-Testing
In accordance with Basel III, Citi is required to perform back-testing to evaluate the effectiveness of its Regulatory VaR model. Regulatory VaR back-testing is the process in which the daily one-day VaR, at a 99% confidence interval, is compared to the buy-and-hold profit and loss (i.e., the profit and loss impact if the portfolio is held constant at the end of the day and re-priced the following day). Buy-and-hold profit and loss represents the daily mark-to-market profit and loss attributable to price movements in covered positions from the close of the previous business day. Buy-and-hold profit and loss excludes realized trading revenue, net interest, fees and commissions, intra-day trading profit and loss and changes in reserves.
Based on a 99% confidence level, Citi would expect two to three days in any one year where buy-and-hold losses exceed the Regulatory VaR. Given the conservative calibration of Citi’s VaR model (as a result of taking the greater of short- and long-term volatilities and fat-tail scaling of volatilities), Citi would expect fewer exceptions under normal and stable market conditions. Periods of unstable market conditions could increase the number of back-testing exceptions.
As of March 31, 2025, there were no back-testing exceptions observed for Citi’s Regulatory VaR in the last 12 months.
OTHER RISKS
For additional information regarding other risks, including Citi’s management of other risks, see “Managing Global Risk—Other Risks” in Citi’s 2024 Form 10-K.
Country Risk
Country risk is defined as the exposure to potential loss caused by economic, financial or sociopolitical conditions or weaknesses in legal systems in a country or jurisdiction that Citi may be exposed to through its business activities. Country risk may impair the value of Citi’s franchise within a country or jurisdiction or adversely affect the ability of Citi to enforce the obligations of its obligors. Citi is exposed to country risk through its business activities such as lending, payments, investing and market-making activities, whether cross-border or locally funded, and including activity with corporations, governments and institutions in a country or jurisdiction.
Citi manages country risk through a comprehensive risk framework supported by governance committees and councils that oversee country risk exposures, including but not limited to relevant limits, concentrations, metrics and frameworks, stress testing, significant country developments and risk mitigation actions. This is supported by tools and processes designed to facilitate the objective, consistent and ongoing assessments of individual countries and jurisdictions and the risks that may arise from Citi’s business activities within them.
80
Top 25 Country Exposures
The following table presents Citi’s top 25 exposures by country (excluding the U.S.) as of March 31, 2025.
(Citi’s combined top 25 exposures by country and the U.S. represent 94% of Citi’s exposure to all countries as of March 31, 2025.)
Citi’s top 25 exposures by country may fluctuate from period to period due to a variety of factors, including client activity, market flows, FX fluctuations and liquidity management activities undertaken by Citi’s businesses.
For purposes of the table, beginning this quarter, amounts are reflected based on the country of risk of the obligor. In prior quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and annual reports on Form 10-K, amounts were reflected in the table in the country of the Citi booking center in which each transaction was booked. Prior periods have been conformed to reflect this
change, which provides a more meaningful risk view by aligning the country attribution with the country or jurisdiction where the risk lies. This change also aligns the disclosure with how risk is viewed, measured and managed by Citi.
The country of risk will generally be the same as the country of incorporation of the obligor, except in certain situations, such as where the source of repayment is concentrated in a different country or jurisdiction or where the obligor is guaranteed by a parent entity incorporated in a different country or jurisdiction (e.g., a Swiss-incorporated subsidiary that is guaranteed by a Chinese-incorporated parent would be reflected as China risk).
Investment securities and trading account assets are generally categorized based on the domicile of the issuer of the security of the underlying reference entity.
(1)    Other funded includes other direct exposures such as loans HFS, other loans in Corporate/Other and investments accounted for under the equity method.
(2)    Unfunded commitments include unfunded corporate lending commitments, letters of credit and other contingencies, including clearing house guarantee funds.
(3)    Net counterparty exposure includes mark-to-market (MTM) exposures on OTC derivatives, carrying amounts of securities lending/borrowing transactions (repos) and margin loan balances. This exposure is also net of collateral and inclusive of CVA.
(4)    Investment securities include debt securities AFS, recorded at fair market value, and debt securities HTM, recorded at amortized cost.
(5)    Trading account assets are represented on a net basis and include issuer risk on both long and short debt and equity securities and derivative exposure.

Russia
Overview
Citi previously ended nearly all of the institutional banking services it offered in Russia and ceased soliciting any new business or new clients in the country, with the remaining services only those necessary to fulfill its remaining legal and regulatory obligations, as well as support its employees.
In addition, Citi significantly reduced its
All Other
—Legacy Franchises consumer loan portfolio in Russia (reported as part of Asia Consumer), largely due to loan portfolio sales and its entry into a credit card referral agreement with a Russian bank. For additional information, see “Citi’s Wind-Down of Its Russia Operations” below.
Citi’s remaining operations are conducted through
Services
,
Markets
,
Banking
and
All Other
—Legacy Franchises. Citi continues to monitor the war in Ukraine, related sanctions and economic conditions and continues to mitigate its Russia exposures and risks as appropriate.
For additional information about Citi’s risks related to its Russia exposures, see “Risk Factors—Market-Related Risks,” “—Operational Risks” and “—Other Risks” in Citi’s 2024 Form 10-K.
Impact of the Russia–Ukraine War on Citi’s Businesses
Russia-related Balance Sheet Exposures
Citi’s remaining domestic operations in Russia are conducted through a subsidiary of Citibank, AO Citibank, which uses the Russian ruble as its functional currency.
The following table summarizes Citi’s and its clients’ Russia-related exposures:
(1)    Investment securities include debt securities AFS, recorded at fair market value, primarily local government debt securities.
(2)    Cash on deposit and placements are primarily with the Central Bank of Russia. Due to sanctions restrictions, as well as Citi being unable to enter into reverse repos beginning in the third quarter of 2024, any excess liquidity is placed with the Central Bank of Russia.
(3)    Represents dividends relating to Russian securities held by Citi in its role as custodian for clients in Russia, which Citi is required by local regulation to hold at the DIA. Citi is unable to remit these funds, which are held at clients’ risk, to these clients due to restrictions imposed by the Russian government.
(4)    Clients’ exposure of $9.0 billion as of March 31, 2025 primarily consists of corporate dividends that Citi cannot remit to its clients due to restrictions imposed by the Russian government and are held with the DIA.
(5)    Citigroup’s CTA loss of $1.6 billion as of March 31, 2025 included in its
AOCI
related to its indirect subsidiary, AO Citibank, and $1.1 billion of intercompany liabilities owed by AO Citibank to other Citi entities outside Russia are excluded from the above table. Citi has separately described these amounts in “Deconsolidation Risk” below.
82
During the first quarter of 2025, Citi’s Russia-related exposures increased $0.4 billion to $2.0 billion and total clients’ exposures increased $1.6 billion to $9.0 billion, both primarily driven by appreciation of the Russian ruble. As discussed in the table above, clients’ exposures primarily consist of corporate dividends that Citi cannot remit to its clients due to restrictions imposed by the Russian government and are held with the DIA at clients’ risk.
Citi’s net investment in Russia was less than $0.1 billion as of March 31, 2025 (unchanged from December 31, 2024). Citi hedges its Russian ruble/U.S. dollar spot FX exposure in
AOCI
through the purchase of FX derivatives. The ongoing mark-to-market of the hedging derivatives is also reported in
AOCI
. When the Russian ruble depreciates against the U.S. dollar, the U.S. dollar equivalent value of Citigroup’s investment in AO Citibank also declines. This change in value is offset by the change in value of the hedging instrument (FX derivative). Going forward, Citi may record devaluations on its net ruble-denominated assets in earnings, without the benefit from a change in the fair value of derivative positions used to economically hedge the exposures.

As of March 31, 2025, Citigroup’s ACL included less than $0.1 billion of remaining credit reserves for Citi’s direct Russian counterparties (largely unchanged from December 31, 2024). This ACL balance for Citi’s direct Russian counterparties does not include the additional reserves for transfer risk associated with exposures in Russia, which are included in the ACL on

Citi’s Wind-Down of Its Russia Operations
In August 2022, Citi disclosed its decision to wind down its Russia consumer, local commercial and institutional banking businesses, including actively pursuing portfolio sales. In connection with this wind-down, Citi has incurred approximately $82 million to date in charges, largely from restructuring, vendor termination fees and other related charges. Citi expects to incur an additional approximate $21 million in estimated charges (in
All Other
,
excluding the impact from any portfolio sales). For additional information about Citi’s continued efforts to reduce its operations and exposure in Russia, see “Risk Factors” and “Managing Global Risk—Other Risks—Country Risk—Russia” in Citi’s 2024 Form 10-K.
Deconsolidation Risk
Citi’s remaining operations in Russia subject it to various risks, including, among others, foreign currency volatility, including appreciation or devaluation; restrictions arising from retaliatory Russian laws and regulations on the conduct of its business; sanctions or asset freezes; or other deconsolidation events (see “Risk Factors—Other Risks” in Citi’s 2024 Form 10-K).
As of March 31, 2025, Citi continued to consolidate AO Citibank because none of the deconsolidation factors were triggered. Examples of factors that may result in deconsolidation of AO Citibank include voluntary or forced sale of ownership or loss of control due to actions of relevant governmental authorities, including expropriation (i.e., the entity becomes subject to the complete control of a government, court, administrator, trustee or regulator); revocation of banking license; and loss of ability to elect a board of directors or appoint members of senior management.
In the event Citi deems there is a loss of control, for example, through expropriation of AO Citibank, Citi would be required to (i) write off the net investment of less than $0.1 billion (unchanged from December 31, 2024), (ii) recognize a CTA loss of approximately $1.6 billion (unchanged from December 31, 2024) through earnings and (iii) recognize a loss of $1.1 billion (an increase of $0.2 billion from December 31, 2024) on intercompany liabilities owed by AO Citibank to other Citi entities outside Russia. In the sole event of a substantial liquidation, as opposed to a loss of control, Citi would be required to recognize the CTA loss of approximately $1.6 billion through earnings and would evaluate its remaining net investment as circumstances evolve. The $1.6 billion CTA write-off through earnings under either event is expected to be largely equity neutral, since the reversal of the CTA loss out of
AOCI
would improve Citi’s total
AOCI
.

Ukraine
Citi has continued to operate in Ukraine throughout the war through its
Services
,
Markets
and
Banking
businesses, serving the local subsidiaries of multinationals, along with local financial institutions and the public sector. Citi employs approximately 220 people in Ukraine and their safety is Citi’s top priority. All of Citi’s domestic operations in Ukraine are conducted through a subsidiary of Citibank, which uses the Ukrainian hryvnia as its functional currency. As of March 31, 2025, Citi had $1.6 billion of direct exposures related to Ukraine (a decrease of $0.1 billion from December 31, 2024).
83
Argentina
Citi operates in Argentina through its
Services
,
Markets
and
Banking
businesses. As of March 31, 2025, Citi’s net investment in its Argentine operations was approximately $1.6 billion (compared to $1.5 billion at December 31, 2024). Citi uses Argentina’s official market exchange rate to remeasure its net Argentine peso (ARS)–denominated assets into U.S. dollars (USD), with the impact of exchange rate fluctuations recorded directly in earnings. As of March 31, 2025, the official ARS exchange rate was 1,074, which devalued by 4% against the USD during the first quarter of 2025.
The Central Bank of Argentina (BCRA) has generally maintained certain capital and currency controls that have broadly restricted Citi’s ability to access USD in Argentina and remit earnings from its Argentine operations. On April 11, 2025, the government of Argentina executed an extended funding facility with the International Monetary Fund, pursuant to which the government announced certain measures related to its historical capital and currency controls. Specifically, the government announced that it will allow the official exchange rate to fluctuate between 1,000 and 1,400 ARS per USD, that exchange restrictions are removed for individuals (though are still applicable to local institutions) and that 2025 earnings may be remitted in 2026, through ordinary dividends. Additionally, the BCRA has announced that it will issue a new series of certain USD-denominated bonds (BOPREALs), similar to the prior year, which provides a mechanism to remit dividends up to a certain amount in 2025 through the purchase and subsequent sale of the bonds and remittance of the bond proceeds.
Nonetheless, the historical and ongoing capital and currency controls have resulted in indirect foreign exchange mechanisms that some Argentine entities may use to obtain USD, often at rates that are significantly higher than Argentina’s official exchange rate. If the official exchange rate converges with the approximate rate implied by the indirect foreign exchange mechanisms, Citi could incur additional translation losses on its net investment in Argentina.
Of the $1.6 billion net investment in Argentina as of March 31, 2025, Citi’s net ARS exposure was approximately $1.1 billion (unchanged from December 31, 2024).
As of March 31, 2025, Citi hedged approximately $0.2 billion of its ARS exposure through offshore hedges, and Citi was unable to hedge its remaining exposure, given illiquidity in the offshore derivatives market.

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES
This section contains a summary of Citi’s most significant accounting policies. Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Citi’s 2024 Form 10-K contains a summary of all of Citigroup’s significant accounting policies. These policies, as well as estimates made by management, are integral to the presentation of Citi’s results of operations and financial condition. While all of these policies require a certain level of management judgment and estimates, this section highlights and discusses the significant accounting policies that require management to make highly difficult, complex or subjective judgments and estimates at times regarding matters that are inherently uncertain and susceptible to change (see also “Risk Factors—Operational Risks” in Citi’s 2024 Form 10-K). Management has discussed each of these significant accounting policies, the related estimates and its judgments with the Audit Committee of the Citigroup Board of Directors.
Valuations of Financial Instruments
Citigroup holds debt and equity securities, derivatives, retained interests in securitizations, investments in private equity and other financial instruments. A portion of these assets and liabilities is reflected at fair value on Citi’s Consolidated Balance Sheet as
Trading account assets
,
Available-for-sale securities
and
Trading account liabilities
.
Citi purchases securities under agreements to resell (reverse repos or resale agreements) and sells securities under agreements to repurchase (repos), a substantial portion of which is carried at fair value. In addition, certain loans, short-term borrowings, long-term debt and deposits, as well as certain securities borrowed and loaned positions that are collateralized with cash, are carried at fair value. Citigroup holds its investments, trading assets and liabilities, and resale and repurchase agreements on Citi’s Consolidated Balance Sheet to meet customer needs and to manage liquidity needs, interest rate risks and private equity investing.
When available, Citi generally uses quoted market prices to determine fair value and classifies such items within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy established under ASC 820-10,
Fair Value Measurement
. If quoted market prices are not available, fair value is based on internally developed valuation models that use, where possible, current market-based or independently sourced market parameters, such as interest rates, currency rates and option volatilities. Such models are often based on a discounted cash flow analysis. In addition, items valued using such internally generated valuation techniques are classified according to the lowest level input or value driver that is significant to the valuation. Thus, an item may be classified under the fair value hierarchy as Level 3 even though there may be some significant inputs that are readily observable.
Citi is required to exercise subjective judgments relating to the applicability and functionality of internal valuation models, the significance of inputs or drivers to the valuation of an instrument and the degree of illiquidity and subsequent lack of observability in certain markets. The fair value of these instruments is reported on Citi’s Consolidated Balance Sheet with the changes in fair value recognized in either the Consolidated Statement of Income or in
AOCI
.
Losses on available-for-sale securities whose fair values are less than the amortized cost, where Citi intends to sell the security or could more-likely-than-not be required to sell the security prior to recovery, are recognized in earnings. Where Citi does not intend to sell the security nor could more-likely-than-not be required to sell the security, any portion of the loss that is attributable to credit is recognized as an allowance for credit losses with a corresponding provision for credit losses, and the remainder of the loss is recognized in
AOCI
. Such losses are capped at the difference between the fair value and amortized cost of the security.
For equity securities carried at cost or under the measurement alternative, decreases in fair value below the carrying value are recognized as impairment in the Consolidated Statement of Income. Moreover, for certain equity method investments, decreases in fair value are only recognized in earnings in the Consolidated Statement of Income if such decreases are judged to be an other-than-temporary impairment (OTTI). Assessing if the fair value impairment is temporary is also inherently judgmental.
The fair value of financial instruments incorporates the effects of Citi’s own credit risk and the market view of counterparty credit risk, the quantification of which is also complex and judgmental. For additional information on Citi’s fair value analysis, see Notes 6, 23 and 24 in this Form 10-Q and Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Citi’s 2024 Form 10-K.

(1)    Includes Legacy Franchises corporate loans activity related to Mexico SBMM and the Assets Finance Group (AFG) (AFG was previously reported in
Markets
; all periods have been reclassified to reflect this move into Legacy Franchises), as well as other Legacy Holdings Assets corporate loans.
(2)    As of March 31, 2025, in
USPB
, Branded Cards ACLL/EOP loans was 6.6% and Retail Services ACLL/EOP loans was 11.8%.
(3)    See footnote 4 in “U.S. Personal Banking” above for the description of a change in reporting.
(4)
All Other
(managed basis) excludes divestiture-related impacts (Reconciling Items) related to (i) Citi’s divestitures of its Asia Consumer businesses and (ii) the planned IPO of Mexico Consumer/SBMM (Banamex) within Legacy Franchises. The Reconciling Items are reflected in Citi’s Consolidated Statement of Income. See “
All Other
—Divestiture-Related Impacts (Reconciling Items)” above.
(5)    Includes the ACL on
Other assets
and
Held-to-maturity debt securities
. The ACL on
Other assets
includes ACL related to transfer risk associated with exposures outside the U.S., driven by safety and soundness considerations under U.S. banking law.
Citi’s reserves for expected credit losses on funded loans and for unfunded lending commitments, standby letters of credit and financial guarantees are reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheet in the
Allowance for credit losses on loans
(ACLL) and
Other liabilities
(for Allowance for credit losses on unfunded lending commitments (ACLUC)), respectively. In addition, Citi’s reserves for expected credit losses on other financial assets carried at amortized cost, including held-to-maturity securities, reverse repurchase agreements, securities borrowed, deposits with banks and other financial receivables are reflected in
Other assets
. These reserves, together with the ACLL and ACLUC, are referred to as the ACL. Changes in the ACL are reflected as
Provision for
credit losses
in the Consolidated Statement of Income for each reporting period. Citi’s ability to estimate expected credit losses over the reasonable and supportable (R&S) period is based on the ability to forecast economic activity over a R&S timeframe. The R&S forecast period is eight quarters.
The ACL is composed of quantitative and qualitative management adjustment components. The quantitative component uses three forward-looking macroeconomic forecast scenarios—base, upside and downside. The qualitative management adjustment component includes risks not fully captured in the quantitative component. Both the quantitative and qualitative components are further discussed below.
86
Quantitative Component
Citi estimates expected credit losses for its quantitative component using (i) its comprehensive internal data on loss and default history, (ii) internal credit risk ratings, (iii) external credit bureau and rating agencies information and (iv) R&S forecasts of macroeconomic conditions.
For its consumer and corporate portfolios, Citi’s expected credit losses are determined primarily by utilizing models that consider the borrowers’ probability of default (PD), loss given default (LGD) and exposure at default (EAD). The loss likelihood and severity models used for estimating expected credit losses are sensitive to changes in macroeconomic variables, including housing prices, unemployment rate and real GDP, and cover a wide range of geographic, industry, product and business segments.
In addition, Citi’s models determine expected credit losses based on portfolio characteristics, including loan delinquencies, changes in portfolio size, default frequency, risk ratings and loss recovery rates, as well as other credit trends.
Qualitative Component
The qualitative management adjustment component includes risks that are not fully captured in the quantitative component. These may include but are not limited to portfolio characteristics, idiosyncratic events, factors not within historical loss data or the economic forecast, uncertainty in the credit environment and other factors as required by banking supervisory guidance for the ACL. The primary examples of these are the following:
•
Transfer risk associated with exposures outside the U.S., driven by certain safety and soundness considerations under U.S. banking law
•
Potential impacts on vulnerable industries and regions due to emerging macroeconomic risks and uncertainties, including those related to a potential global recession, inflation, interest rates and commodity prices.
•
Risk associated with consumer payment behavior given the elevated inflationary and interest rate environment
As of the first quarter of 2025, Citi’s qualitative component of the ACL decreased quarter-over-quarter. The decrease was primarily driven by a reduction in qualitative reserves associated with consumer payment behavior related to the elevated inflationary and interest rate environments, which are now captured in the quantitative component, partially offset by a build for specific risks and uncertainties impacting vulnerable industries and regions, as well as an increase in transfer risk associated with exposures outside the U.S. for safety and soundness considerations under U.S. banking law.
Macroeconomic Variables
As further discussed below, Citi considers various global macroeconomic variables for the base, upside and downside probability-weighted macroeconomic scenario forecasts it uses to estimate the quantitative component of the ACL. Citi’s forecasts of the U.S. unemployment rate and U.S. real GDP
growth rate represent the key macroeconomic variables that most significantly affect its estimate of the ACL.
The tables below present Citi’s forecasted quarterly average U.S. unemployment rate and year-over-year U.S. real GDP growth rate used in determining the base macroeconomic forecast for Citi’s ACL at each quarterly reporting period from the first quarter of 2024 to the first quarter of 2025:
(1)    Represents the average unemployment rate for the rolling, forward-looking eight quarters in the forecast horizon.
(1)    The year-over-year growth rate is the percentage change in the real (inflation adjusted) GDP level.
Under the base macroeconomic forecast as of the first quarter of 2025, U.S. real GDP growth is expected to slow during 2025, while the unemployment rate is expected to increase in 2025 but begin to decline in 2026.
Scenario Weighting
Citi’s ACL is estimated using three probability-weighted macroeconomic scenarios—base, upside and downside. The macroeconomic scenario weights are estimated using a statistical model, which, among other factors, takes into consideration key macroeconomic drivers of the ACL, severity of the scenario and other sources of macroeconomic uncertainties and risks. Citi evaluates scenario weights on a quarterly basis.
Citi’s downside scenario incorporates more adverse macroeconomic assumptions than the base scenario. For example, compared to the base scenario, Citi’s downside scenario reflects a recession, including an elevated average U.S. unemployment rate of 6.7% over the eight-quarter R&S period, with a peak difference of 3.2% in the third quarter of 2026. To further illustrate the impact of the adverse macroeconomic assumptions in the downside scenario, the weighted-average U.S. unemployment rate that considers all three probability-weighted scenarios is 5.1%. The downside scenario also reflects a year-over-year U.S. real GDP contraction in 2025 of 0.8%, with a peak quarter-over-quarter difference to the base scenario of 1.2%.
87
Citi’s ACL is sensitive to the various macroeconomic scenarios that drive the quantitative component of expected credit losses, due to changes in the length and severity of forecasted economic variables or events in the respective scenarios. Citi’s downside scenario incorporates more adverse macroeconomic assumptions than the weighted scenario assumptions. To demonstrate this sensitivity, if Citi applied 100% weight to the downside scenario as of March 31, 2025 to reflect the most severe economic deterioration forecast in the macroeconomic scenarios, there would have been a hypothetical incremental increase in the ACL of approximately $5.3 billion related to lending exposures, except for loans individually evaluated for credit losses and other financial assets carried at amortized cost.
This analysis does not incorporate any impacts or changes to the qualitative component of the ACL. These factors could change the outcome of the sensitivity analysis based on historical experience and current conditions at the time of the assessment. Given the uncertainty inherent in macroeconomic forecasting, Citi continues to believe that its ACL estimate based on a three probability-weighted macroeconomic scenario approach combined with the qualitative component remains appropriate as of March 31, 2025.
1Q25 Changes in the ACL
As further discussed below, Citi’s ending ACL balance for the first quarter of 2025 was $22.8 billion, an increase of $0.6 billion from December 31, 2024. The net build of $0.2 billion in the quarter was driven by uncertainty and deterioration in the macroeconomic outlook and changes in portfolio composition in
USPB
, partially offset by lower end-of-period U.S. cards loan balances in
USPB
. Citi believes its analysis of the ACL reflects the forward view of the economic environment as of March 31, 2025. See Note 15 for additional information.
Consumer Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans
Citi’s consumer ACLL is primarily driven by U.S. cards (Branded Cards and Retail Services) in
USPB
. Citi’s total consumer ACLL net release was ($0.1) billion in the first quarter of 2025, primarily driven by lower cards balances, offset by changes in portfolio composition in
USPB
, and uncertainty and deterioration in the macroeconomic outlook in
USPB
,
Wealth
and
All Other
. This resulted in a March 31, 2025 ACLL balance of $16.0 billion, or 4.14% of total funded consumer loans.
For U.S. cards, the level of reserves relative to total funded loans increased to 8.23% at March 31, 2025, driven by changes in portfolio composition and uncertainty and deterioration in the macroeconomic outlook, compared to 7.93% at December 31, 2024. For the remaining consumer exposures, the level of reserves relative to total funded loans was 1.17% at March 31, 2025, compared to 1.11% at December 31, 2024.
Corporate Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans
Citi had a corporate ACLL build of $0.2 billion in the first quarter of 2025, largely driven by uncertainty and
deterioration in the macroeconomic outlook.
This resulted in a March 31, 2025 ACLL balance of $2.7 billion, or 0.89% of total funded corporate loans.
ACLUC
Citi had an ACLUC build of $0.1 billion in the first quarter of 2025, largely driven by uncertainty and deterioration in the macroeconomic outlook. The ACLUC reserve balance, included in
Other liabilities
,
was $1.7 billion at March 31, 2025.
ACL on Other Financial Assets
Citi had an ACL build of less than $0.1 billion on other financial assets carried at amortized cost for the first quarter of 2025, primarily driven by an increase in transfer risk associated with unremittable corporate dividends outside the U.S. being held on behalf of clients, driven by safety and soundness considerations under U.S. banking law. Including FX/Other, the ACL reserve balance of $2.3 billion increased $0.3 billion from December 31, 2024. See Note 15 for additional information.
See Notes 1 and 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Citi’s 2024 Form 10-K for further descriptions of the ACL and related accounts.
Goodwill
Citi tests for goodwill impairment annually as of October 1 (the annual test) and conducts interim assessments between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more-likely-than-not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. These events or circumstances include, among other things, a significant adverse change in the business climate, a decision to sell or dispose of all or a significant portion of a reporting unit or a sustained decrease in Citi’s stock price.
Citi performed its annual goodwill impairment test, which resulted in no impairment of any of Citi’s consolidated reporting units’ goodwill. No additional triggering events were identified and no goodwill was impaired during 2024. For each of the Company’s reporting units, fair value exceeded carrying value by at least 10%.
Reporting units used for goodwill assessment at the Citigroup consolidated level may differ from the reporting units of its subsidiaries.
Unanticipated declines in business performance, increases
in credit losses, increases in capital requirements and adverse regulatory or legislative changes, as well as deterioration in economic or market conditions, are factors that could result in a material impairment loss to earnings in a future period related to some portion of the associated goodwill. See Note 16 for additional information on goodwill, including the changes in the goodwill balance in the quarter and the
segments’ goodwill balances as of March 31, 2025.
88
Litigation Accruals
See the discussion in Note 27 for Citi’s policies on establishing accruals for litigation and regulatory contingencies.
INCOME TAXES
Effective Tax Rate
Citi’s effective tax rate was 25% in the first quarter of 2025 and in the first quarter of 2024, with the rates for all periods including the impact of divestitures.
Deferred Tax Assets
For additional information on Citi’s deferred tax assets (DTAs), see “Capital Resources,” “Risk Factors—Strategic Risks,” “Significant Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates—Income Taxes” and Notes 1 and 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Citi’s 2024 Form 10-K.
The table below summarizes Citi’s net DTAs balance:
At March 31, 2025, Citigroup had recorded net DTAs of approximately $29.6 billion, a decrease of $0.2 billion from December 31, 2024. The quarter-over-quarter decrease was primarily from a carry-forward reduction. Of Citi’s $29.6 billion of net DTAs, $13.8 billion (compared to $12.8 billion at December 31, 2024) was deducted in calculating Citi’s regulatory capital, and the remaining $15.8 billion was appropriately risk weighted under the Basel III rules.
The $13.8 billion of DTAs deducted from regulatory capital was composed of $11.5 billion related to tax carry-forwards, with $4.3 billion of temporary differences in excess of the 10%/15% regulatory limitations, reduced by $2.0 billion of deferred tax liabilities, primarily associated with goodwill and certain other intangible assets that were separately deducted from capital.
DTA Realizability
Citi believes that the net DTAs of $29.6 billion at March 31, 2025 are more-likely-than-not to be realized, based on management’s expectations of future taxable income generation in the jurisdictions in which the DTAs arise, as well as consideration of available tax planning strategies (as defined in ASC Topic 740,
Income Taxes
).
89
DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Citi’s disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, including without limitation that information required to be disclosed by Citi in its SEC filings is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO), as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Citi’s Disclosure Committee assists the CEO and CFO in their responsibilities to design, establish, maintain and evaluate the effectiveness of Citi’s disclosure controls and procedures. The Disclosure Committee is responsible for, among other things, the oversight, maintenance and implementation of the disclosure controls and procedures, subject to the supervision and oversight of the CEO and CFO.
Citi’s management, with the participation of its CEO and CFO, has evaluated the effectiveness of Citigroup’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) as of March 31, 2025. Based on that evaluation, the CEO and CFO have concluded that at that date Citigroup’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective.
DISCLOSURE PURSUANT TO SECTION 219 OF THE IRAN THREAT REDUCTION AND SYRIA HUMAN RIGHTS ACT
Pursuant to Section 219 of the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012 (Section 219), which added Section 13(r) to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, Citi is required to disclose in its annual or quarterly reports, as applicable, whether it or any of its affiliates knowingly engaged in certain activities, transactions or dealings relating to Iran or with certain individuals or entities that are the subject of sanctions under U.S. law. Disclosure may be required even where the activities, transactions or dealings were conducted in compliance with applicable law. To the extent that transactions or dealings for its clients are permitted by U.S. law, Citi may continue to engage in such activities.
During the first quarter of 2025, Citigroup identified one transaction that was reportable pursuant to Section 219.
On January 14, 2025, Citibank, N.A., New York Branch participated in a transaction that indirectly involved the Foreign Trade Bank of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) when it processed a funds transfer from an international organization to the account of the DPRK’s Permanent Mission at the international organization’s federal credit union. The total value of the payment was USD 1,000,000.00 and its purpose was to fund the international organization’s humanitarian activities in the DPRK and the operations of the DPRK mission. This transaction was made pursuant to a license issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control on November 23, 2024, which expires on November 30, 2025. Citi realized nominal fees for the processing of the payment.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
Certain statements in this Form 10-Q, including but not limited to statements included within Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, are “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. In addition, Citigroup may make forward-looking statements in its other documents filed or furnished with the SEC, and its management may make forward-looking statements orally to analysts, investors, representatives of the media and others.
Generally, forward-looking statements are not based on historical facts but instead represent Citigroup’s and its management’s beliefs regarding future events. Such statements may be identified by words such as believe, expect, anticipate, intend, estimate, may increase, may fluctuate, target, outlook, guidance and illustrative, and similar expressions or future or conditional verbs such as will, should, would and could.
Such statements are based on management’s current expectations and are subject to risks, uncertainties and changes in circumstances. Actual results of operations and financial conditions, including capital and liquidity, may differ materially from those included in these statements due to a variety of factors, including without limitation (i) the precautionary statements included within the “Executive Summary,” “Citi’s Multiyear Transformation” and each business’s discussion and analysis of its results of operations above and in Citi’s 2024 Form 10-K and Citi’s other SEC filings; (ii) the factors described under “Risk Factors” in Citi’s 2024 Form 10-K; and (iii) the risks and uncertainties summarized below:

•
Citi’s ability to achieve its objectives, including those related to revenue, net interest income, expense and capital expectations, from its priorities regarding its simplification, transformation and enhanced business performance, including the planned IPO of Mexico Consumer/SBMM (Banamex), which involve significant complexities, execution challenges and uncertainties, may not be as productive or effective as Citi expects or at all, may result in higher-than-expected expenses or lower expense savings or revenue growth than expected, litigation and regulatory scrutiny, CTA and other losses or other negative financial or strategic impacts, which could be material, and depend, in part, on factors that Citi cannot control or be able to mitigate, including, among others, macroeconomic challenges and uncertainties, customer, client and competitor actions, regulatory requirements or changes and heightened regulatory and supervisory expectations and scrutiny;
•
the potential impact to Citi from climate change due to both physical risks, including acute risks as well as the consequences of chronic changes in climate, and

•
Citi’s ability to compete effectively in the U.S. and globally with both financial and non-financial services firms, including as a result of certain competitors being subject to less stringent legal, regulatory and supervisory requirements; the introduction of mobile platforms and new or emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence (AI)–driven solutions; potential mergers and
acquisitions involving traditional financial services companies such as regional banks or credit card issuers; changes in the payments space; developments in digital finance, including changes driven by the U.S. administration; reliance on third parties for certain product and service offerings and any impact if a third party is unable to provide adequate support for such product and service offerings; and the increased operational, compliance and other risks resulting from the need to develop new or change or adapt existing products and services to attract and retain customers or clients or adapt to their changing policies or priorities to compete more effectively;

the potential impact of credit risk and concentrations of risk on Citi’s results of operations, including due to higher than expected defaults by or a significant downgrade in credit ratings of consumer, corporate or public sector borrowers or other counterparties in the U.S. or in various countries and jurisdictions globally, such as from indemnification obligations in connection with various transactions, including hedging or reinsurance arrangements related to those obligations, or Citi’s inability to liquidate or realize the fair value of its collateral, which risks can be heightened for vulnerable sectors, industries or countries impacted by macroeconomic, geopolitical, market and other challenges, uncertainties and volatilities;
•
the potential impact on Citi’s liquidity, sources of funding and costs of funding if it does not effectively manage its liquidity whether due to factors it cannot control or otherwise, including, among others, general disruptions in the financial markets; changes in fiscal and monetary policies; regulatory requirements, including changes in regulations; negative investor or counterparty perceptions of Citi’s creditworthiness; deposit outflows or unfavorable changes in deposit mix; unexpected increases in cash or collateral requirements; competition for funding, including for deposits and any decrease in demand for corporate debt securities; the consequent inability to monetize available liquidity resources; changes in Citi’s credit spreads; changes in interest rates; and changes in currency exchange rates;

ACCOUNTING CHANGES
Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures
In November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2023-07,
Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures
, intended to improve reportable segments disclosure requirements primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. The ASU includes a requirement to disclose significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker (CODM) and included within each reported measure of segment profit or loss, the title and position of the CODM, an explanation of how the CODM uses the reported measure(s) of segment profit or loss in assessing segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources, and all segments’ profit or loss and assets disclosures currently required annually by Topic 280 along with those introduced by the ASU to be reported on an interim basis. The amendments also clarified that public entities are not precluded from reporting additional measures of a segment’s profit or loss that are regularly used by the CODM.
Citi adopted the ASU on a retrospective basis for its annual period ending December 31, 2024 and the ASU for the interim period beginning January 1, 2025. See Note 3 for further details.
Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures
In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09,
Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures
, intended to enhance the transparency and decision usefulness of income tax disclosures. This guidance requires that public business entities disclose on an annual basis a tabular rate reconciliation in eight specific categories disaggregated by nature and for foreign tax effects by each jurisdiction that meets a 5% of pretax income multiplied by the applicable statutory tax rate or greater threshold annually. The eight categories include state and local income taxes, net of federal income tax effect; foreign tax effects; enactment of new tax laws; enactment of new tax credits; effect of cross-border tax laws; valuation allowances; nontaxable items and nondeductible items; and changes in unrecognized tax benefits. Additional disclosures include qualitative description of the state and local jurisdictions that contribute to the majority (greater than 50%) of the effect of the state and local income tax category and explanation of the nature and effect of changes in individual reconciling items. The guidance also requires entities annually to disclose income taxes paid (net of refunds received) disaggregated by federal, state and foreign taxes and by jurisdiction identified based on the same 5% quantitative threshold.
104
The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. The transition method is prospective with the retrospective method permitted. Citi plans to adopt the ASU for the year ending December 31, 2025.
See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Citi’s 2024 Form 10-K for a discussion of 2024 accounting changes.
FUTURE ACCOUNTING CHANGES
Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses
In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU No. 2024-03,
Income Statement—Reporting Comprehensive Income—Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40)
,
to improve the disclosures of expenses by requiring public business entities to provide further disaggregation of relevant expense captions (i.e., employee compensation, depreciation, intangible asset amortization) in a separate note to the financial statements, a qualitative description of the amounts remaining in relevant expense captions that are not separately disaggregated quantitatively, and the total amount of selling expenses and, in an annual reporting period, an entity’s definition of selling expenses.
The transition method is prospective with the retrospective method permitted, and the ASU will be effective for Citi for its annual period ending December 31, 2027 and interim periods for the interim period beginning January 1, 2028. Citi is currently evaluating the impact on its disclosures.

OPERATING SEGMENTS
The operating segments and reporting units reflect how the CEO, who is the chief operating decision maker (CODM), manages the Company, including allocating resources and measuring performance.
Citi is organized into
five
reportable operating segments:
Services
,
Markets
,
Banking
,
Wealth
and
U.S. Personal Banking (USPB)
, with the remaining operations recorded in
All Other
, which includes activities not assigned to a specific reportable operating segment, as well as discontinued operations. See operating segment details in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Citi’s 2024 Form 10-K.
Revenues and expenses directly associated with each respective business segment or component are included in determining respective operating results. Other revenues and expenses that are attributable to a particular business segment or component are generally allocated from
All Other
based on respective net revenues, non-interest expenses or other relevant measures.
Revenues and expenses from transactions with other operating segments or components are treated as transactions with external parties for purposes of segment disclosures, while funding charges paid by operating segments and funding credits received by Corporate Treasury within
All Other
are included in net interest income. The Company includes intersegment eliminations within
All Other
to reconcile the operating segment results to Citi’s consolidated results.
The accounting policies of these reportable operating segments are the same as those disclosed in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Citi’s 2024 Form 10-K.
107
The following tables present certain information regarding the Company’s continuing operations by reportable operating segments and
All Other
on a managed basis that excludes divestiture-related impacts. The CODM uses
Income (loss) from continuing operations
as the performance measure, to evaluate the results of each reportable operating segment by
comparing to and monitoring against budget and prior-year results. This information is used to allocate resources to each of the segments and to make operational decisions when managing the Company, such as whether to reinvest profits or to return capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.

Non-Marketable Equity Securities Not Carried at
Fair Value
Non-marketable equity securities are required to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in earnings unless (i) the measurement alternative is elected or (ii) the investment represents Federal Reserve Bank and Federal Home Loan Bank stock or certain exchange seats that continue to be carried at cost.
The election to measure a non-marketable equity security using the measurement alternative is made on an instrument-by-instrument basis. Under the measurement alternative, an equity security is carried at cost plus or minus changes resulting from observable prices in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer. The carrying value of the equity security is adjusted to fair value on the date of an observed transaction. Fair value may differ from the observed transaction price due to a number of factors, including marketability adjustments and differences in rights and obligations when the observed transaction is not for the identical investment held by Citi.
Equity securities under the measurement alternative, which are composed of private equity investments, are also assessed for impairment. On a quarterly basis, management qualitatively assesses whether each equity security under the measurement alternative is impaired. For details on impairment indicators that are considered, see Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Citi’s 2024 Form 10-K.
When the qualitative assessment indicates that the equity security is impaired, its fair value is determined. If the fair value of the investment is less than its carrying value, the investment is written down to fair value through earnings.
Below is the carrying value of non-marketable equity securities measured using the measurement alternative at March 31, 2025 and
December 31, 2024
:
Below are amounts recognized in earnings and life-to-date amounts for non-marketable equity securities measured using the measurement alternative:
(1)     See Note 23 for additional information on these nonrecurring fair value measurements.
A similar impairment analysis is performed for non-marketable equity securities carried at cost. For the three months ended March 31, 2025 and March 31, 2024, there was no impairment loss recognized in earnings for non-marketable equity securities carried at cost.

Consumer Loan Modifications to Borrowers Experiencing Financial Difficulty
Citi’s significant consumer modification programs are described below.
Credit Cards
Citi seeks to assist credit card borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulty by offering long-term loan modification programs. These modifications generally involve reducing the interest rate on the credit card, placing the customer on a fixed payment plan not to exceed 60 months and canceling the customer’s available line of credit. Citi also grants modifications to credit card borrowers working with third-party renegotiation agencies that seek to restructure customers’ entire unsecured debt. In certain situations, Citi may forgive a portion of an outstanding balance if the borrower pays a required amount.
Residential Mortgages
Citi utilizes a third-party subservicer for the servicing of its residential mortgage loans. Through this third-party subservicer, Citi seeks to assist residential mortgage borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulty primarily by offering interest rate reductions, principal and/or interest forbearance, term extensions or combinations thereof. Borrowers enrolled in forbearance programs typically have payments suspended until the end of the forbearance period. In the U.S., before permanently modifying the contractual payment terms of a mortgage loan, Citi enters into a trial modification with the borrower, generally a
three-month
period during which the borrower makes monthly payments under the anticipated modified payment terms. Upon successful completion of the trial period, and the borrower’s formal acceptance of the modified terms, Citi and the borrower enter into a permanent modification. Citi expects the majority of loans entering trial modifications to ultimately be enrolled in a permanent modification. During the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, $
14
million and $
11
million, respectively, of mortgage loans were enrolled in trial programs. Mortgage loans of $
3
million and $
2
million had gone through Chapter 7 bankruptcy during the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively.
142
Types of Consumer Loan Modifications and Their Financial Effect
The following tables provide details on permanent consumer loan modifications granted during the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024 to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty by type of modification granted and the financial effect of those modifications:
(1)    The above tables reflect activity for loans outstanding as of the end of the reporting period. During the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, Citi granted forgiveness of less than $
1
million and less than $
1
million in residential first mortgage loans, $
32
million and $
25
million in credit card loans and $
2
million and $
3
million in personal, small business and other loans, respectively. As a result, there were no outstanding balances as of March 31, 2025 and 2024.
(2)    Commitments to lend to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty that were granted modifications included in the tables above were immaterial at March 31, 2025 and 2024.
(3)    For major consumer portfolios, the ACLL is based on macroeconomic-sensitive models that rely on historical performance and macroeconomic scenarios to forecast expected credit losses. Modifications of consumer loans impact expected credit losses by affecting the likelihood of default.
(4)    North America includes the U.S., Canada and Puerto Rico. Mexico is included in offices outside North America.
(5)    Excludes residential first mortgages discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy in the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024.
143
Performance of Modified Consumer Loans
The following tables present the delinquencies and gross credit losses of permanently modified consumer loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty, including loans that were modified during the 12 months ended March 31, 2025 and the year ended December 31, 2024:
(1)    North America includes the U.S., Canada and Puerto Rico. Mexico is included in offices outside North America.
(2)    Typically, upon modification a loan re-ages to current. However, FFIEC guidelines for re-aging certain loans require that at least three consecutive minimum monthly payments, or the equivalent amount, be received. In these cases, the loan will remain delinquent until the payment criteria for re-aging have been satisfied.
144
Defaults of Modified Consumer Loans
The following tables present default activity for permanently modified consumer loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty by type of modification granted, including loans that were modified and subsequently defaulted during the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024. Default is defined as 60 days past due:
(1)    The above tables reflect activity for loans outstanding as of the end of the reporting period.
(2)    Modified residential first mortgages that default are typically liquidated through foreclosure or a similar type of liquidation.
(3)    North America includes the U.S., Canada and Puerto Rico. Mexico is included in offices outside North America.
(4)    Modified credit card loans that default continue to be charged off in accordance with Citi’s consumer charge-off policy.

ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES
(1)
Represents additional credit loss reserves for unfunded lending commitments and letters of credit recorded in
Other liabilities
on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
(2)
See additional details on the Allowance for credit losses on other assets below.
(3)
Primarily reflects the impact of FX translation on the ACL on
Other assets
for transfer risk associated with exposures outside the U.S., driven by safety and soundness considerations under U.S. banking law.
146
Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans (ACLL) and End-of-Period Loans
1Q25 Changes in the ACL
The total allowance for credit losses on loans, leases, unfunded lending commitments, other assets and HTM debt securities (in aggregate, total ACL) as of March 31, 2025 was $
22,782
million, an increase from $
22,177
million at December 31, 2024, primarily driven by uncertainty and deterioration in the macroeconomic outlook, portfolio composition in
USPB
and FX translation on the ACL on
Other assets
, partially offset by an ACL release for lower end-of-period U.S. cards loan balances.
Consumer ACLL
Citi’s total consumer allowance for credit losses on loans (ACLL) as of March 31, 2025 was $
16,001
million, a slight decrease from $
16,018
million at December 31, 2024. The decrease was driven by a reduction in U.S. cards loan balances, primarily offset by a build due to changes in portfolio composition, uncertainty and deterioration in the macroeconomic outlook.
Corporate ACLL
Citi’s total corporate ACLL as of March 31, 2025 was $
2,725
million, an increase from $
2,556
million at December 31, 2024. The increase was largely driven by uncertainty and deterioration in the macroeconomic outlook.
ACLUC
As of March 31, 2025, Citi’s total allowance for unfunded lending commitments (ACLUC), included in
Other liabilities
, was $
1,720
million, an increase from $
1,601
million at December 31, 2024. The increase was largely driven by uncertainty and deterioration in the macroeconomic outlook.
147
Allowance for Credit Losses on Other Assets
(1)
Primarily ACL related to transfer risk associated with exposures outside the U.S., driven by safety and soundness considerations under U.S. banking law.

GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS
Goodwill
The changes in
Goodwill
were as follows:
Citi tests for goodwill impairment annually as of October 1 (the annual test) and conducts interim assessments between the annual test if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more-likely-than-not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. No such events or circumstances were identified as part of the qualitative assessment performed as of March 31, 2025. For additional information regarding Citi’s goodwill impairment testing process, see Notes 1 and 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Citi’s 2024 Form 10-K.
Unanticipated declines in business performance, increases
in credit losses, increases in capital requirements and adverse regulatory or legislative changes, as well as deterioration in economic or market conditions, are factors that could result in a material impairment loss to earnings in a future period related to some portion of the associated goodwill.
Reporting units used for goodwill assessment at the Citigroup consolidated level may differ from the reporting units of its subsidiaries.
Intangible Assets
The components of intangible assets were as follows:
The changes in intangible assets were as follows:
(1)
Reflects intangibles for the value of purchased cardholder relationships, which are discrete from contract-related intangibles.
(2)
Reflects contract-related intangibles associated with Citi’s credit card program agreements with partners.

CHANGES IN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS) (AOCI)
Changes in each component of Citigroup’s
Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)
were as follows:
(1)
Reflects the after-tax valuation of Citi’s fair value option liabilities. See “Market Valuation Adjustments” in Note 23.
(2)
Primarily driven by Citi’s pay floating/receive fixed interest rate swap programs that hedge certain floating rates on assets.
(3)
Primarily reflects adjustments based on actuarial valuations of the Company’s significant pension and postretirement plans, actuarial valuations of all other plans and amortization of amounts previously recognized in other comprehensive income.

until the sale or substantial liquidation of the foreign entity, at which point such amounts related to the foreign entity are reclassified into earnings.
(5)
Reflects the change in the liability for future policyholder benefits for certain long-duration life-contingent annuity contracts that are issued by a regulated Citi insurance subsidiary in Mexico and reported within Legacy Franchises. The amount reflects the change in the liability after discounting using an upper-medium-grade fixed income instrument yield that reflects the duration characteristics of the liability. The balance of the liability for future policyholder benefits, which is recorded within
Other Liabilities
, for this insurance subsidiary was approximately $
425
million and $
546
million at March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively.
152

SECURITIZATIONS AND VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES
For additional information regarding Citi’s use of special purpose entities (SPEs) and variable interest entities (VIEs), see Note 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Citi’s 2024 Form 10-K.
Citigroup’s involvement with consolidated and unconsolidated VIEs with which the Company holds significant variable interests or has continuing involvement through servicing a majority of the assets in a VIE is presented below:
(1)    The definition of maximum exposure to loss is included in the text that follows this table.
(2)    Included on Citigroup’s March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024 Consolidated Balance Sheet.
(3)    A significant unconsolidated VIE is an entity in which the Company has any variable interest or continuing involvement considered to be significant, regardless of the likelihood of loss.
(4)    Citigroup mortgage securitizations also include agency and non-agency (private label) re-securitization activities. These SPEs are not consolidated. See “Re-securitizations” below for further discussion.
(5)     Included within this line are loans to third-party-sponsored private equity funds, which represent $
82.6
billion and $
45.5
billion in unconsolidated VIE assets and $
875
million and $
824
million in maximum exposure to loss as of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively.
157
The previous tables do not include:
•
certain investment funds for which the Company provides investment management services and personal estate trusts for which the Company provides administrative, trustee and/or investment management services;
•
certain third-party-sponsored private equity funds to which the Company provides credit facilities. The Company has no decision-making power and does not consolidate these funds, some of which may meet the definition of a VIE. The Company’s maximum exposure to loss is generally limited to a loan or lending-related commitment. As of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, the Company’s maximum exposure to loss related to these transactions was $
8.4
billion and $
8.1
billion, respectively (see Note 14 and Note 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Citi’s 2024 Form 10-K);
•
certain VIEs structured by third parties in which the Company holds securities in inventory, as these investments are made on arm’s-length terms;
•
certain positions in mortgage- and asset-backed securities held by the Company, which are classified as
Trading account assets
or
Investments
, in which the Company has no other involvement with the related securitization entity deemed to be significant (see Notes 13 and 23);
•
certain representations and warranties exposures in Citigroup residential mortgage securitizations, in which the original mortgage loan balances are no longer outstanding; and
•
VIEs such as preferred securities trusts used in connection with the Company’s funding activities. The Company does not have a variable interest in these trusts.
Consolidated VIEs
The Company engages in on-balance sheet securitizations, which are securitizations that do not qualify for sales treatment; thus, the assets remain on Citi’s Consolidated Balance Sheet, and any proceeds received are recognized as secured liabilities. In general, the third-party investors in the obligations of consolidated VIEs have legal recourse only to the assets of the respective VIEs and do not have such recourse to the Company, except where Citi has provided a guarantee to the investors or is the counterparty to certain derivative transactions involving the VIE. Thus, Citigroup’s maximum legal exposure to loss related to consolidated VIEs is significantly less than the carrying value of the consolidated VIE assets due to outstanding third-party financing.
Intercompany assets and liabilities are excluded from Citi’s Consolidated Balance Sheet. All VIE assets are restricted from being sold or pledged as collateral. The cash flows from these assets are the only source used to pay down the associated liabilities, which are non-recourse to Citi’s general assets.
The asset balances for consolidated VIEs represent the carrying amounts of the assets consolidated by the Company. The carrying amount may represent the amortized cost or the current fair value of the assets depending on the classification of the asset (e.g., loan or security) and the associated accounting model ascribed to that classification.
The asset balances for unconsolidated VIEs in which the Company has significant involvement represent the most current information available to the Company. In most cases, the asset balances represent an amortized cost basis without regard to impairments, unless fair value information is readily available to the Company.
The maximum funded exposure represents the balance sheet carrying amount of the Company’s investment in the VIE. It reflects the initial amount of cash invested in the VIE, adjusted for any accrued interest and cash principal payments received. The carrying amount may also be adjusted for increases or declines in fair value or any impairment in value recognized in earnings. The maximum exposure of unfunded positions represents the remaining undrawn committed amount, including liquidity and credit facilities provided by the Company or the notional amount of a derivative instrument considered to be a variable interest. In certain transactions, the Company has entered into derivative instruments or other arrangements that are not considered variable interests in the VIE (e.g., interest rate swaps, cross-currency swaps or where the Company is the purchaser of credit protection under a credit default swap or total return swap where the Company pays the total return on certain assets to the SPE). Receivables under such arrangements are not included in the maximum exposure amounts.
158
The following tables present certain assets and liabilities of consolidated VIEs, which are included on Citi’s Consolidated Balance Sheet. The assets include those assets that can only be used to settle obligations of consolidated VIEs and are in excess of those obligations. In addition, the assets include third-party assets of consolidated VIEs only and exclude intercompany balances that eliminate in consolidation. The liabilities include third-party liabilities of consolidated VIEs only and exclude intercompany balances that eliminate in consolidation. The liabilities also exclude amounts where creditors or beneficial interest holders have recourse to the general credit of Citigroup.
159
Funding Commitments for Significant Unconsolidated VIEs—Liquidity Facilities and Loan Commitments
The following table presents the notional amount of liquidity facilities and loan commitments that are classified as funding commitments in the VIE tables above:
Significant Interests in Unconsolidated VIEs—Balance Sheet Classification
The following table presents the carrying amounts and classification of significant variable interests in unconsolidated VIEs:
Credit Card Securitizations
The Company’s primary credit card securitization activity is through
two
trusts—Citibank Credit Card Master Trust and Citibank Omni Trust. These trusts are consolidated entities given Citi’s continuing involvement. For additional information, see Note 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Citi’s 2024 Form 10-K. There were no material cash flows arising from either proceeds from new securitizations or paydowns of maturing notes during the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024.
160
Mortgage Securitizations
The following tables summarize selected cash flow information and retained interests related to Citigroup mortgage securitizations:
Note: Excludes re-securitization transactions.
Gains recognized on the securitization of U.S. agency-sponsored mortgages were less than $
1
million for the three months ended March 31, 2025. Gains recognized on the securitization of non-agency-sponsored mortgages were $
60.8
million for the three months ended March 31, 2025.
Gains recognized on the securitization of U.S. agency-sponsored mortgages were less than $
1
million for the three months ended March 31, 2024. Gains recognized on the securitization of non-agency-sponsored mortgages were $
36.5
million for the three months ended March 31, 2024.
(1)    Disclosure of non-agency-sponsored mortgages as senior and subordinated interests is indicative of the interests’ position in the capital structure of the securitization.
(2)    Retained interests consist of Level 2 and Level 3 assets depending on the observability of significant inputs. See Note 23 for more information about fair value measurements.
The following table includes information about loan delinquencies and liquidation losses for assets held in non-consolidated, non-agency-sponsored securitization entities:
(1)    Securitized assets include $
0.1
billion of personal loan securitizations as of March 31, 2025.
161
Consumer Loan Securitizations
Beginning in the third quarter of 2023, Citi relaunched a program securitizing other consumer loans into asset-backed securities. The principal securitized and the proceeds from new securitizations for the three months ended March 31, 2025 were $
0.3
billion and $
0.2
billion, respectively. The gains recognized on the securitization of consumer loans were $
0.2
million for the three months ended March 31, 2025.
Mortgage Servicing Rights (MSRs)
In connection with the securitization of mortgage loans, Citi’s U.S. consumer mortgage business generally retains the servicing rights, which entitle the Company to a future stream of cash flows based on the outstanding principal balances of the loans and the contractual servicing fee. Failure to service the loans in accordance with contractual requirements may lead to a termination of the servicing rights and the loss of future servicing fees. These transactions create intangible assets referred to as MSRs, which are recorded at fair value on Citi’s Consolidated Balance Sheet (see Note 23 for the valuation of MSRs). The MSRs correspond to principal loan balances of $
57
billion and $
52
billion as of March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively.
The Company receives fees during the course of servicing previously securitized mortgages.
The amounts of these fees were as follows:
In the Consolidated Statement of Income these fees are primarily classified as
Commissions and fees
, and changes in MSR fair values are classified as
Other revenue
.
Re-securitizations
The Company engages in re-securitization transactions backed by either residential or commercial mortgages in which debt securities are transferred to a VIE in exchange for new beneficial interests. Citi did not transfer non-agency (private label) securities to re-securitization entities, nor did Citi hold retained interests in such securitizations, during the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024.
As of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, Citi held
no
retained interests in private label re-securitization transactions structured by Citi.
The Company also re-securitizes U.S. government-agency-guaranteed mortgage-backed (agency) securities. During the three months ended March 31, 2025, Citi transferred agency securities with a fair value of approximately $
7.0
billion to re-securitization entities, compared to approximately $
4.4
billion for the three months ended March 31, 2024.
As of March 31, 2025, the fair value of Citi-retained interests in agency re-securitization transactions structured by Citi totaled approximately $
2.5
billion (including $
1.3
billion related to re-securitization transactions executed in 2025), compared to $
1.6
billion as of December 31, 2024 (including $
977
million related to re-securitization transactions executed in 2024), which is recorded in
Trading account assets
. The original fair values of agency re-securitization transactions in which Citi holds a retained interest as of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024 were approximately $
77.6
billion and $
76.8
billion, respectively.
As of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, the Company did not consolidate any private label or agency re-securitization entities.
Citi-Administered Asset-Backed Commercial Paper Conduits
At March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, the commercial paper conduits administered by Citi had approximately $
18.3
billion and $
21.3
billion of purchased assets outstanding, and unfunded commitments with clients of approximately $
17.1
billion and $
16.7
billion, respectively.
At March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, the weighted-average remaining maturities of the commercial paper issued by the conduits were approximately
91
and
82
days, respectively.
The conduits have obtained letters of credit from the Company that equal at least
8
% to
10
% of the conduit’s assets with a minimum of $
200
million to $
350
million. The letters of credit provided by the Company to the conduits total approximately $
1.9
billion and $
2.1
billion as of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively. In the event that defaulted assets exceed the transaction-specific credit enhancement described above, any losses in each conduit are allocated first to the Company and then to the commercial paper investors.
At March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, the Company owned $
4.7
billion and $
6.4
billion, respectively, of the commercial paper issued by its administered conduits. The Company’s investments were not driven by market illiquidity and the Company is not obligated under any agreement to purchase the commercial paper issued by the conduits.
Municipal Securities Tender Option Bond (TOB) Trusts
The Company provides credit enhancement for certain non-customer trusts. At March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, $
0.7
billion and $
0.4
billion, respectively, of the municipal bonds owned by non-customer TOB trusts were subject to a credit guarantee provided by the Company.
The Company provides other liquidity agreements or letters of credit to customer-sponsored municipal investment funds, which are not variable interest entities, and municipality-related issuers that totaled $
0.5
billion and $
0.5
billion as of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively. These liquidity agreements and letters of credit are offset by reimbursement agreements with various term-out provisions.

Asset-Based Financing
The primary types of Citi’s asset-based financings, total assets of the unconsolidated VIEs with significant involvement and Citi’s maximum exposure to loss are presented below. For Citi to realize the maximum loss, the VIE (borrower) would have to default with no recovery from the assets held by the VIE.

DERIVATIVES
In the ordinary course of business, Citigroup enters into various types of derivative transactions. All derivatives are recorded in
Trading account assets/Trading account liabilities
on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. For additional information regarding Citi’s use of and accounting for derivatives, see Note 24 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Citi’s 2024 Form 10-K.
Information pertaining to Citigroup’s derivatives activities, based on notional amounts, is presented in the table below. Derivative notional amounts are reference amounts from which contractual payments are derived and do not represent a complete measure of Citi’s exposure to derivative transactions. Citi’s derivative exposure arises primarily from
market fluctuations (i.e., market risk), counterparty failure (i.e., credit risk) and/or periods of high volatility or financial stress (i.e., liquidity risk), as well as any market valuation adjustments that may be required on the transactions. Moreover, notional amounts presented below do not reflect the netting of offsetting trades. For example, if Citi enters into a receive-fixed interest rate swap with $100 million notional, and offsets this risk with an identical but opposite pay-fixed position with a different counterparty, $200 million in derivative notionals is reported, although these offsetting positions may result in de minimis overall market risk.
In addition, aggregate derivative notional amounts can fluctuate from period to period in the normal course of business based on Citi’s market share, levels of client activity and other factors.
Derivative Notionals
(1)
Credit derivatives are arrangements designed to allow one party (protection purchaser) to transfer the credit risk of a “reference asset” to another party (protection seller). These arrangements allow a protection seller to assume the credit risk associated with the reference asset without directly purchasing that asset. The Company enters into credit derivative positions for purposes such as risk management, yield enhancement, reduction of credit concentrations and diversification of overall risk, and as a market-maker to facilitate client transactions.
164
The following tables present the gross and net fair values of the Company’s derivative transactions and the related offsetting amounts as of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024. Gross positive fair values are offset against gross negative fair values by counterparty, pursuant to enforceable master netting agreements. Under ASC 815-10-45, payables and receivables in respect of cash collateral received from or paid to a given counterparty pursuant to a credit support annex are included in the offsetting amount if a legal opinion supporting the enforceability of netting and collateral rights has been obtained. GAAP does not permit similar offsetting for security collateral.
In addition, the following tables reflect rule changes adopted by clearing organizations that require or allow entities to treat certain derivative assets, liabilities and the related variation margin as settlement of the related derivative fair values for legal and accounting purposes, as opposed to presenting gross derivative assets and liabilities that are subject to collateral, whereby the counterparties would also record a related collateral payable or receivable. The tables also present amounts that are not permitted to be offset in the Company’s balance sheet presentation, such as security collateral or cash collateral posted at third-party custodians, but which would be eligible for offsetting to the extent that an event of default has occurred and a legal opinion supporting enforceability of the netting and collateral rights has been obtained.
165
Derivative Mark-to-Market (MTM) Receivables/Payables
(1)
The derivatives fair values are also presented in Note 23.
(2)
Over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives are derivatives executed and settled bilaterally with counterparties without the use of an organized exchange or central clearing house. Cleared derivatives include derivatives executed bilaterally with a counterparty in the OTC market, but then novated to a central clearing house, whereby the central clearing house becomes the counterparty to both of the original counterparties. Exchange-traded derivatives include derivatives executed directly on an organized exchange that provides pre-trade price transparency.
(3)
Represents the netting of balances with the same counterparty under enforceable netting agreements. Approximately $
200
billion, $
67
billion and $
38
billion of the netting against trading account asset/liability balances is attributable to each of the OTC, cleared and exchange-traded derivatives, respectively.
(4)
Represents the netting of cash collateral paid and received by counterparties under enforceable credit support agreements with appropriate legal opinion supporting enforceability of netting. Substantially all netting of cash collateral received and paid is against OTC derivative assets and liabilities, respectively.
(5)
The net receivables/payables include approximately $
9
billion of derivative asset and $
13
billion of derivative liability fair values not subject to enforceable master netting agreements, respectively.
166

Exchange-traded derivatives include derivatives executed directly on an organized exchange that provides pre-trade price transparency.
(3)
Represents the netting of balances with the same counterparty under enforceable netting agreements. Approximately $
264
billion, $
36
billion and $
35
billion of the netting against trading account asset/liability balances is attributable to each of the OTC, cleared and exchange-traded derivatives, respectively.
(4)
Represents the netting of cash collateral paid and received by counterparties under enforceable credit support agreements with appropriate legal opinion supporting enforceability of netting. Substantially all netting of cash collateral received and paid is against OTC derivative assets and liabilities, respectively.

The net receivables/payables include approximately $
13
billion of derivative asset and $
15
billion of derivative liability fair values not subject to enforceable master netting agreements, respectively.
167
For the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, amounts recognized in
Principal transactions
in the Consolidated Statement of Income include certain derivatives not designated in a qualifying hedging relationship. Citigroup presents this disclosure by business classification, showing derivative gains and losses related to its trading activities together with gains and losses related to non-derivative instruments within the same trading portfolios, as this represents how these portfolios are risk managed. See Note 6 for further information.
The amounts recognized in

(2)
The gain (loss) amounts for commodity hedges are included in
Principal transactions.
(3)
Amounts related to the forward points (i.e., the spot-forward difference) that are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and are generally reflected directly in earnings under the mark-to-market approach. Amounts related to cross-currency basis, which are recognized in
AOCI
, are not reflected in the table above. The amount of cross-currency basis included in
AOCI

and
Net interest income
in the Consolidated Statement of Income.
The net gain (loss) associated with cash flow hedges expected to be reclassified from
AOCI
within 12 months of March 31, 2025 is approximately $(
0.3
) billion. The maximum length of time over which forecasted cash flows are hedged is
13
years.
The after-tax impact of cash flow hedges on
AOCI
is presented in Note 19.
Net Investment Hedges

1,850
million under protection sold.
172
Credit Risk-Related Contingent Features in Derivatives
Certain derivative instruments contain provisions that require the Company to either post additional collateral or immediately settle any outstanding liability balances upon the occurrence of a specified event related to the credit risk of the Company. These events, which are defined by the existing derivative contracts, are primarily downgrades in the credit ratings of the Company and its affiliates.
The fair value (excluding CVA) of all derivative instruments with credit risk-related contingent features that were in a net liability position at March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024 was $
13
billion and $
15
billion, respectively. The Company posted $
11
billion and $
13
billion as collateral for this exposure in the normal course of business as of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively.
A downgrade could trigger additional collateral or cash settlement requirements for the Company and certain affiliates. In the event that Citigroup and Citibank were downgraded a single notch by all
three
major rating agencies as of March 31, 2025, the Company could be required to post an additional $
0.2
billion as either collateral or settlement of the derivative transactions. In addition, the Company could be required to segregate with third-party custodians collateral previously received from existing derivative counterparties in an amount of approximately $
9
million upon the single notch downgrade, resulting in aggregate cash obligations and collateral requirements of approximately $
0.2
billion.
Derivatives Accompanied by Financial Asset Transfers
For transfers of financial assets accounted for as a sale by the Company, and for which the Company has retained substantially all of the economic exposure to the transferred asset through a total return swap executed with the same counterparty in contemplation of the initial sale (and still outstanding), the asset amounts derecognized and the gross cash proceeds received as of the date of derecognition were $
6.0
billion and $
6.2
billion as of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively.
At March 31, 2025, the fair value of these previously derecognized assets was $
5.5
billion. The fair value of the total return swaps as of March 31, 2025 was $
106.1
million recorded as gross derivative assets and $
182.3
million recorded as gross derivative liabilities. At December 31, 2024, the fair value of these previously derecognized assets was $
5.8
billion, and the fair value of the total return swaps was $
179
million recorded as gross derivative assets and $
29
million recorded as gross derivative liabilities.
The balances for the total return swaps are on a gross basis, before the application of counterparty and cash collateral netting, and are included primarily as equity derivatives in the tabular disclosures in this Note.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT
For additional information regarding fair value measurement at Citi, see Note 26 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Citi’s 2024 Form 10-K.
Fair Value Hierarchy Principles
ASC 820-10 specifies a hierarchy of inputs based on whether the inputs are observable or unobservable. Observable inputs are developed using market data and reflect market participant assumptions, while unobservable inputs reflect the Company’s market assumptions. These two types of inputs have created the following fair value hierarchy:
•
Level 1: Quoted prices for
identical
instruments in active markets.
•
Level 2: Quoted prices for
similar
instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs and value drivers are
observable
in the market.
•
Level 3: Valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are
unobservable
.
As required under the fair value hierarchy, the Company considers relevant and observable market inputs in its valuations where possible.
The fair value hierarchy classification approach typically utilizes rules-based and data-driven criteria to determine whether an instrument is classified as Level 1, Level 2 or Level 3:
•
The determination of whether an instrument is quoted in an active market and therefore considered a Level 1 instrument is based on the frequency of observed transactions and the quality of independent market data available on the measurement date.
•
A Level 2 classification is assigned where there is observability of prices/market inputs to models, or where any unobservable inputs are not significant to the valuation. The determination of whether an input is considered observable is based on the availability of independent market data and its corroboration, for example through observed transactions in the market.
•
Otherwise, an instrument is classified as Level 3.
Market Valuation Adjustments
The table below summarizes the credit valuation adjustments (CVA) and funding valuation adjustments (FVA) applied to the fair value of derivative instruments (recorded in
Trading account assets
and
Trading account liabilities
on the Consolidated Balance Sheet) at March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024:
The table below summarizes pretax gains (losses) related to changes in CVA and FVA on derivative instruments, net of hedges (recorded in
Principal transactions revenue
in the Consolidated Statement of Income), and changes in debt valuation adjustments (DVA) on Citi’s own fair value option (FVO) liabilities (recorded in
Other comprehensive income
in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income) for the periods indicated:
(1)    See Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Citi’s 2024 Form 10-K.
175
Items Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis
The following tables present for each of the fair value hierarchy levels the Company’s assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis at March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024. The Company may hedge positions
that have been classified in the Level 3 category with other financial instruments (hedging instruments) that may be classified as Level 3, but also with financial instruments classified as Level 1 or Level 2. The effects of these hedges are presented gross in the following tables:
Fair Value Levels
Table continues on the next page.
176
(1)
Represents netting of (i) the amounts due under securities purchased under agreements to resell and the amounts owed under securities sold under agreements to repurchase and (ii) derivative exposures covered by a qualifying master netting agreement and cash collateral offsetting.
(2)
Amounts exclude $
29
million of investments measured at net asset value (NAV) in accordance with ASU 2015-07,
Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosures for Investments in Certain Entities That Calculate Net Asset Value per Share (or Its Equivalent).
(3)
Because the amount of the cash collateral paid/received has not been allocated to the Level 1, 2 and 3 subtotals, these percentages are calculated based on total assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis, excluding the cash collateral paid/received on derivatives.

179
Changes in Level 3 Fair Value Category
The following tables present the changes in the Level 3 fair value category for the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024. The gains and losses presented below include changes in the fair value related to both observable and unobservable inputs.
The Company often hedges positions with offsetting positions that are classified in a different level. For example,
the gains and losses for assets and liabilities in the Level 3 category presented in the tables below do not reflect the effect of offsetting losses and gains on hedging instruments that may be classified in the Level 1 or Level 2 categories. In addition, the Company hedges items classified in the Level 3 category with instruments also classified in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. The hedged items and related hedges are presented gross in the following tables:
Level 3 Fair Value Rollforward
Table continues on the next page.
180
(1)
Net realized/unrealized gains (losses) are presented as increase (decrease) to Level 3 assets, and as (increase) decrease to Level 3 liabilities. Changes in fair value of available-for-sale debt securities are recorded in
AOCI
, unless related to credit impairment, while gains and losses from sales are recorded in
Realized gains (losses) from sales of investments
in the Consolidated Statement of Income.
(2)
Unrealized gains (losses) on MSRs are recorded in
Other revenue
in the Consolidated Statement of Income.
(3)
Represents the amount of total gains or losses for the period, included in earnings (and
AOCI
for changes in fair value of available-for-sale debt securities and DVA on fair value option liabilities), attributable to the change in fair value relating to assets and liabilities classified as Level 3 that are still held at March 31, 2025.
(4)
Total Level 3 trading derivative assets and liabilities have been netted in these tables for presentation purposes only.

Level 3 Fair Value Transfers
There were no significant Level 3 transfers for the period from December 31, 2024 to March 31, 2025.
The following were the significant Level 3 transfers for the period from December 31, 2023 to March 31, 2024:
During the three months ended March 31, 2024, transfers of
Long-term debt
were $
1.4
billion from Level 2 to Level 3. Of the $
1.4
billion transfer, approximately $
0.9
billion related to interest rate option volatility inputs becoming unobservable and/or significant relative to their overall valuation, and $
0.4
billion related to equity and credit derivative inputs (in addition to other volatility inputs, e.g., interest rate volatility inputs) becoming unobservable and/or significant to their overall valuation. In other instances, market changes have resulted in some inputs becoming more observable, and some unobservable inputs becoming less significant to the overall valuation of the instruments (e.g., when an option becomes deep-in or deep-out of the money). This has primarily resulted in $
0.8
billion of certain structured long-term debt products being transferred from Level 3 to Level 2 during the three months ended March 31, 2024
.
184
Valuation Techniques and Inputs for Level 3 Fair Value Measurements
The following tables present the valuation techniques covering the majority of Level 3 inventory and the most significant unobservable inputs used in Level 3 fair value measurements.
Differences between these tables and amounts presented in the Level 3 Fair Value Rollforward tables represent individually immaterial items that have been measured using a variety of valuation techniques other than those listed.
185
186
(1)
The tables above include the fair values for the items listed and may not represent the total population for each category.
(2)
Some inputs are shown as zero due to rounding.
(3)
When the low and high inputs are the same, there is either a constant input applied to all positions, or the methodology involving the input applies to only one large position.
(4)
Weighted averages are calculated based on the fair values of the instruments.
(5)
For equity securities, the price inputs are expressed on an absolute basis, not as a percentage of the notional amount.
(6)
Both trading and non-trading account derivatives—assets and liabilities—are presented on a gross absolute value basis.
(7)
Includes hybrid products.
187
Items Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis
Certain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis and, therefore, are not included in the tables above. These include assets measured at cost that have been written down to fair value during the periods as a result of an impairment. These also include non-marketable equity securities that have been measured using the measurement alternative and are either (i) written down to fair value during the periods as a result of an impairment or (ii) adjusted upward or downward to fair value as a result of a transaction observed during the periods for an identical or similar investment in the same issuer. In addition, these assets include loans held-for-sale and other real estate owned that are measured at the lower of cost or market value.
The following tables present the carrying amounts of all assets that were still held for which a nonrecurring fair value measurement was recorded:
(1)
Net of mark-to-market amounts on the unfunded portion of loans HFS recognized as
Other liabilities
on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
(2)
Represents collateral-dependent loans held for investment for which the fair value of collateral is used to estimate expected credit losses, and whose carrying amount is based on the fair value of the underlying collateral less costs to sell, as applicable (primarily real estate).
188
Valuation Techniques and Inputs for Level 3 Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements
The following tables present the valuation techniques covering the majority of Level 3 nonrecurring fair value measurements and the most significant unobservable inputs used in those measurements:

Estimated Fair Value of Financial Instruments Not Carried at Fair Value
The following tables present the carrying value and fair value of Citigroup’s financial instruments that are not carried at fair value. The tables below therefore exclude items measured at fair value on a recurring basis presented in the tables above.
(1)
Includes $
5.2
billion and $
5.2
billion of non-marketable equity securities carried at cost at March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively.
(2)
The carrying value of loans is net of the allowance for credit losses on loans of $
18.7
billion for March 31, 2025 and $
18.6
billion for December 31, 2024. In addition, the carrying values exclude $
0.3
billion and $
0.3
billion of lease finance receivables at March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively.
(3)
Includes items measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis.
(4)
Includes cash and due from banks, deposits with banks, brokerage receivables, reinsurance recoverables and other financial instruments included in
Other assets
on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, for all of which the carrying value is a reasonable estimate of fair value.
(5)
The carrying value includes long-term debt balances under qualifying fair value hedges.
(6)
Includes brokerage payables, separate and variable accounts, short-term borrowings (carried at cost) and other financial instruments included in
Other liabilities
on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, for all of which the carrying value is a reasonable estimate of fair value.
The estimated fair values of the Company’s corporate unfunded lending commitments at March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024 were off-balance sheet liabilities of $
10.9
billion and $
13.5
billion, respectively, substantially all of which are classified as Level 3. The Company does not estimate the fair values of consumer unfunded lending commitments, which are generally cancelable by providing notice to the borrower.

FAIR VALUE ELECTIONS
The Company may elect to report most financial instruments and certain other items at fair value on an instrument-by-instrument basis with changes in fair value reported in earnings, other than DVA (see below). The election is made upon the initial recognition of an eligible financial asset, financial liability or firm commitment or when certain specified reconsideration events occur. The fair value election
may not otherwise be revoked once an election is made. The changes in fair value are recorded in current earnings. Movements in DVA are reported as a component of
AOCI
.
The Company has elected fair value accounting for its mortgage servicing rights (MSRs). See Note 21 for additional details on Citi’s MSRs.
Additional discussion regarding other applicable areas in which fair value elections were made is presented in Note 23.
The following table presents the changes in fair value of those items for which the fair value option has been elected:
(1)
Includes gains (losses) associated with interest rate lock commitments for originated loans for which the Company has elected the fair value option.
(2)
Includes DVA that is included in
AOCI
. See Notes 19 and 23.
191
Own Debt Valuation Adjustments (DVA)
Own debt valuation adjustments are recognized on Citi’s liabilities for which the fair value option has been elected using Citi’s credit spreads observed in the bond market. Changes in fair value of fair value option liabilities related to changes in Citigroup’s own credit spreads (DVA) are reflected as a component of
AOCI
. See Note 19 for additional information.
Among other variables, the fair value of liabilities for which the fair value option has been elected (other than non-recourse debt and similar liabilities) is impacted by the narrowing or widening of the Company’s credit spreads.
The estimated changes in the fair value of these non-derivative liabilities due to such changes in the Company’s own credit spread (or instrument-specific credit risk) were a gain of $
1,000
million and a loss of $(
750
) million for the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively. Changes in fair value resulting from changes in instrument-specific credit risk were estimated by incorporating the Company’s current credit spreads observable in the bond market into the relevant valuation technique used to value each liability as described above.
The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities
Selected Portfolios of Securities Purchased Under Agreements to Resell, Securities Borrowed, Securities Sold Under Agreements to Repurchase, Securities Loaned and Certain Uncollateralized Short-Term Borrowings
The Company elected the fair value option for certain portfolios of fixed income securities purchased under agreements to resell and fixed income securities sold under
agreements to repurchase, securities borrowed, securities loaned and certain uncollateralized short-term borrowings held primarily by broker-dealer entities in the U.S., the U.K. and Japan. In each case, the election was made because the related interest rate risk is managed on a portfolio basis, primarily with offsetting derivative instruments that are accounted for at fair value through earnings.
Changes in fair value for transactions in these portfolios are recorded in
Principal transactions
. The related interest income and interest expense are measured based on the contractual rates specified in the transactions and are reported as
Interest income
and
Interest expense
in the Consolidated Statement of Income.
Loans and Other Credit Products
Citigroup has also elected the fair value option for certain other originated and purchased loans, including certain unfunded loan products, such as guarantees and letters of credit, executed by Citigroup’s lending and trading businesses. Significant groups of transactions include loans and unfunded loan products that are expected to be either sold or securitized in the near term, or transactions where the economic risks are hedged with derivative instruments, such as purchased credit default swaps or total return swaps where the Company pays the total return on the underlying loans to a third party. Citigroup has elected the fair value option to mitigate accounting mismatches in cases where hedge accounting is complex and to achieve operational simplifications. Fair value was not elected for most lending transactions across the Company.
The following table provides information about certain credit products carried at fair value:
In addition to the amounts reported above, $
207
million and $
280
million of unfunded commitments related to certain credit products selected for fair value accounting were outstanding as of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively.
192
Changes in the fair value of funded and unfunded credit products are classified in
Principal transactions
in Citi’s Consolidated Statement of Income. Related interest income is measured based on the contractual interest rates and reported as
Interest income
on
Trading account assets
or loan interest depending on the balance sheet classifications of the credit products. The changes in fair value for the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024 due to instrument-specific credit risk were a gain of $
24
million and a loss of $(
16
) million, respectively. Changes in fair value due to instrument-specific credit risk are estimated based on changes in borrower-specific credit spreads and recovery assumptions.
Certain Investments in Unallocated Precious Metals
Citigroup invests in unallocated precious metals accounts (e.g., gold, silver, platinum and palladium) as part of its commodity trading activities. Under ASC 815, the investment is bifurcated into a debt host contract and a commodity derivative instrument. Citigroup elects the fair value option for the debt host contract and reports the contract within
Trading account assets
on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet.
As part of its commodity trading activities, Citi trades unallocated precious metals investments and executes forward purchase and forward sale derivative contracts with trading counterparties. When Citi sells an unallocated precious metals investment, Citi’s receivable from its depository bank is repaid and Citi derecognizes its investment in the unallocated precious metal. The forward purchase or sale contract with the trading counterparty indexed to unallocated precious metals is accounted for as a derivative, at fair value through earnings.
Certain Mortgage Loans Held-for-Sale (HFS)
Citigroup has elected the fair value option for certain purchased and originated prime fixed-rate and conforming adjustable-rate first mortgage loans HFS. These loans are intended for sale or securitization and are economically hedged with derivative instruments. The Company has elected the fair value option to mitigate accounting mismatches in cases where hedge accounting is complex and to achieve operational simplifications.
The following table provides information about certain mortgage loans HFS carried at fair value:
The changes in the fair values of these mortgage loans are reported in
Other revenue
in the Company’s Consolidated Statement of Income. There was no net change in fair value during the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024 due to instrument-specific credit risk. Changes in fair value due to instrument-specific credit risk are estimated based on changes in the borrower default, prepayment and recovery forecasts in addition to instrument-specific credit spread. Related interest income continues to be measured based on the contractual interest rates and reported as
Interest income
in the Consolidated Statement of Income.
193
Certain Debt Liabilities
The Company has elected the fair value option for certain debt liabilities, because these exposures are considered to be trading-related positions and, therefore, are managed on a fair value basis. These positions are classified as
Long-term debt
or
Short-term borrowings
on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet.
The following table provides information about the carrying value of notes carried at fair value, disaggregated by type of risk:
The portion of the changes in fair value attributable to changes in Citigroup’s own credit spreads (DVA) is reflected as a component of
AOCI
while all other changes in fair value are reported in
Principal transactions
. Changes in the fair value of these liabilities include accrued interest, which is also included in the change in fair value reported in
Principal transactions
.
The following table provides information about long-term debt and short-term borrowings carried at fair value:

GUARANTEES AND COMMITMENTS
The following tables present information about Citi’s guarantees at March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024.
For additional information on Citi’s guarantees and indemnifications included in the tables below, as well as its other guarantees and indemnifications excluded from these tables, see Note 28 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Citi’s 2024 Form 10-K.
(1)
The carrying values of securities lending indemnifications were not material for either period presented, as the probability of potential liabilities arising from these guarantees is minimal.
(2)
At March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, this maximum potential exposure was estimated to be approximately $
80
billion and $
124
billion, respectively. However, Citi believes that the maximum exposure is not representative of the actual potential loss exposure based on its historical experience. This contingent liability is unlikely to arise, as most products and services are delivered when purchased and amounts are refunded when items are returned to merchants. As such, any losses incurred and the carrying amounts of Citi’s contingent obligations related to merchant processing activities were immaterial. See “Card Merchant Processing” below.
(3)
Includes additional guarantees entered into as part of the extension and amendment of the American Airlines co-branded credit card partnership agreement, executed in December 2024. See “Credit Card Arrangements with Partners” in Note 28 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Citi’s 2024 Form 10-K. Citi believes that the maximum exposure is not representative of actual potential loss exposure based on historical and expected future performance of the portfolio.
(4)
Includes guarantees of subsidiaries.
(5)
In the fourth quarter of 2024, the Company entered into an agreement that indemnifies certain subsidiaries of the Company against certain matters related to the business operated by the Company through other subsidiaries, including certain existing, as well as potential future, legal proceedings, including tax matters. Certain of such indemnification obligations have no stated expiration date and are not subject to specific limitations on the maximum potential amount of future payments that the Company could be required to make. The Company is not able to estimate the maximum potential amount of future payments to be made under this agreement because the triggering events are not predictable.
195
Loans Sold with Recourse
In addition to the amounts presented in the tables above, the repurchase reserve was approximately $
13
million and $
12
million at March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively, and these amounts are included in
Other liabilities
on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
Futures and Over-the-Counter Derivatives Clearing
Citi provides clearing services on central clearing parties (CCP) for clients that need to clear exchange-traded and over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives contracts with CCPs. As a clearing member, Citi is exposed to the risk of non-performance by clients (e.g., failure of a client to post variation margin to the CCP for negative changes in the value of the client’s derivative contracts). In the event of non-performance by a client, Citi would move to close out the client’s positions. The CCP would typically utilize initial margin posted by the client and held by the CCP, with any remaining shortfalls required to be paid by Citi as clearing member. Citi generally holds incremental cash or securities margin posted by the client, which would typically be expected to be sufficient to mitigate Citi’s credit risk in the event that the client fails to perform.
Carrying Value—Guarantees and Indemnifications
At March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, the total carrying amounts of the liabilities related to the guarantees and indemnifications included in the tables above amounted to approximately $
1.0
billion and $
1.0
billion, respectively. The carrying value of financial and performance guarantees is included in
Other liabilities
.
Collateral
Cash collateral available to Citi to reimburse losses realized under these guarantees and indemnifications amounted to $
53.1
billion and $
49.0
billion at March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively. Securities and other marketable assets held as collateral amounted to $
77.5
billion and $
62.5
billion at March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively. The majority of collateral is held to reimburse losses realized under securities lending indemnifications. In addition, letters of credit in favor of Citi held as collateral amounted to $
2.8
billion and $
3.1
billion at March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively. Other property may also be available to Citi to cover losses under certain guarantees and indemnifications; however, the value of such property has not been determined.
Performance Risk
Presented in the tables below are the maximum potential amounts of future payments that are classified based on internal and external credit ratings. The determination of the maximum potential future payments is based on the notional amount of the guarantees without consideration of possible recoveries under recourse provisions or from collateral held or pledged. As such, Citi believes such amounts bear no relationship to the anticipated losses, if any, on these guarantees.
196
Credit Commitments and Lines of Credit
The table below summarizes Citigroup’s credit commitments:
(1)
Consumer commitments related to the business HFS countries under sales agreements are reflected in their original categories until the respective sales are completed.
(2)
Other commitments and contingencies include commitments to purchase certain debt and equity securities.
The majority of unused commitments are contingent upon customers maintaining specific credit standards. Commercial commitments generally have floating interest rates and fixed expiration dates and may require payment of fees. Such fees (net of certain direct costs) are deferred and, upon exercise of the commitment, amortized over the life of the loan or, if exercise is deemed remote, amortized over the commitment period.
Other Commitments
As a Federal Reserve member bank, Citi is required to subscribe to half of a certain amount of shares issued by its Federal Reserve District Bank. As of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, Citi holds shares with a carrying value of $
4.5
billion, with the remaining half subject to call by the Federal Reserve District Bank Board.
In the normal course of business, Citi enters into reverse repurchase and securities borrowing agreements, as well as repurchase and securities lending agreements, which settle at a future date. At March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, Citi had approximately $
177.1
billion and $
117.7
billion of unsettled reverse repurchase and securities borrowing agreements, and approximately $
174.5
billion and $
126.8
billion of unsettled repurchase and securities lending agreements, respectively. See Note 11 for a further discussion of securities purchased under agreements to resell and securities borrowed, and securities sold under agreements to repurchase and securities loaned, including the Company’s policy for offsetting repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements.
These amounts are not included in the table above.
Restricted Cash
Citigroup defines restricted cash (as cash subject to withdrawal restrictions) to include cash deposited with central banks that must be maintained to meet minimum regulatory requirements, and cash set aside for the benefit of customers or for other purposes such as compensating balance arrangements or debt retirement. Restricted cash may include minimum reserve requirements at certain central banks and cash segregated to satisfy rules regarding the protection of customer assets as required by Citigroup broker-dealers’ primary regulators, including the SEC, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the United Kingdom’s Prudential Regulation Authority.
Restricted cash is included on the Consolidated Balance Sheet within the following balance sheet lines:
In addition to the restricted cash amounts presented above, at March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, approximately $
9.0
billion and $
7.2
billion, respectively, was held at the Russian Deposit Insurance Agency (DIA) and was subject to restrictions imposed by the Russian government. These restricted amounts are reported within
Other assets
on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
197
26.
LEASES
The Company’s operating leases, where Citi is a lessee, include real estate, such as office space and branches, and various types of equipment. These leases may contain renewal and extension options and early termination features; however, these options do not impact the lease term unless the Company is reasonably certain that it will exercise options. These leases have a weighted-average remaining lease term of approximately
six years
as of March 31, 2025.
For additional information regarding Citi’s leases, see Notes 1 and 29 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Citi’s 2024 Form 10-K.
The following table presents information on the right-of-use (ROU) asset and lease liabilities included in
Premises and equipment
and
Other liabilities
, respectively:
The Company recognizes fixed lease costs on a straight-line basis throughout the lease term in the Consolidated Statement of Income. In addition, variable lease costs are recognized in the period in which the obligation for those payments is incurred.
At March 31, 2025, the Company had a future lease commitment scheduled to commence in April 2025 with fixed lease payments (undiscounted) totaling approximately $
255
million over a
15-year
lease term.

CONTINGENCIES
The following information supplements and amends, as applicable, the disclosure in Note 30 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Citi’s 2024 Form 10-K. For purposes of this Note, Citigroup, its affiliates and subsidiaries and current and former officers, directors, and employees, are sometimes collectively referred to as Citigroup and Related Parties.
In accordance with ASC 450, Citigroup establishes accruals for contingencies, including any litigation, regulatory, or tax matters disclosed herein, when Citigroup believes it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Once established, accruals are adjusted from time to time, as appropriate, in light of additional information. The amount of loss ultimately incurred in relation to those matters may be substantially higher or lower than the amounts accrued for those matters. With respect to previously incurred loss contingencies for which recovery is expected, Citi applies loss recovery accounting when disputes and uncertainties affecting recognition are resolved.
If Citigroup has not accrued for a matter because the matter does not meet the criteria for accrual (as set forth above), or Citigroup believes an exposure to loss exists in excess of the amount accrued for a particular matter, in each case assuming a material loss is reasonably possible but not probable, Citigroup discloses the matter. In addition, for such matters, Citigroup discloses an estimate of the aggregate reasonably possible loss or range of loss in excess of the amounts accrued for those matters for which an estimate can be made. At March 31, 2025, Citigroup estimates that the reasonably possible unaccrued loss for these matters ranges up to approximately $
1.3
billion in the aggregate.
As available information changes, the matters for which Citigroup is able to estimate will change, and the estimates themselves will change. In addition, while many estimates presented in financial statements and other financial disclosures involve significant judgment and may be subject to significant uncertainty, estimates of the range of reasonably possible loss arising from litigation, regulatory, tax, or other matters are subject to particular uncertainties. For example, at the time of making an estimate, Citigroup may only have preliminary or incomplete information about the facts underlying the claim; its assumptions about the future rulings of the court or other tribunal on significant issues, or the behavior and incentives of adverse parties, regulators, or tax authorities may prove to be wrong; and the outcomes it is attempting to predict are often not amenable to the use of statistical or other quantitative analytical tools. In addition, from time to time an outcome may occur that Citigroup had not accounted for in its estimates because it had deemed such an outcome to be remote. For all these reasons, the amount of loss in excess of amounts accrued in relation to matters for which an estimate has been made could be substantially higher or lower than the range of loss included in the estimate.
Subject to the foregoing, it is the opinion of Citigroup’s management, based on current knowledge and after taking into account its current accruals, that the eventual outcome of all matters described in this Note would not be likely to have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial condition of Citigroup. Nonetheless, given the substantial or indeterminate amounts sought in certain of these matters and the inherent unpredictability of such matters, an adverse outcome in certain of these matters could, from time to time, have a material adverse effect on Citigroup’s consolidated results of operations or cash flows in particular quarterly or annual periods.
For further information on ASC 450 and Citigroup’s accounting and disclosure framework for contingencies, including for any litigation, regulatory, and tax matters disclosed herein, see Note 30 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Citi’s 2024 Form 10-K.

SUBSIDIARY GUARANTEES
Citigroup Inc. has fully and unconditionally guaranteed the payments due on debt securities issued by Citigroup Global Markets Holdings Inc. (CGMHI), a wholly owned subsidiary, under the Senior Debt Indenture dated as of March 8, 2016, between CGMHI, Citigroup Inc. and The Bank of New York Mellon, as trustee. In addition, Citigroup Capital III and Citigroup Capital XIII (collectively, the Capital Trusts), each of which is a wholly owned finance subsidiary of Citigroup Inc., have issued trust preferred securities. Citigroup Inc. has guaranteed the payments due on the trust preferred securities
to the extent that the Capital Trusts have insufficient available funds to make payments on the trust preferred securities. The guarantee, together with Citigroup Inc.’s other obligations with respect to the trust preferred securities, effectively provides a full and unconditional guarantee of amounts due on the trust preferred securities (see Note 18). No other subsidiary of Citigroup Inc. guarantees the debt securities issued by CGMHI or the trust preferred securities issued by the Capital Trusts.
Summarized financial information for Citigroup Inc. and CGMHI is presented in the tables below:

Equity Security Repurchases
All large banks, including Citi, are subject to limitations on capital distributions in the event of a breach of any regulatory capital buffers, including the Stress Capital Buffer, with the degree of such restrictions based on the extent to which the buffers are breached. For additional information, see “Capital Resources—Regulatory Capital Buffers” and “Risk Factors—Strategic Risks,” “—Operational Risks” and “—Compliance Risks” in Citi’s 2024 Form 10-K.
The following table summarizes Citi’s common share repurchases for the first quarter of 2025:
(1)    Represents repurchases under the multiyear $20 billion common stock repurchase program that was approved by Citigroup’s Board of Directors (the Board) on January 13, 2025 and announced on January 15, 2025. Repurchases by Citigroup under this common stock repurchase program are subject to quarterly approval by Citigroup’s Board; may be effected from time to time through open market purchases, trading plans established in accordance with SEC rules or other means; and, as determined by Citigroup, may be subject to satisfactory market conditions, Citigroup’s capital position and capital requirements, applicable legal requirements and other factors.
(2)    During the first quarter, pursuant to the Board’s authorization, Citi withheld an insignificant number of shares of common stock, added to treasury stock, related to activity on employee stock programs to satisfy the employee tax requirements.
During the first quarter of 2025, Citi repurchased $1.75 billion of common shares under the $20 billion stock repurchase program. For the second quarter of 2025, Citi is targeting a similar level of common share repurchases as the first quarter of 2025, subject to market conditions and other factors.
Dividends
Citi paid common dividends of $0.56 per share for the first quarter of 2025, and on April 3, 2025, declared common dividends of $0.56 per share for the second quarter of 2025.
Citi’s ability to pay common stock dividends is subject to limitations on capital distributions in the event of a breach of any regulatory capital buffers, including the Stress Capital Buffer, with the degree of such restrictions based on the extent to which the buffers are breached. For additional information,
see “Capital Resources—Regulatory Capital Buffers” and “Risk Factors—Strategic Risks,” “—Operational Risks” and “—Compliance Risks” in Citi’s 2024 Form 10-K.
Any dividend on Citi’s outstanding common stock would also need to be in compliance with Citi’s obligations on its outstanding preferred stock.
On April 3, 2025, Citi declared preferred dividends of approximately $287 million for the second quarter of 2025.
