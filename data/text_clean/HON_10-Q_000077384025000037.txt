CAUTIONARY STATEMENT ABOUT FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
We describe many of the trends and other factors that drive our business and future results in the section titled
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
and in other parts of this report (including
Part II, Item 1A Risk Factors
). Such discussions contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), including statements related to the proposed spin-off of the Company's Advanced Materials business into Solstice Advanced Materials, a standalone, publicly traded company, the proposed separation of Automation and Aerospace Technologies, the sale of the personal protective equipment business, and the acquisition of Sundyne. Forward-looking statements are those that address activities, events, or developments that we or our management intend, expect, project, believe, or anticipate will or may occur in the future. They are based on management’s assumptions and assessments in light of past experience and trends, current economic and industry conditions, expected future developments, and other relevant factors, many of which are difficult to predict and outside of our control, including Honeywell's current expectations, estimates, and projections regarding, among other things, the proposed spin-off of the Company's Advanced Materials business into Solstice Advanced Materials, a standalone, publicly traded company, the proposed separation of Automation and Aerospace Technologies, the sale of the personal protective equipment business, and the acquisition of Sundyne. They are not guarantees of future performance, and actual results, developments, and business decisions may differ significantly from those envisaged by our forward-looking statements, including the consummation of the spin-off of the Advanced Materials business into Solstice Advanced Materials, the proposed separation of Automation and Aerospace Technologies, the sale of our personal protective equipment business, and the acquisition of Sundyne, and the anticipated benefits of each. We do not undertake to update or revise any of our forward-looking statements, except as required by applicable securities law. Our forward-looking statements are also subject to material risks and uncertainties, including ongoing macroeconomic and geopolitical risks, such as the impacts of tariffs and other trade barriers and restrictions, lower GDP growth or recession in the U.S. or globally, supply chain disruptions, capital markets volatility, inflation, and certain regional conflicts, which can affect our performance in both the near and long term. In addition, no assurance can be given that any plan, initiative, projection, goal, commitment, expectation, or prospect set forth in this Form 10-Q can or will be achieved. These forward-looking statements should be considered in light of the information included in this report and our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), including, without limitation, the
Risk Factors
, as well as the description of trends and other factors in
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
, set forth in this report and our 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Any forward-looking plans described herein are not final and may be modified or abandoned at any time.

Honeywell reports its quarterly financial information using a calendar convention; the first, second, and third quarters are consistently reported as ending on March 31, June 30, and September 30, respectively. It is Honeywell's practice to establish actual quarterly closing dates using a predetermined fiscal calendar, which requires Honeywell's businesses to close their books on a Saturday in order to minimize the potentially disruptive effects of quarterly closing on the Company's business processes. The effects of this practice are generally not significant to reported results for any quarter and only exist within a reporting year. In the event differences in actual closing dates are material to year-over-year comparisons of quarterly or year-to-date results, Honeywell will provide appropriate disclosures. Honeywell's actual closing dates for the three months ended March 31, 2025, and 2024, were March 29, 2025, and March 30, 2024, respectively.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The accounting policies of the Company are set forth in Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the Company’s 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K. The Company includes herein certain updates to those policies.
RECLASSIFICATIONS
Certain prior year amounts are reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. This includes the separate disclosure of changes in Income taxes within operating activities on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.
SUPPLY CHAIN FINANCING
Amounts outstanding related to supply chain financing programs are included in Accounts payable in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Accounts payable included approximately $
1,108
million and $
1,150
million as of March 31, 2025, and December 31, 2024, respectively. The impact of these programs is not material to the Company's overall liquidity.
RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
The Company considers the applicability and impact of all Accounting Standards Updates (ASUs) issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). ASUs not listed below were assessed and determined to be either not applicable or are expected to have minimal impact on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.
In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03,
Income Statement—Reporting Comprehensive Income—Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses
, which requires companies to disclose additional information about the types of expenses in commonly presented expense captions. The new standard requires tabular disclosure of specified natural expenses in certain expense captions, a qualitative description of amounts that are not separately disaggregated, and disclosure of the Company's definition and total amount of selling expenses. The ASU should be applied prospectively for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2026, with retrospective application and early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impacts of this guidance on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.
In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09,
Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Taxes Disclosures
, which requires greater disaggregation of income tax disclosures. The new standard requires additional information to be disclosed annually with respect to the income tax rate reconciliation and income taxes paid disaggregated by jurisdiction. This ASU should be applied prospectively for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with retrospective application permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impacts of this guidance on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.

In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07,
Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures
, which requires companies to enhance the disclosures about segment expenses. The new standard requires the disclosure of the Company’s Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM), expanded incremental line-item disclosures of significant segment expenses used by the CODM for decision-making, and the inclusion of previous annual only segment disclosure requirements on a quarterly basis. This ASU should be applied retrospectively for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. The Company adopted this guidance for annual disclosures for the year ended December 31, 2024, and interim disclosures for the first quarter of 2025. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.

ASSETS AND LIABILITIES HELD FOR SALE
During the third quarter of 2024, the Company concluded the assets and liabilities of the personal protective equipment (PPE) business, which is part of the Sensing and Safety Technologies business unit within the Industrial Automation reportable business segment, met the held for sale criteria; therefore, the Company presented the associated assets and liabilities of the business as held for sale as of September 30, 2024. On November 22, 2024, the Company announced it reached an agreement to sell its PPE business for $
1,325
million in an all-cash transaction. The transaction is expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2025 and is subject to customary closing conditions. The disposal group is measured at the lower of carrying value or fair value less costs to sell. Depreciation and amortization expense is not recorded for the period in which assets are classified as held for sale. The carrying amount of any assets, including goodwill, that are part of the disposal group, but not in the scope of Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 360-10,
Property, Plant, and Equipment,
are tested for impairment under the relevant guidance prior to measuring the disposal group at fair value, less costs to sell.
The Company performed an evaluation as of March 31, 2025, to assess the recoverability of the carrying value of the assets held for sale. The Company recognized a $
15
million increase to the valuation allowance during the three months ended March 31, 2025, to write down the disposal group to fair value, less costs to sell. The carrying value is based on the use of estimates and is subject to change based on future developments leading up to the closing date of a sale, and actual amounts realized upon sale may vary from those recorded as of March 31, 2025.

See Note 18
Segment Financial Data
for a summary by disaggregated product and services sales for each reportable business segment.
The Company recognizes revenue arising from performance obligations outlined in contracts with its customers that are satisfied at a point in time and over time.
The disaggregation of the Company's revenue based off timing of recognition is as follows:
CONTRACT BALANCES
The Company tracks progress on satisfying performance obligations under contracts with customers. The related billings and cash collections are recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheet in Accounts receivable—net and Other assets (unbilled receivables (contract assets) and billed receivables), and Accrued liabilities and Other liabilities (customer advances and deposits (contract liabilities)). Unbilled receivables arise when the timing of cash collected from customers differs from the timing of revenue recognition, such as when contract provisions require specific milestones to be met before a customer can be billed. Contract assets are recognized when the revenue associated with the contract is recognized prior to billing and derecognized when billed in accordance with the terms of the contract. Contract liabilities are recorded when customers remit contractual cash payments in advance of the Company satisfying performance obligations under contractual arrangements, including those with performance obligations to be satisfied over a period of time. Contract liabilities are derecognized when revenue is recorded, either when a milestone is met triggering the contractual right to bill or when the performance obligation is satisfied.

Contract balances are classified as assets or liabilities on a contract-by-contract basis at the end of each reporting period.
The following table summarizes the Company's contract assets and liabilities balances:
For the three months ended March 31, 2025, and 2024, the Company recognized revenue of $
1,000
million and $
993
million, respectively, that was previously included in the beginning balance of contract liabilities.
Contract assets included $
2,312
million and $
2,139
million of unbilled balances under long-term contracts as of March 31, 2025, and December 31, 2024, respectively. These amounts are billed in accordance with the terms of customer contracts to which they relate.
When contracts are modified to account for changes in contract specifications and requirements, the Company considers whether the modification either creates new or changes the existing enforceable rights and obligations. Contract modifications for goods or services and not distinct from the existing contract, due to the significant integration with the original good or service provided, are accounted for as if they were part of that existing contract. The effect of a contract modification on the transaction price and the Company's measure of progress for the performance obligation to which it relates, is recognized as an adjustment to revenue (either as an increase in or a reduction of revenue) on a cumulative catch-up basis. When the modifications include additional performance obligations that are distinct and at relative stand-alone selling price, they are accounted for as a new contract and performance obligation, which are recognized prospectively.
PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS
A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer and is defined as the unit of account. A contract’s transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied. When the contracts with customers require highly complex integration or manufacturing services that are not separately identifiable from other promises in the contracts and, therefore, not distinct, then the entire contract is accounted for as a single performance obligation. In situations when the Company's contracts include distinct goods or services that are substantially the same and have the same pattern of transfer to the customer over time, they are recognized as a series of distinct goods or services. For any contracts with multiple performance obligations, the Company allocates the contract’s transaction price to each performance obligation based on the estimated relative stand-alone selling price of each distinct good or service in the contract. For product sales, each product sold to a customer typically represents a distinct performance obligation. In such cases, the observable stand-alone sales are used to determine the stand-alone selling price.
Performance obligations are satisfied as of a point in time or over time. Performance obligations are supported by contracts with customers, providing a framework for the nature of the distinct goods, services, or bundle of goods and services. The timing of satisfying the performance obligation is typically indicated by the terms of the contract.
The Company's remaining performance obligations as of March 31, 2025, are $
36,097
million.
Performance obligations recognized as of March 31, 2025, will be satisfied over the course of future periods. The Company's disclosure of the timing for satisfying the performance obligation is based on the requirements of contracts with customers. However, from time to time, these contracts may be subject to modifications, impacting the timing of satisfying the performance obligations. Performance obligations expected to be satisfied within one year and greater than one year are
53
% and
47
%, respectively.
The timing of satisfaction of the Company's performance obligations does not significantly vary from the typical timing of payment. Typical payment terms of the Company's fixed price over time contracts include progress payments based on specified events or milestones or based on project progress. For some contracts, the Company may be entitled to receive an advance payment.
The Company applied the practical expedient for certain revenue streams to exclude the value of remaining performance obligations for (i) contracts with an original expected term of one year or less or (ii) contracts for which the Company recognizes revenue in proportion to the amount the Company has the right to invoice for services performed.

12
million, respectively.
OTHER CHARGES
During the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Company recognized Other charges of $
17
million related to the settle
ment of a contractual dispute with a Russian entity associated with the Company's suspension and wind down activities in Russia. The charges were recorded in Other (income) expense in the Consolidated Statement of Operations.
Given the uncertainty inherent in the Company's remaining obligations related to contracts with Russian counterparties, the Company does not believe it is possible to develop estimates of reasonably possible loss in excess of current accruals for these matters (other than as specifically set forth above). Based on available information to date, the Company’s estimate of potential future losses or other contingencies related to suspension and wind down activities, including any guarantee payments or any litigation costs or as otherwise related to the Company's wind down in Russia, could adversely affect the Company's consolidated results of operations in the periods recognized but would not be material with respect to the Company's consolidated financial position. See Note 15
Commitments and Contingencies
for a discussion of the recognition and measurement of estimate for contingencies.
NOTE 6.
INCOME TAXES
The effective tax rate was higher than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% and increased during 2025 compared to 2024 as a result of increased tax expense related to internal legal entity restructuring in advance of the anticipated sale of the PPE business.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS
The accounting guidance for fair value measurements and disclosures establishes a three-level fair value hierarchy:
•
Level 1 - Inputs are based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.
•
Level 2 - Inputs are based on observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical or similar assets and liabilities.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS
The Company is subject to various federal, state, local, and foreign government requirements relating to the protection of the environment. With respect to environmental matters involving site contamination, the Company continually conducts studies, individually or jointly with other potentially responsible parties, to determine the feasibility of various remedial techniques. It is the Company's policy to record liabilities for environmental matters when remedial efforts or damage claim payments are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. Such liabilities are based on the Company's best estimate of the undiscounted future costs required to complete the remedial work. The recorded liabilities are adjusted periodically as remediation efforts progress or as additional technical, regulatory, or legal information becomes available.
Honeywell's environmental matters are further described in Note 19 Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the Company's 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K.
The following table summarizes information concerning the Company's recorded liabilities for environmental costs:

Honeywell International Inc.
TABLE OF CONTENTS

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(Dollars in tables in millions, except per share amounts)
Environmental liabilities are included in the following balance sheet accounts:
The Company does not currently possess sufficient information to reasonably estimate the amounts of environmental liabilities to be recorded upon future completion of studies, litigation, or settlements, and neither the timing nor the amount of the ultimate costs associated with environmental matters can be determined, although they could be material to the Company's consolidated results of operations and operating cash flows in the periods recognized or paid. However, considering the Company's past experience and existing reserves, the Company does not expect that environmental matters will have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position.
In conjunction with the Resideo Technologies, Inc. (Resideo) spin-off, the Company entered into an indemnification and reimbursement agreement with a Resideo subsidiary, pursuant to which Resideo’s subsidiary has an ongoing obligation to make cash payments to Honeywell in amounts equal to
90
% of Honeywell’s annual net spending for environmental matters at certain sites as defined in the agreement. The amount payable to Honeywell in any given year is subject to a cap of $
140
million, and the obligation will continue until the earlier of December 31, 2043, or December 31 of the third consecutive year during which the annual payment obligation is less than $
25
million.
Reimbursements associated with this agreement are collected from Resideo quarterly and were $
35
million in the three months ended March 31, 2025, and offset operating cash outflows incurred by the Company. As the Company incurs costs for environmental matters deemed probable and reasonably estimable related to the sites covered by the indemnification and reimburse
ment agreement, a corresponding receivable from Resideo for
90
% of such costs is also recorded. This receivable amount recorded in the three months ended March 31, 2025, was $
90
million. As of March 31, 2025, Other current assets and Other assets included $
140
million and $
637
million, respectively, for the short-term and long-term portion of the receivable amount due from Resideo under the indemnification and reimbursement agree
ment.
ASBESTOS MATTERS
Honeywell is named in asbestos-related personal injury claims related to the Bendix Friction Materials (Bendix) business, which was sold in 2014.

Bendix asbestos-related balances are included in the following balance sheet accounts:
Bendix manufactured automotive brake linings that contained chrysotile asbestos in an encapsulated form. Claimants consist largely of individuals who allege exposure to asbestos from brakes from either performing or being in the vicinity of individuals who performed brake replacements.
The following tables present information regarding Bendix-related asbestos claims activity:
Honeywell experienced average resolution values per claim excluding legal costs as follows:
The Consolidated Financial Statements reflect an estimated liability for resolution of asserted (claims filed as of the financial statement date) and unasserted Bendix-related asbestos claims, which exclude the Company’s ongoing legal fees to defend such asbestos claims which will continue to be expensed as they are incurred.
The Company reflects the inclusion of all years of epidemiological disease projection through 2059 when estimating the liability for unasserted Bendix-related asbestos claims. Such liability for unasserted Bendix-related asbestos claims is based on historic and anticipated claims filing experience and dismissal rates, disease classifications, and average resolution values in the tort system over a defined look-back period. The Company valued Bendix asserted and unasserted claims using average resolution values for the previous two years. The Company reviews the valuation assumptions and average resolution values used to estimate the cost of Bendix asserted and unasserted claims during the fourth quarter each year.
The Company's insurance receivable corresponding to the liability for settlement of asserted and unasserted Bendix asbestos claims reflects coverage which is provided by a large number of insurance policies written by dozens of insurance companies in both the domestic insurance market and the London excess market. Based on the Company's ongoing analysis of the probable insurance recovery, insurance receivables are recorded in the financial statements simultaneous with the recording of the estimated liability for the underlying asbestos claims. This determination is based on the Company's analysis of the underlying insurance policies, historical experience with insurers, ongoing review of the solvency of insurers, judicial determinations relevant to insurance programs, and consideration of the impacts of any settlements reached with the Company's insurers.

SEC MATTER
The Company is cooperating with a formal investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) which is primarily focused on certain accounting matters with respect to the Company's former Performance Materials and Technologies segment. At this time, the Company does not expect the outcome of this matter to have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated results of operations, cash flows, or financial position.
PETROBRAS AND UNAOIL MATTERS
On December 19, 2022, the Company reached a comprehensive resolution to the investigations by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), the SEC, and certain Brazilian authorities (Brazilian Authorities) relating to the Company's use of third parties who previously worked for the Company's UOP business in Brazil in relation to a project awarded in 2010 for Petróleo Brasileiro S.A. (Petrobras). The investigations focused on the Company’s compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar Brazilian laws (UOP Matters). The comprehensive resolution also resolves DOJ and SEC investigations relating to a matter involving a foreign subsidiary’s prior contract with Unaoil S.A.M. in Algeria executed in 2011 (the Unaoil Matter).
In connection with the comprehensive resolution, (i) the Company agreed to pay a total equivalent of $
203
million, which payment occurred in January 2023, to the DOJ, the SEC, and the Brazilian Authorities, collectively, in penalties, disgorgement, and prejudgment interest, (ii) the Company’s subsidiary, UOP, LLC (UOP), entered into a
three-year
Deferred Prosecution Agreement (DPA) with the DOJ for charges related to the UOP Matters, (iii) UOP entered into leniency agreements with the Brazilian Authorities related to the UOP Matter in Brazil, and (iv) the Company entered into an agreement with the SEC that resolves allegations relating to the UOP Matters and the Unaoil Matter. Pursuant to these agreements, the Company agreed to undertake certain compliance measures and compliance reporting obligations. These agreements entirely resolved the Petrobras and Unaoil investigations.
OTHER MATTERS
The Company is subject to a number of other lawsuits, investigations, and disputes (some of which involve substantial amounts claimed) arising out of the conduct of the Company's business, including matters relating to commercial transactions, government contracts, product liability, prior acquisitions and divestitures, employee benefit plans, intellectual property, and environmental, health, and safety matters. The Company recognizes liabilities for any contingency that is probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable. The Company continually assesses the likelihood of adverse judgments or outcomes in such matters, as well as potential ranges of probable losses (taking into consideration any insurance recoveries), based on a careful analysis of each matter with the assistance of outside legal counsel and, if applicable, other experts.
Given the uncertainty inherent in litigation and investigations, including those discussed in this Note 15, the Company cannot predict when or how these matters will be resolved and does not believe it is possible to develop estimates of reasonably possible loss (or a range of possible loss) in excess of current accruals for commitment and contingency matters. Considering the Company's past experience and existing accruals, the Company does not expect the outcome of such matters, either individually or in the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated financial position. Because most contingencies are resolved over long periods of time, potential liabilities are subject to change due to new developments, changes in settlement strategy or the impact of evidentiary requirements, which could cause the Company to pay damage awards or settlements (or become subject to equitable remedies) that could have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated results of operations or operating cash flows in the periods recognized or paid.

SEGMENT FINANCIAL DATA
Honeywell globally manages its business operations through
four
reportable business segments. Segment information is consistent with how the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, who is the Company's chief operating decision maker, and management reviews the businesses, makes investing and resource allocation decisions, and assesses operating performance.
Effective during the second quarter of 2024, the Company updated its calculation of segment profit to exclude the impact of amortization expense for acquisition-related intangible assets and certain acquisition-related costs.
The Company recast historical periods to reflect segment profit
under this new basis to facilitate comparability. In the third quarter of 2024, the Company clarified its calculation of segment profit to exclude divestiture-related costs and impairments.
Honeywell’s senior management evaluates segment performance based on segment profit. Each segment’s profit is measured as segment income (loss) before taxes excluding general corporate unallocated expense, interest and other financial charges, interest income, amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, certain acquisition- and divestiture-related costs, impairment of assets held for sale, stock compensation expense, pension and other postretirement income (expense), repositioning and other charges, and other items within Other (income) expense.

The following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is intended to help the reader understand the results of operations and financial condition of Honeywell International Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries (Honeywell, we, us, our, or the Company) for the three months ended March 31, 2025. The financial information as of March 31, 2025, should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2024, contained in our 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Certain prior year amounts are reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.
BUSINESS UPDATE
MACROECONOMIC CONDITIONS
We are closely monitoring evolving macroeconomic conditions and heightened geopolitical risks. During the first quarter of 2025, there was a marked increase in economic and trade policy uncertainty globally. Rising trade tensions and changes to trade policy could adversely impact global growth and contribute to inflationary pressures. Global conflicts, tariffs, labor disruptions, and regulations continue to generate volatility in global markets and can contribute to supply chain vulnerabilities and pricing fluctuations. We remain proactive in our collaboration with suppliers to mitigate potential shortages and reduce supply and price volatility. We anticipate a moderation in global growth in 2025 and a higher level of uncertainty with respect to inflation and other macroeconomic trends.
Mitigation strategies remain crucial to meet customer demand in this evolving environment. Our mitigation strategies include pricing actions, hedging strategies, long-term strategies for constrained materials, direct engagement with key suppliers, and new supplier development. Strong relationships with strategic primary and secondary suppliers allow us to collaborate together to reliably source key components and raw materials, develop new products, commit our resources to assist certain suppliers, and at times, alter designs of existing products. We believe these mitigation strategies enable us to reduce supply risk, foster new product innovation, and expand our market presence. Additionally, due to the stringent quality controls and product qualification we perform on any new or altered product, these mitigation strategies have not impacted, and we do not expect them to impact, product quality or reliability.
To date, our strategies successfully mitigated our exposure to these conditions. However, if we are not successful in sustaining or executing these strategies, these macroeconomic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations or operating cash flows.
SPIN-OFF OF ADVANCED MATERIALS
On October 8, 2024, the Company announced its intention to spin off its Advanced Materials business into Solstice Advanced Materials, an independent, U.S. publicly traded company, which is targeted to be completed by the end of 2025 or early 2026. The planned spin-off is intended to be a tax-free spin to Honeywell shareowners for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The spin-off will be subject to the satisfaction of a number of customary conditions, including, among others, finalization of the financial statements of Solstice Advanced Materials, the filing and effectiveness of applicable filings (including a Form 10 registration statement) with the SEC, assurance that the spin-off of Solstice Advanced Materials will be tax-free to Honeywell’s shareowners, receipt of applicable regulatory approvals, and final approval by Honeywell’s Board of Directors. The proposed spin-off is complex in nature, and may be affected by unanticipated developments, credit and equity markets, or changes in market conditions.

Honeywell International Inc.
TABLE OF CONTENTS
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
(Dollars in tables in millions)
We leverage operating cash flows as the primary source of liquidity. Each of our businesses focuses on increasing operating cash flows through revenue growth, margin expansion, and improved working capital turnover. We also maintain other key sources of liquidity, including U.S. cash balances, and the ability to access non-U.S. cash balances, short-term debt from the commercial paper market, long-term borrowings, committed credit lines, and access to the public debt and equity markets.
CASH
As of March 31, 2025, and December 31, 2024, we held $10.1 billion and $11.0 billion, respectively, of cash and cash equivalents, including our short-term investments. We monitor third-party depository institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents on a daily basis. Our emphasis is primarily safety of principal and secondarily maximizing yield of those funds. We diversify our cash and cash equivalents among counterparties to minimize exposure to any one counterparty.
As of March 31, 2025, we held $8.0 billion of the Company’s cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments in non-U.S. subsidiaries. We do not have material amounts related to any jurisdiction subject to currency control restrictions that impact our ability to access and repatriate such amounts. Under current laws, we do not expect taxes on repatriation or restrictions on amounts held outside of the U.S. to have a material effect on our overall liquidity.
CASH FLOW SUMMARY
Our cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities, as reflected in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, are summarized as follows:
Three months ended March 31, 2025
Net cash provided by operating activities was driven by Net income, partially offset by changes in working capital driven by an increase in accounts receivable due to timing of customer cash collections.
Net cash used for investing activities was driven by $251 million of capital expenditures and $125 million of net payments from settlements of derivative contracts.
Net cash used for financing activities was driven by $1,902 million of repurchases of common stock and $732 million of cash dividends paid, partially offset by $1,442 million of net proceeds of commercial paper.
44
Honeywell International Inc.
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Three months ended March 31, 2025 compared with three months ended March 31, 2024
Net cash provided by operating activities increased by $149 million, driven by a $423 million favorable impact of other operating activities due to timing of customer advances, partially offset by a $286 million unfavorable impact of working capital driven by an increase in accounts receivable due to timing of customer cash collections.
Net cash used for investing activities increased by $98 million, driven by a $168 million net increase in payments from settlements of derivative contracts, partially offset by $70 million net decrease in investments.
Net cash (used for) provided by financing activities decreased by $4,876 million, driven by a $5,664 million decrease in long-term debt proceeds, as we issued long-term debt in 2024 to fund acquisitions, and a $1,231 million increase in repurchases of common stock, partially offset by a $1,689 million increase in net proceeds of commercial paper and a $529 million decrease in payments of long-term debt.
CASH REQUIREMENTS AND ASSESSMENT OF CURRENT LIQUIDITY
In addition to our normal operating cash requirements, our principal future cash requirements will include funding capital expenditures, share repurchases, dividends, strategic acquisitions, and debt repayments. During the three months ended March 31, 2025, we repurchased common stock of $1.9 billion. Refer to the section titled Liquidity and Capital Resources of our 2024 Form 10-K for a discussion of our expected capital expenditures, share repurchases, mergers and acquisitions activity, and dividends for 2025.
We continually seek opportunities to improve our liquidity and working capital efficiency, which includes the extension of payment terms with our suppliers and transfer of our trade receivables to unaffiliated financial institutions on a true sale basis. The impact of these programs is not material to our overall liquidity.
Additionally, we continue to assess the relative strength of each business in our portfolio as to strategic fit, market position, profit, and cash flow contribution in order to identify target investment and acquisition opportunities in order to upgrade our combined portfolio. We identify acquisition candidates that will further our strategic plan and strengthen our existing core businesses. In the first quarter of 2025, we announced our intention to acquire Sundyne for approximately $2.2 billion. We also identify businesses that do not fit into our long-term strategic plan based on their market position, relative profitability, or growth potential. These businesses are considered for potential divestiture, restructuring, or other repositioning actions, subject to regulatory constraints. On October 8, 2024, we announced our intention to spin off the Advanced Materials business into Solstice Advanced Materials, an independent, U.S. publicly traded company, which is targeted to be completed by the end of 2025 or early 2026. In addition, on November 22, 2024, we announced an agreement to sell our personal protective equipment business for $1.3 billion, with the assets and liabilities of the business classified as held for sale until the closing date of a sale. On February 6, 2025, the Company announced its intention to separate its Automation and Aerospace Technologies businesses into independent, U.S. publicly traded companies. See Note 3

Based on past performance and current expectations, we believe that our operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our future operating cash needs for at least the next twelve months. Our available cash, committed credit lines, and access to the public debt and equity markets provide additional sources of short-term and long-term liquidity to fund current operations, debt maturities, and future investment opportunities.

BORROWINGS
We leverage a variety of debt instruments to manage our overall borrowing costs. As of March 31, 2025, and December 31, 2024, our total borrowings were $32.8 billion and $31.1 billion, respectively.
A key source of liquidity is our ability to access the corporate bond markets. Through these markets, we issue a variety of long-term fixed rate notes to manage our overall funding costs.
Another key source of liquidity is our ability to access the commercial paper market. Commercial paper notes are sold at a discount or premium and have a maturity of not more than 365 days from date of issuance. Borrowings under the commercial paper program are available for general corporate purposes as well as for financing acquisitions.
We also have the following loan and revolving credit agreements:
•
A $1.0 billion Fixed Rate Term Loan Credit Agreement (the Fixed Rate Term Loan Credit Agreement), dated as of August 12, 2024. Amounts borrowed under the Fixed Rate Term Loan Credit Agreement are required to be repaid no later than August 12, 2027, unless the Fixed Rate Term Loan Credit Agreement is terminated earlier pursuant to its terms. As of March 31, 2025, there were $1.0 billion of borrowings outstanding under the Fixed Rate Term Loan Credit Agreement.
•
A $3.0 billion 364-day credit agreement (the 364-Day Credit Agreement) with a syndicate of banks, dated as of March 17, 2025. Amounts borrowed under the 364-Day Credit Agreement are required to be repaid no later than March 16, 2026, unless (i) we elect to convert all then outstanding amounts into a term loan, upon which such amounts shall be repaid in full on March 16, 2027, or (ii) the 364-Day Credit Agreement is terminated earlier pursuant to its terms. The 364-Day Credit Agreement replaced the previously reported $1.5 billion 364-day credit agreement dated as of March 18, 2024, which was terminated in accordance with its terms effective March 17, 2025. As of March 31, 2025, there were no outstanding borrowings under our 364-Day Credit Agreement.
•
A $4.0 billion five-year credit agreement (the Five-Year Credit Agreement) with a syndicate of banks, dated as of March 18, 2024. Commitments under the Five-Year Credit Agreement can be increased pursuant to the terms of the Five-Year Credit Agreement to an aggregate amount not to exceed $4.5 billion. As of March 31, 2025, there were no outstanding borrowings under our Five-Year Credit Agreement.
See Note 9
Debt and Credit Agreements
of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our debt instruments.
We also maintain a current shelf registration statement filed with the SEC under which we may issue additional debt securities, common stock, and preferred stock that may be offered in one or more offerings on terms to be determined at the time of the offering. We anticipate that net proceeds of any offering would be used for general corporate purposes, including repayment of existing indebtedness, share repurchases, capital expenditures, and acquisitions.

Other than as noted below, there have been no material changes to our Risk Factors presented in our 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K under the section titled Risk Factors. For further discussion of our Risk Factors, refer to the section titled Risk Factors in our 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K.
The Company and each of our businesses is subject to unique industry and economic conditions that may adversely affect the markets and operating conditions of our customers, which in turn can affect demand for our products and services and our results of operations.
•
Aerospace Technologies
—Our Aerospace business is impacted by customer buying patterns of aftermarket parts, supplier stability, factory transitions, and global supply chain capacity constraints that may lead to shortages of crucial components. Operating results may be adversely affected by downturns in the global demand for air travel, which may impact new aircraft production or result in the delay or cancellation of new aircraft orders, delays in launch schedules for new aircrafts, the retirement of aircrafts, and reductions in global flying hours, which impacts air transport and regional, business, and general aviation aircraft utilization rates. Operating results may also be adversely affected by any decrease in air travel demand due to regional restrictions or suspension of service for events related to public health, safety, the environment, or regional conflicts. Operating results could also be impacted by changes in overall trends related to end market demand for the product portfolio, as well as new entrants and non-traditional players entering the market. Operating results in our Defense and Space business unit may be affected by the mix of U.S. and foreign government appropriations for defense and space programs and by compliance risks. Results may also be impacted by the potential introduction of counterfeit parts into our global supply chain.
•
Industrial Automation
—Operating results may be adversely impacted by reduced investments in process automation, safety monitoring, and plant capacity utilization initiatives, fluctuations in retail markets, a slowdown in demand for safety products, changes in the competitive landscape, including new market entrants and new technologies that may lead to product commoditization, and adverse industry economic conditions, all of which could result in lower market share, reduced selling prices, and lower margins.
•
Building Automation
—Operating results may be adversely impacted by downturns in the level of global buildings and infrastructure construction activity (including retrofits and upgrades), lower capital spending and operating expenditures on projects, changes in the competitive landscape, including new market entrants and new technologies, and fluctuations in inventory levels in distribution channels.
•
Energy and Sustainability Solutions
—Operating results may be adversely impacted by downturns in capacity utilization for chemical, industrial, refining, petrochemical, and semiconductor plants, our customers’ availability of capital for refinery construction and expansion, raw material demand and supply, product commoditization, continued illegal imports of hydrofluorocarbons into Europe, and our ability to maximize our facilities’ production capacity and minimize downtime. Periods of increased volatility in oil and natural gas prices may result in less investment by our customers and therefore, lower demand for our products and services.
In addition, the Company and each of its businesses may continue to be, negatively affected by global macroeconomic conditions, including the impacts of inflation, high interest rates, supply chain and labor disruptions, unemployment rates, geopolitical instability and regional conflicts, the adoption and expansion of trade restrictions and tariffs, quotas, embargoes, and other related actions, and the occurrence or threat of a trade war or other governmental action related to tariffs or trade agreements or policies. Such factors could adversely impact, demand for our products, our costs, our customers, our suppliers, and the world and U.S. economies. The impact of such factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, cash flows, and financial condition.

ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS
On April 24, 2023, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $10 billion of Honeywell common stock, including approximately $2.1 billion of remaining availability under the previously announced $10 billion share repurchase authorization. The repurchase authorization does not have an expiration date and may be amended or terminated by the Board of Directors at any time without prior notice.
Repurchases may be made through a variety of methods, which could include open market purchases, accelerated share repurchase transactions, negotiated block transactions, 10b5-1 plans, other transactions that may be structured through investment banking institutions or privately negotiated, or a combination of the foregoing. Honeywell presently expects to repurchase outstanding shares from time to time (i) to offset the dilutive impact of employee stock-based compensation plans, including option exercises, restricted unit vesting, and matching contributions under our savings plans, and (ii) to reduce share count via share repurchases as and when attractive opportunities arise. The amount and timing of future repurchases may vary depending on market conditions and the level of operating, financing, and other investing activities.
During the three months ended March 31, 2025, Honeywell repurchased 8.9 million shares of its common stock, par value $1 per share. As of March 31, 2025, $3.6 billion remained available under the share repurchase authorization for additional share repurchases. The following table summarizes our purchases of Honeywell's common stock for the three months ended March 31, 2025:
