As of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, Other Investments includes Level III Freestanding Derivatives.
A summary of the investments where the fair value is not readily determinable and NAV is used as a practical expedient as of March 31, 2025 is presented by strategy type below:
Represents freestanding derivatives, corporate treasury investments and Other Investments.
Transfers in and out of Level III financial assets and liabilities were due to changes in the observability of inputs used in the valuation of such assets and liabilities.
For Freestanding Derivatives included within Other Investments, Settlements includes all ongoing contractual cash payments made or received over the life of the instrument.
Amounts presented are inclusive of both legally enforceable master netting agreements, and financial instruments received or pledged as collateral. Financial instruments received or pledged as collateral offset derivative counterparty risk exposure, but do not reduce net balance sheet exposure.
Fair value is determined by broker quote and these notes would be classified as Level II within the fair value hierarchy.
CLO Notes Payable have maturity dates ranging from June 2025 to January 2037. A portion of the borrowing outstanding is comprised of subordinated notes which do not have contractual interest rates but instead pay distributions from the excess cash flows of the CLO vehicles. As of March 31, 2025, the CLO Notes Payable were deconsolidated.
The Secured Borrowings Due 10/27/2033 and 1/29/2035 were repaid during the three months ended March 31, 2025.
Represents the Revolving Credit Facility of Blackstone, through Blackstone Holdings Finance Co. L.L.C. Interest on the borrowings is based on an adjusted Secured Overnight Finance Rate (“SOFR”) or alternate base rate, in each case plus a margin, and undrawn commitments bear a commitment fee of 0.06%. The margin above adjusted SOFR used to calculate interest on borrowings was 0.75% plus an additional credit spread adjustment of 0.10% to account for the difference between London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) and SOFR. The margin is subject to change based on Blackstone’s credit rating. Borrowings may also be made in U.K. sterling, euros, Swiss francs, Japanese yen or Canadian dollars, in each case subject to certain sub-limits. The Revolving Credit Facility contains customary representations, covenants and events of default. Financial covenants consist of a maximum net leverage ratio and a requirement to keep a minimum amount of fee-earning assets under management, each tested quarterly. As of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, Blackstone had outstanding but undrawn letters of credit against the Revolving Credit Facility of $40.4 million and $38.9 million, respectively. The amount Blackstone can draw from the Credit Facility is reduced by the undrawn letters of credit.
Unobservable inputs were weighted based on the fair value of the investments included in the range.
Fee related performance compensation may include equity-based compensation based on fee related performance revenues.
This adjustment reverses the effect of consolidating Blackstone Funds, which are excluded from Blackstone’s segment presentation. This adjustment includes the elimination of Blackstone’s interest in these funds, the removal of amounts attributable to the reimbursement of certain expenses by the Blackstone Funds and certain NAV-based fee arrangements, which are presented on a gross basis under GAAP but as a reduction of Management and Advisory Fees, Net in the Total Segment measures, and the removal of amounts associated with the ownership of Blackstone consolidated operating partnerships held by non-controlling interests.
Represents the (1) removal of Transaction-Related and Non-Recurring Items that are not recorded in the Total Segment measures, (2) removal of amounts attributable to certain expenses that are reimbursed by the Blackstone Funds and certain NAV-based fee arrangements, which are presented on a gross basis under GAAP but as a reduction of Management and Advisory Fees, Net in the Total Segment measures, and (3) a reduction equal to an administrative fee collected on a quarterly basis from certain holders of Blackstone Holdings Partnership Units which is accounted for as a capital contribution under GAAP, but is reflected as a reduction of Other Operating Expenses in Blackstone’s segment presentation.
Represents (1) the add back of Principal Investment Income, including general partner income, earned from consolidated Blackstone funds which have been eliminated in consolidation, and (2) the removal of amounts associated with the ownership of Blackstone consolidated operating partnerships held by non-controlling interests.
Represents the removal of Transaction-Related and Non-Recurring Items that are not recorded in the Total Segment measures.
Represents (1) the add back of net management fees earned from consolidated Blackstone Funds which have been eliminated in consolidation, and (2) the removal of amounts attributable to the reimbursement of certain expenses by the Blackstone Funds and certain NAV-based fee arrangements, which are presented on a gross basis under GAAP but as a reduction of Management and Advisory Fees, Net in the Total Segment measures.
Represents the add back of Performance Revenues earned from consolidated Blackstone funds which have been eliminated in consolidation.
This adjustment adds an amount equal to an administrative fee collected on a quarterly basis from certain holders of Blackstone Holdings Partnership Units. The administrative fee is accounted for as a capital contribution under GAAP, but is reflected as a reduction of Other Operating Expenses in Blackstone’s segment presentation.
As of March 31, 2025, Blackstone had no unfunded commitments.
This adjustment removes Transaction-Related and Non-Recurring Items, which are excluded from Blackstone’s segment presentation. Transaction-Related and Non-Recurring Items arise from corporate actions including acquisitions, divestitures, Blackstone’s initial public offering and non-recurring gains, losses, or other charges, if any. They consist primarily of equity-based compensation charges, gains and losses on contingent consideration arrangements, changes in the balance of the Tax Receivable Agreement resulting from a change in tax law or similar event, transaction costs, gains or losses associated with these corporate actions and non-recurring gains, losses or other charges that affect period to period comparability and are not reflective of Blackstone’s operational performance.
Total Segment Revenues is comprised of the following:
This adjustment removes Unrealized Performance Revenues on a segment basis.
This adjustment removes Unrealized Principal Investment Income (Loss) on a segment basis.
This adjustment removes Interest and Dividend Revenue on a segment basis.
This adjustment removes Other Revenue on a segment basis. For the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, Other Revenue on a GAAP basis was $(73.6) million and $44.8 million, and included $(73.8) million and $44.5 million of foreign exchange gains (losses), respectively.
Total Segment Expenses is comprised of the following:
This adjustment removes Unrealized Performance Allocations Compensation.
This adjustment removes Equity-Based Compensation on a segment basis.
This adjustment adds back Interest Expense on a segment basis, excluding interest expense related to the tax receivable agreement.
This adjustment removes the amortization of transaction-related intangibles, which are excluded from Blackstone’s segment presentation.
The volatility of the historical performance of the underlying reference entities or an appropriate proxy is used to project the expected returns relevant for the fair value of the derivatives.
As of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, Other Liabilities includes Level III Contingent Consideration and Level III Corporate Treasury Commitments.

Table of Contents
“Our hedge funds” refers to our funds of hedge funds, hedge funds, certain of our real estate debt investment funds and certain other credit-focused funds which are managed by Blackstone.
We refer to our separately managed accounts as “SMAs.”
“Total Assets Under Management” refers to the invested and available capital in Blackstone-managed or advised vehicles (including, without limitation, investment funds and SMAs). The Total Assets Under Management attributable to an individual vehicle is dependent on the structure and investment strategy of such vehicle and accordingly, will vary from vehicle to vehicle. Total Assets Under Management generally equals the sum of the following across Blackstone-managed or advised vehicles, as applicable:
Uncalled commitments represent the capital we are entitled to call from investors pursuant to the terms of their respective capital commitments, including capital commitments to funds that have yet to commence their investment periods. Drawdown funds, perpetual capital vehicles, co-investment vehicles, and SMAs can each be structured with a commitment from an investor that is called over time as opposed to fully funded upon subscription.
Assets may be raised in one vehicle or business unit and subsequently invested in or managed or advised by another vehicle or business unit. Total Assets Under Management are reported in the segment where the assets are managed.
Our measurement of Total Assets Under Management includes commitments to, and the fair value of, invested capital in our funds from Blackstone and our personnel. Our calculation of Total Assets Under Management may differ from the calculations of other asset managers, and as a result this measure may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other asset managers. Our definition of Total Assets Under Management differs from the manner in which affiliated investment advisors report regulatory assets under management and may differ from the definition set forth in the agreements governing the vehicles we manage or advise.
“Fee-Earning Assets Under Management” refers to the portion of Total Assets Under Management on which we are entitled to earn management fees and/or performance revenues. The Fee-Earning Assets Under Management attributable to an individual vehicle is driven by the basis on which fees are earned and accordingly, will vary from vehicle to vehicle. Fee-Earning Assets Under Management generally equals the sum of the following across Blackstone-managed or advised vehicles, as applicable: (a) net asset value, (b) committed capital and remaining invested capital during the investment period and post-investment period, respectively, (c) invested capital (including leverage to the extent management fee-eligible), (d) gross asset value, (e) fair value of investments, or (f) the aggregate par amount of collateral assets, including principal cash, of CLOs.
Assets may be raised in one vehicle or business unit and subsequently invested in or managed or advised by another vehicle or business unit. Fee-Earning Assets Under Management are reported in the segment where the Total Assets Under Management are reported to the extent fee-paying to Blackstone.

While Fee-Earning Assets Under Management generally reflects Total Assets Under Management on which we are entitled to earn management fees, Fee-Earning Assets Under Management may also include Total Assets Under Management on which we are entitled to earn only performance revenues. Our calculation of Fee-Earning Assets Under Management may differ from the calculations of other asset managers, and as a result this measure may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other asset managers. Our definition of Fee-Earning Assets Under Management may differ from the definition set forth in the agreements governing the vehicles that we manage or advise.
“Perpetual Capital” refers to the component of assets under management with an indefinite term, that is not in liquidation, and for which there is no requirement to return capital to investors through redemption requests in the ordinary course of business, except where funded by new capital inflows or where required redemptions are limited in quantum. Perpetual Capital includes co-investment capital with an investor right to convert into Perpetual Capital.
Commitment-based drawdown structured funds generally do not permit investors to redeem their interests at their election. Certain of our open-ended vehicles generally afford an investor the right to withdraw or redeem their interests on a periodic basis (for example, annually, quarterly or monthly), typically with 2 to 95 days’ notice, depending on the fund and the liquidity profile of the underlying assets. In our perpetual capital vehicles where redemption rights exist, redemption requests are required to be fulfilled only (a) in Blackstone’s or the vehicles’ board’s discretion, as applicable, (b) to the extent there is sufficient new capital, or (c) where such required redemptions are limited in quantum, such as interval funds or in certain insurance-dedicated vehicles. Investment advisory agreements related to certain SMAs in our Credit & Insurance and Multi-Asset Investing segments, excluding SMAs in our insurance platform, may generally be terminated by an investor on 15 to 95 days’ notice. SMAs in our insurance platform can generally only be terminated for long-term underperformance, cause and certain other limited circumstances, in each case subject to Blackstone’s right to cure.
This report does not constitute an offer of any Blackstone Fund.

Blackstone Inc., together with its consolidated subsidiaries (“Blackstone” or the “Company”), is the world’s largest alternative asset manager. Blackstone’s asset management business includes global investment strategies focused on real estate, private equity, infrastructure, life sciences, growth equity, credit, real assets, secondaries and hedge funds. “Blackstone Funds” refers to the funds and other vehicles that are managed by Blackstone. Blackstone’s business is organized into
four
segments: Real Estate, Private Equity, Credit & Insurance and Multi-Asset Investing.
Blackstone Inc. was initially formed as The Blackstone Group L.P., a Delaware limited partnership, on March 12, 2007. Prior to its conversion on July 1, 2019 to a Delaware corporation, Blackstone Inc. was managed and operated by Blackstone Group Management L.L.C., which is wholly owned by Blackstone’s senior managing directors and controlled by
one
of Blackstone’s founders, Stephen A. Schwarzman (the “Founder”).
The activities of Blackstone are conducted through its holding partnerships: Blackstone Holdings I L.P., Blackstone Holdings AI L.P., Blackstone Holdings II L.P., Blackstone Holdings III L.P. and Blackstone Holdings IV L.P. (collectively, “Blackstone Holdings,” “Blackstone Holdings Partnerships” or the “Holding Partnerships”). Blackstone, through its wholly owned subsidiaries, is the sole general partner of each of the Holding Partnerships. Generally, holders of the limited partner interests in the Holding Partnerships may, four times each year, exchange their limited partnership interests (“Partnership Units”) for Blackstone common stock, on a one-to-one basis, exchanging one Partnership Unit from each of the Holding Partnerships for one share of Blackstone common stock.
Basis of Presentation
The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of Blackstone have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) for interim financial information and the instructions to Form 10-Q. The condensed consolidated financial statements, including these notes, are unaudited and exclude some of the disclosures required in audited financial statements. Management believes it has made all necessary adjustments (consisting of only normal recurring items) so that the condensed consolidated financial statements are presented fairly and that estimates made in preparing its condensed consolidated financial statements are reasonable. The operating results presented for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for any other interim period or for the entire year. These condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements included in Blackstone’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Blackstone, its wholly owned or majority-owned subsidiaries, the consolidated entities which are considered to be variable interest entities and for which Blackstone is considered the primary beneficiary, and certain partnerships or similar entities which are not considered variable interest entities but in which the general partner is determined to have control.
All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Consolidation
Blackstone consolidates all entities that it controls through a majority voting interest or otherwise, including those Blackstone Funds in which the general partner has a controlling financial interest. Blackstone has a controlling financial interest in Blackstone Holdings because the limited partners do not have the right to dissolve the partnerships or have substantive kick-out rights or participating rights that would overcome the control held by Blackstone. Accordingly, Blackstone consolidates Blackstone Holdings and records non-controlling interests to reflect the economic interests of the limited partners of Blackstone Holdings.

In addition, Blackstone consolidates all variable interest entities (“VIE”) for which it is the primary beneficiary. An enterprise is determined to be the primary beneficiary if it holds a controlling financial interest. A controlling financial interest is defined as (a) the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance and (b) the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the VIE. The consolidation guidance requires an analysis to determine (a) whether an entity in which Blackstone holds a variable interest is a VIE and (b) whether Blackstone’s involvement, through holding interests directly or indirectly in the entity or contractually through other variable interests, would give it a controlling financial interest. Performance of that analysis requires the exercise of judgment.
Blackstone determines whether it is the primary beneficiary of a VIE at the time it becomes involved with a variable interest entity and continuously reconsiders that conclusion. In determining whether Blackstone is the primary beneficiary, Blackstone evaluates its control rights as well as economic interests in the entity held either directly or indirectly by Blackstone. The consolidation analysis can generally be performed qualitatively; however, if it is not readily apparent that Blackstone is not the primary beneficiary, a quantitative analysis may also be performed. Investments and redemptions (either by Blackstone, affiliates of Blackstone or third parties) or amendments to the governing documents of the respective Blackstone Funds could affect an entity’s status as a VIE or the determination of the primary beneficiary. At each reporting date, Blackstone assesses whether it is the primary beneficiary and will consolidate or deconsolidate accordingly.
Assets of consolidated VIEs that can only be used to settle obligations of the consolidated VIE and liabilities of a consolidated VIE for which creditors (or beneficial interest holders) do not have recourse to the general credit of Blackstone are presented in a separate section in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition.
Blackstone’s other disclosures regarding VIEs are discussed in Note 8. “Variable Interest Entities.”
Revenue Recognition
Revenues primarily consist of management and advisory fees, incentive fees, investment income, interest and dividend revenue and other.
Management and advisory fees and incentive fees are accounted for as contracts with customers. Under the guidance for contracts with customers, an entity is required to (a) identify the contract(s) with a customer, (b) identify the performance obligations in the contract, (c) determine the transaction price, (d) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract, and (e) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. In determining the transaction price, an entity may include variable consideration only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized would not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved. See Note 17. “Segment Reporting” for a disaggregated presentation of revenues from contracts with customers.
Management and Advisory Fees, Net
— Management and Advisory Fees, Net are com
prise
d of management fees, including base management fees, transaction, advisory and other fees net of management fee reductions and offsets.
Blackstone earns base management fees from its customers at a fixed percentage of a calculation base which is typically net asset value, gross asset value, total fair value of investments, committed capital, total invested capital or remaining invested capital. Blackstone identifies its customers on a fund by fund basis in accordance with the terms and circumstances of the individual fund. Generally the customer is identified as the investors in its
14

Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) - Continued
(All Dollars are in Thousands, Except Share and Per Share Data, Except Where Noted)
managed funds and investment vehicles, but for certain widely held funds or vehicles, the fund or vehicle itself may be identified as the customer. These customer contracts require Blackstone to provide investment management services, which represents a performance obligation that Blackstone satisfies over time. Management fees are a form of variable consideration because the fees Blackstone is entitled to vary based on fluctuations in the basis for the management fee. The amount recorded as revenue is generally determined at the end of the period because these management fees are payable on a regular basis (typically quarterly) and are not subject to clawback once paid.
Transaction, advisory and other fees are principally fees charged to the investors of funds indirectly through the managed funds and portfolio companies. The investment advisory agreements generally require that the investment adviser reduce the amount of management fees payable by the investors to Blackstone (“management fee reductions”) by an amount equal to a portion of the transaction and other fees paid to Blackstone by the portfolio companies. The amount of the reduction varies by fund, the type of fee paid by the portfolio company and the previously incurred expenses of the fund. These fees and associated management fee reductions are a component of the transaction price for Blackstone’s performance obligation to provide investment management services to the investors of funds and are recognized as changes to the transaction price in the period in which they are charged and the services are performed.
Management fee offsets are reductions to management fees payable by the investors of the Blackstone Funds, which are based on the amount such investors reimburse the Blackstone Funds or Blackstone primarily for placement fees. Providing investment management services requires Blackstone to arrange for services on behalf of its customers. In those situations where Blackstone is acting as an agent on behalf of the investors of funds, it presents the cost of services as net against management fee revenue. In all other situations, Blackstone is primarily responsible for fulfilling the services and is therefore acting as a principal for those arrangements. As a result, the cost of those services is presented as Compensation or General, Administrative and Other expense, as appropriate, with any reimbursement from the investors of the funds recorded as Management and Advisory Fees, Net. In cases where the investors of the funds are determined to be the customer in an arrangement, placement fees may be capitalized as a cost to acquire a customer contract. Capitalized placement fees are amortized over the life of the customer contract, are recorded within Other Assets in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition and amortization is recorded within General, Administrative and Other within the Consolidated Statements of Operations. In cases where the Blackstone Funds are determined to be the customer in the arrangement, placement fees are generally expensed as incurred. Blackstone may also pay ongoing investor servicing fees to certain distributors of its products. Where Blackstone is the principal in those arrangements, ongoing investor servicing fees are expensed as incurred and are recorded within General, Administrative and Other expense.
Accrued but unpaid Management and Advisory Fees, net of management fee reductions and management fee offsets, as of the reporting date are included in Due from Affiliates in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition.
Incentive Fees
— Contractual fees earned based on the performance of Blackstone vehicles (“Incentive Fees”) are a form of variable consideration in Blackstone’s contracts with customers to provide investment management services. Incentive Fees are earned based on performance of the vehicle during the period, subject to the achievement of minimum return levels, or high water marks, in accordance with the respective terms set out in each vehicle’s governing agreements. Incentive Fees will not be recognized as revenue until (a) it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur, or (b) the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved. Incentive Fees are typically recognized as revenue when realized at the end of the measurement period. Once realized, such fees are not subject to clawback or reversal. Accrued but unpaid Incentive Fees charged directly to investors in Blackstone vehicles as of the reporting date are recorded within Due from Affiliates in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition.

Investment Income (Loss)
— Investment Income (Loss) represents the unrealized and realized gains and losses on Blackstone’s Performance Allocations and Principal Investments.
In carry fund structures and certain open-ended structures, Blackstone, through its subsidiaries, invests alongside its limited partners in a partnership and is entitled to its pro-rata share of the results of the fund vehicle (a “pro-rata allocation”). In addition to a pro-rata allocation, and assuming certain investment returns are achieved, Blackstone is entitled to a disproportionate allocation of the income otherwise allocable to the limited partners, commonly referred to as carried interest (“Performance Allocations”).
Performance Allocations are made to the general partner based either on cumulative fund performance to date, subject to a preferred return to limited partners or based on vehicle performance over a period of time, subject to a high water mark and preferred return to investors. At the end of each reporting period, Blackstone calculates the balance of accrued Performance Allocations (“Accrued Performance Allocations”) that would be due to Blackstone for each fund, pursuant to the fund agreements, as if the fair value of the underlying investments were realized as of such date, irrespective of whether such amounts have been realized. As the fair value of underlying investments varies between reporting periods, it is necessary to make adjustments to amounts recorded as Accrued Performance Allocations to reflect either (a) positive performance resulting in an increase in the Accrued Performance Allocation to the general partner or (b) negative performance that would cause the amount due to Blackstone to be less than the amount previously recognized as revenue, resulting in a negative adjustment to the Accrued Performance Allocation to the general partner. In each scenario, it is necessary to calculate the Accrued Performance Allocation on cumulative results compared to the Accrued Performance Allocation recorded to date and make the required positive or negative adjustments. Blackstone ceases to record negative Performance Allocations once previously Accrued Performance Allocations for such fund have been fully reversed. Blackstone is not obligated to pay guaranteed returns or hurdles, and therefore, cannot have negative Performance Allocations over the life of a fund. Accrued Performance Allocations as of the reporting date are reflected in Investments in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition.
Performance Allocations in carry fund structures are realized when an underlying investment is profitably disposed of and the fund’s cumulative returns are in excess of the preferred return or, in limited instances, after certain thresholds for return of capital are met. Performance Allocations in carry fund structures are subject to clawback to the extent that the Performance Allocation received to date exceeds the amount due to Blackstone based on cumulative results. As such, the accrual for potential repayment of previously received Performance Allocations, which is a component of Due to Affiliates, represents all amounts previously distributed to Blackstone Holdings and non-controlling interest holders that would need to be repaid to the Blackstone carry funds if the Blackstone carry funds were to be liquidated based on the current fair value of the underlying funds’ investments as of the reporting date. The actual clawback liability, however, generally does not become realized until the end of a fund’s life except for certain funds, which may have an interim clawback liability. Performance Allocations in open-ended structures are realized based on the stated time period in the agreements and are generally not subject to clawback once paid.
Principal Investments include the unrealized and realized gains and losses on Blackstone’s principal investments, including its investments in Blackstone Funds that are not consolidated and receive pro-rata allocations, its equity method investments, and other principal investments. Income (Loss) on Principal Investments is realized when Blackstone redeems all or a portion of its investment or when Blackstone receives cash income, such as dividends or distributions. Unrealized Income (Loss) on Principal Investments results from changes in the fair value of the underlying investment as well as the reversal of unrealized gain (loss) at the time an investment is realized.
Interest and Dividend Revenue
— Interest and Dividend Revenue comprises primarily interest and dividend income earned on principal investments not accounted for under the equity method held by Blackstone.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments
GAAP establishes a hierarchical disclosure framework which prioritizes and ranks the level of market price observability used in measuring financial instruments at fair value. Market price observability is affected by a number of factors, including the type of financial instrument, the characteristics specific to the financial instrument and the state of the marketplace, including the existence and transparency of transactions between market participants. Financial instruments with readily available quoted prices in active markets generally will have a higher degree of market price observability and a lesser degree of judgment used in measuring fair value.
Financial instruments measured and reported at fair value are classified and disclosed based on the observability of inputs used in the determination of fair values, as follows:
In certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, the determination of which category within the fair value hierarchy is appropriate for any given financial instrument is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Blackstone’s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the financial instrument.
Level II Valuation Techniques
Financial instruments classified within Level II of the fair value hierarchy comprise debt instr
ume
nts, debt securities sold, not yet purchased and certain equity securities and derivative instruments valued using observable inputs.

The valuation techniques used to value financial instruments classified within Level II of the fair value hierarchy are as follows:
Level III Valuation Techniques
In the absence of observable market prices, Blackstone values its investments using valuation methodologies applied on a consistent basis. For some investments little market activity may exist; management’s determination of fair value is then based on the best information available in the circumstances, and may incorporate management’s own assumptions and involves a significant degree of judgment, taking into consideration a combination of internal and external factors, including the appropriate risk adjustments for non-performance and liquidity risks. Investments for which market prices are not observable include private investments in the equity of operating companies, real estate properties and investments in non-consolidated CLO vehicles.
Real Estate Investments
– The fair values of real estate investments are determined by considering projected operating cash flows, sales of comparable assets, if any, and replacement costs, among other measures and considerations. The methods used to estimate the fair value of real estate investments include the discounted cash flow method, where value is calculated by discounting the estimated cash flows and the estimated terminal value of the subject investment by the assumed buyer’s weighted-average cost of capital. A terminal value is derived by reference to an exit multiple, such as for estimates of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”), or a capitalization rate, such as for estimates of net operating income (“NOI”). Valuations may also be derived by the performance multiple or market approach, by reference to observable valuation measures for comparable companies or assets (for example, dividing NOI by a relevant capitalization rate observed for comparable companies or transactions), adjusted by management for differences between the investment and the referenced comparables.
Private Equity Investments
– The fair values of private equity investments are determined by reference to projected net earnings, EBITDA, public market or private transactions, valuations for comparable companies and other measures which, in many cases, are based on unaudited information at the time received. The methods used to estimate the fair value of private equity investments include the discounted cash flow method. Where a discounted cash flow method is used, a terminal value is derived by reference to EBITDA or price/earnings exit multiples. Valuations may also be derived by reference to observable valuation measures for comparable companies or transactions (for example, multiplying a key performance metric of the investee company, such as EBITDA, by a relevant valuation multiple observed in the range of comparable companies or transactions), adjusted by management for differences between the investment and the referenced comparables, and in some instances by reference to option pricing models or other similar methods.

(All Dollars are in Thousands, Except Share and Per Share Data, Except Where Noted)
Credit-Focused Investments
– The fair values of credit-focused investments are generally determined on the basis of prices between market participants provided by reputable dealers or pricing services. For credit-focused investments that are not publicly traded or whose market prices are not readily available, Blackstone may utilize other valuation techniques, including the discounted cash flow method or a market approach. The discounted cash flow method projects the expected cash flows of the debt instrument based on contractual terms, and discounts such cash flows back to the valuation date using a market-based yield. The market-based yield is generally estimated using yields of publicly traded debt instruments issued by companies operating in similar industries as the subject investment or based on changes in credit spreads of a broader benchmark index applicable to a subject investment.
The market approach is generally used to determine the enterprise value of the issuer of a credit investment, and considers valuation multiples of comparable companies or transactions. The resulting enterprise value will dictate whether or not such credit investment has adequate enterprise value coverage. In cases of distressed credit instruments, the market approach may be used to estimate a recovery value in the event of a restructuring.
Investments, at Fair Value
Generally, the Blackstone Funds are accounted for as investment companies in accordance with the GAAP guidance on investment companies, and under the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Audit and Accounting Guide,
Investment Companies
, and reflect their investments, including majority-owned and controlled investments, at fair value. Such consolidated funds’ investments are reflected in Investments on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value reflected as a component of Net Gains (Losses) from Fund Investment Activities in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. Fair value is the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability, in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date, at current market conditions (i.e., the exit price).
Certain principal investments are presented at fair value with unrealized appreciation or dep
re
ciation and realized gains and losses recognized in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations within Investment Income (Loss).
For certain instruments, Blackstone has elected the fair value option. Such election is irrevocable and is applied on an investment by investment basis at initial recognition or other eligible election dates. Blackstone has applied the fair value option for certain loans and receivables, unfunded loan commitments and certain investments that otherwise would not have been carried at fair value with gains and losses recorded in net income. The methodology for measuring the fair value of such investments is consistent with the methodology applied to private equity, real estate and credit-focused investments. Changes in the fair value of such instruments are recognized in Investment Income (Loss) in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. Interest income on interest bearing loans and receivables and debt securities on which the fair value option has been elected is based on stated coupon rates adjusted for the accretion of purchase discounts and the amortization of purchase premiums. This interest income is recorded within Interest and Dividend Revenue.
Blackstone has elected the fair value option for the assets of consolidated CLO vehicles. As permitted under GAAP, Blackstone measures notes issued by consolidated CLO vehicles as (a) the sum of the fair value of the consolidated CLO assets and the carrying value of any non-financial assets held temporarily, less (b) the sum of the fair value of any beneficial interests retained by Blackstone (other than those that represent compensation for services) and Blackstone’s carrying value of any beneficial interests that represent compensation for services. As a result of this measurement alternative, there is no attribution of amounts to Non-Controlling Interests for consolidated CLO vehicles. Assets of the consolidated CLOs are presented within Investments within the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition and notes payable within Loans Payable for the
19

amounts due to unaffiliated third parties. Changes in the fair value of consolidated CLO assets and liabilities and related interest, dividend and other income are presented within Net Gains (Losses) from Fund Investment Activities. Expenses of consolidated CLO vehicles are presented in Fund Expenses.
Blackstone has elected the fair value option for certain proprietary investments that would otherwise have been accounted for using the equity method of accounting. The fair value of such investments is based on quoted prices in an active market, quoted prices that are published on a regular basis and are the basis for current transactions or using the discounted cash flow method. Changes in fair value are recognized in Investment Income (Loss) in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.
Further disclosure on instruments for which the fair value option has been elected is presented in Note 6. “Fair Value Option.”
Blackstone may elect to measure certain proprietary investments in equity securities without readily determinable fair values under the measurement alternative, which reflects cost less impairment, with adjustments in value resulting from observable price changes arising from orderly transactions of the same or a similar security from the same issuer. If the measurement alternative election is not made, the equity security is measured at fair value. The measurement alternative election is made on an instrument by instrument basis. The election is reassessed each reporting period to determine whether investments under the measurement alternative have readily determinable fair values, in which case they would no longer be eligible for this election.
Certain investments of Blackstone and the consolidated Blackstone funds are valued at NAV per share pursuant to the practical expedient. In limited circumstances, Blackstone may determine, based on its own due diligence and investment procedures, that NAV per share does not represent fair value. In such circumstances, Blackstone will estimate the fair value in good faith and in a manner that it reasonably chooses, in accordance with the requirements of GAAP.
The terms of the investee’s investment generally provide for minimum holding periods or lock-ups, the institution of gates on redemptions or the suspension of redemptions or an ability to side pocket investments, at the discretion of the investee’s fund manager, and as a result, investments may not be redeemable at, or within three months of, the reporting date.
Security and loan transactions are recorded on a trade date basis.
Equity Method Investments
Investments in which Blackstone is deemed to exert significant influence, but not control, are accounted for using the equity method of accounting except in cases where the fair value option has been elected. Blackstone has significant influence over all Blackstone Funds in which it invests but does not consolidate. Therefore, its investments in such Blackstone Funds, which generally include both a proportionate and disproportionate allocation of the profits and losses (as is the case with funds that include a Performance Allocation), are accounted for under the equity method. Under the equity method of accounting, Blackstone’s share of earnings (losses) from equity method inves
t
ments is included in Investment Income (Loss) in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.
In cases where Blackstone’s equity method investments provide for a disproportionate allocation of the profits and losses (as is the case with funds that include a Performance Allocation), Blackstone’s share of earnings (losses) from equity method investments is determined using a balance sheet approach referred to as the hypothetical liquidation at book value (“HLBV”) method. Under the HLBV method, at the end of each reporting period, Blackstone calculates the Accrued Performance Allocations that would be due to Blackstone for each fund pursuant to the fund agreements as if the fair value of the underlying investments were realized as of such date,
20
Table of Contents
Blackstone Inc.
Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) - Continued
(All Dollars are in Thousands, Except Share and Per Share Data, Except Where Noted)
irrespective of whether such amounts have been realized. As the fair value of underlying investments varies between reporting periods, it is necessary to make adjustments to amounts recorded as Accrued Performance Allocations to reflect either (a) positive performance resulting in an increase in the Accrued Performance Allocation to the general partner, or (b) negative performance that would cause the amount due to Blackstone to be less than the amount previously recognized as revenue, resulting in a negative adjustment to the Accrued Performance Allocation to the general partner. In each scenario, it is necessary to calculate the Accrued Performance Allocation on cumulative results compared to the Accrued Performance Allocation recorded to date and make the required positive or negative adjustments. Blackstone ceases to record negative Performance Allocations once previously Accrued Performance Allocations for such fund have been fully reversed. Blackstone is not obligated to pay guaranteed returns or hurdles, and therefore, cannot have negative Performance Allocations over the life of a fund. The carrying amounts of equity method investments are reflected in Investments in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition.
Strategic Partners’ results presented in Blackstone’s condensed consolidated financial statements are reported on a three-month lag from Strategic Partners’ fund financial statements, which report the performance of underlying investments generally on a same quarter basis, if available. Therefore, Strategic Partners’ results presented herein do not reflect the impact of economic and market activity in the current quarter. Current quarter market activity of Strategic Partners’ underlying investments is expected to affect Blackstone’s reported results in upcoming periods.
Compensation and Benefits
Compensation and Benefits
—
Compensation
— Compensation consists of (a) salary and bonus, and benefits paid and payable to employees and senior managing directors and (b) equity-based compensation associated with the grants of equity-based awards to employees and senior managing directors. Compensation cost relating to the issuance of equity-based awards to senior managing directors and employees is measured at fair value at the grant date, and expensed over the vesting period on a straight-line basis, taking into consideration expected forfeitures, except in the case of (a) equity-based awards that do not require future service, which are expensed immediately, and (b) certain awards to recipients that meet criteria making them eligible for retirement (allowing such recipient to keep a percentage of those awards upon departure from Blackstone after becoming eligible for retirement), for which the expense for the portion of the award that would be retained in the event of retirement is either expensed immediately or amortized to the retirement date. Cash settled equity-based awards and awards settled in a variable number of shares are classified as liabilities and are remeasured at the end of each reporting period.
Compensation and Benefits — Incentive Fee Compensation —
Incentive Fee Compensation consists of compensation paid based on Incentive Fees.
Compensation and Benefits — Performance Allocations Compensation —
Performance Allocation Compensation consists of compensation paid based on Performance Allocations (which may be distributed in cash or in-kind). Such compensation expense is subject to both positive and negative adjustments. Performance Allocations Compensation is generally based on the performance of individual investments held by a fund rather than on a fund by fund basis. These amounts may also include allocations of investment income from Blackstone’s principal investments, to senior managing directors and employees participating in certain profit sharing initiatives.
Non-Controlling Interests in Consolidated Entities
Non-Controlling Interests in Consolidated Entities represent the component of Equity in general partner entities and consolidated Blackstone funds held by third-party investors and employees. The percentage interests in consolidated Blackstone funds held by third parties and employees is adjusted for general partner allocations and by subscriptions and redemptions in funds of hedge funds and certain credit-focused funds which occur during
21
Table of Contents
Blackstone Inc.
Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) - Continued
(All Dollars are in Thousands, Except Share and Per Share Data, Except Where Noted)
the reporting period. Income (Loss) and other comprehensive income, if applicable, arising from the respective entities is allocated to non-controlling interests in consolidated entities based on the relative ownership interests of third-party investors and employees after considering any contractual arrangements that govern the allocation of income (loss) such as fees allocable to Blackstone Inc.
Redeemable Non-Controlling Interests in Consolidated Entities
Investors in certain consolidated vehicles may be granted redemption rights that allow for quarterly or monthly redemption, as outlined in the relevant governing documents. Such redemption rights may be subject to certain limitations, including limits on the aggregate amount of interests that may be redeemed in a given period, may only allow for redemption following the expiration of a specified period of time, or may be withdrawn subject to a redemption fee during the period when capital may not be withdrawn. As a result, amounts relating to third-party interests in such consolidated vehicles are presented as Redeemable Non-Controlling Interests in Consolidated Entities within the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. When redeemable amounts become legally payable to investors, they are classified as a liability and included in Accounts Payable, Accrued Expenses and Other Liabilities in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. For all consolidated vehicles in which redemption rights have not been granted, non-controlling interests are presented within Equity in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition as Non-Controlling Interests in Consolidated Entities.
Non-Controlling Interests in Blackstone Holdings
Non-Controlling Interests in Blackstone Holdings represent the component of Equity in the consolidated Blackstone Holdings Partnerships held by Blackstone personnel and others who are limited partners of the Blackstone Holdings Partnerships.
Certain costs and expenses are borne directly by the Holdings Partnerships. Income (Loss), excluding those costs directly borne by and attributable to the Holdings Partnerships, is attributable to Non-Controlling Interests in Blackstone Holdings. This residual attribution is based on the year to date average percentage of Blackstone Holdings Partnership Units and unvested participating Holdings Partnership Units held by Blackstone personnel and others who are limited partners of the Blackstone Holdings Partnerships. Unvested participating Holdings Partnership Units are excluded from the attribution in periods of loss as they are not contractually obli
ga
ted to share in losses of the Holdings Partnerships.
Income Taxes
Provision for Income Taxes
Income taxes are provided for using the asset and liability method under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, resulting in all pretax amounts being appropriately tax effected in the period, irrespective of which tax return year items will be reflected. Blackstone reports interest expense and tax penalties related to income tax matters in provision for income taxes.
Deferred Income Taxes
Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities. These temporary differences result in taxable or deductible amounts in future years and are measured using the tax rates and laws that will be in effect when such differences are expected to reverse. Valuation allowances are established to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. Deferred tax assets are separately stated, and deferred tax liabilities are included in Accounts Payable, Accrued Expenses, and Other Liabilities in the condensed consolidated financial statements.

Unrecognized Tax Benefits
Blackstone recognizes tax positions in the condensed consolidated financial statements when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on examination by the relevant taxing authority based on the technical merits of the position. A position that meets this standard is measured at the largest amount of benefit that will more likely than not be realized on settlement. A liability is established for differences between positions taken in the return and amounts recognized in the condensed consolidated financial statements. Accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are reported on the related liability line in the condensed consolidated financial statements.
Net Income (Loss) Per Share of Common Stock
Basic Income (Loss) Per Share of Common Stock is calculated by dividing Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Blackstone Inc. by the weighted-average shares of common stock, unvested participating shares of common stock outstanding for the period and vested deferred restricted shares of common stock that have been earned for which issuance of the related shares of common stock is deferred until future periods. Diluted Income (Loss) Per Share of Common Stock reflects the impact of all dilutive securities. Unvested participating shares of common stock are excluded from the computation in periods of loss as they are not contractually obligated to share in losses.
Blackstone applies the treasury stock method to determine the dilutive weighted-average common shares outstanding for certain equity-based compensation awards. Blackstone applies the “if-converted” method to the Blackstone Holdings Partnership Units to determine the dilutive impact, if any, of the exchange right included in the Blackstone Holdings Partnership Units. Blackstone applies the contingently issuable share model to contracts that may require the issuance of shares.
Reverse Repurchase and Repurchase Agreements
Securities purchased under agreements to resell (“reverse repurchase agreements”) and securities sold under agreements to repurchase (“repurchase agreements”), generally comprised of U.S. and non-U.S. government and agency securities, asset backed securities and corporate debt, represent collateralized financing transactions. Such transactions are recorded within Accounts Payable, Accrued Expenses and Other Liabilities in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition at their contractual amounts and include accrued interest. The carrying value of reverse repurchase and repurchase agreements approximates fair value.
Blackstone manages credit exposure arising from reverse repurchase agreements and repurchase agreements by, in appropriate circumstances, entering into master netting agreements and collateral arrangements with counterparties that provide Blackstone, in the event of a counterparty default, the right to liquidate collateral and the right to offset a counterparty’s rights and obligations.
Blackstone takes possession of securities purchased under reverse repurchase agreements and is permitted to repledge, deliver or otherwise use such securities. Blackstone also pledges its financial instruments to counterparties to collateralize repurchase agreements. Financial instruments pledged that can be repledged, delivered or otherwise used by the counterparty are recorded in Investments in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. Additional disclosures relating to repurchase agreements are included in Note 9. “Repurchase Agreements.”

Blackstone does not offset assets and liabilities relating to reverse repurchase agreements and repurchase agreements in its Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. Additional disclosures relating to offsetting are discussed in Note 10. “Offsetting of Assets and Liabilities.”
Securities Sold, Not Yet Purchased
Securities Sold, Not Yet Purchased consist of equity and debt securities that Blackstone has borrowed and sold. Blackstone is required to “cover” its short sale in the future by purchasing the security at prevailing market prices and delivering it to the counterparty from which it borrowed the security. Blackstone is exposed to loss in the event that the price at which a security may have to be purchased to cover a short sale exceeds the price at which the borrowed security was sold short.
Securities Sold, Not Yet Purchased are recorded at fair value within Accounts Payable, Accrued Expenses and Other Liabilities in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition.
Derivative Instruments
Blackstone recognizes all derivatives as assets or liabilities on its Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition at fair value. On the date Blackstone enters into a derivative contract, it designates and documents each derivative contract as one of the following: (a) a hedge of a recognized asset or liability (“fair value hedge”), (b) a hedge of a forecasted transaction or of the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability (“cash flow hedge”), (c) a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation, or (d) a derivative instrument not designated as a hedging instrument (“freestanding derivative”).
For freestanding derivative contracts, Blackstone presents changes in fair value in current period earnings. Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments held by consolidated Blackstone funds are reflected in Net Gains (Losses) from Fund Investment Activities or, where derivative instruments are held by Blackstone, within Investment Income (Loss) in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. The fair value of freestanding derivative assets of the consolidated Blackstone funds are recorded within Investments, the fair value of freestanding derivative assets that are not part of the consolidated Blackstone funds are recorded within Other Assets and the fair value of freestanding derivative liabilities are recorded within Accounts Payable, Accrued Expenses and Other Liabilities in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition.
Blackstone has elected to not offset derivative assets and liabilities or financial assets in its Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition, including cash, that may be received or paid as part of collateral arrangements, even when an enforceable master netting agreement is in place that provides Blackstone, in the event of counterparty default, the right to liquidate collateral and the right to offset a counterparty’s rights and obligations.
Blackstone’s other disclosures regarding derivative financial instruments are discussed in Note 5. “Derivative Financial Instruments.”
Blackstone’s disclosures regarding offsetting are discussed in Note 10. “Offsetting of Assets and Liabilities.”
Affiliates
Blackstone considers its Founder, senior managing directors, employees, the Blackstone Funds and the Portfolio Companies to be affiliates.
Dividends
Dividends are reflected in the condensed consolidated financial statements when declared.

Recent Accounting Developments
In December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued amended guidance addressing income tax disclosures. The guidance requires greater disaggregation of information in the effective income tax rate reconciliation and income taxes paid disclosure. The guidance is effective for Blackstone’s annual period ending December 31, 2025.
Intangible Assets, Net consists of the following:
Amortization expense associated with Blackstone’s intangible assets was $
9.0
million for the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024.
Amortization of Intangible Assets held at March 31, 2025 is expected to be $
35.9
million, $
35.7
million, $
34.6
million, $
17.8
million and $
16.6
million for each of the years ending December 31, 2025, 2026, 2027, 2028 and 2029, respectively. Blackstone’s Intangible Assets as of March 31, 2025 are expected to amortize over a weighted-average period of
5.1
years.
Investments consist of the following:
Blackstone’s share of Investments of Consolidated Blackstone Funds totaled $
559.8
million and $
439.7
million at March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively.
Where appropriate, the accounting for Blackstone’s investments incorporates the changes in fair value of those investments as determined under GAAP. The significant inputs and assumptions required to determine the change in fair value of the Investments of Consolidated Blackstone Funds, Corporate Treasury Investments and Other Investments are discussed in more detail in Note 7. “Fair Value Measurements of Financial Instruments.”

Investments of Consolidated Blackstone Funds
The following table presents the Realized and Net Change in Unrealized Gains (Losses) on investments held by the consolidated Blackstone funds and a reconciliation to Other Income (Loss) – Net Gains (Losses) from Fund Investment Activities in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations:
Equity Method Investments
Blackstone’s equity method investments include Partnership Investments, which represent the pro-rata investments, and any associated Accrued Performance Allocations, in Blackstone Funds, excluding any equity method investments for which the fair value option has been elected. Blackstone evaluates each of its equity method investments, excluding Accrued Performance Allocations, to determine if any were significant as defined by guidance from the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. As of and for the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, no individual equity method investment held by Blackstone met the significance criteria.
Partnership Investments
Blackstone recognized net gains related to its Partnership Investments accounted for under the equity method of $
140.5
million and $
156.0
million for the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively.
Accrued Performance Allocations
Accrued Performance Allocations to Blackstone were as follows:

Corporate Treasury Investments
The portion of corporate treasury investments included in Investments represents Blackstone’s investments into primarily fixed income securities, mutual fund interests, and other fund interests. These strategies are managed by a combination of Blackstone personnel and third-party advisors.
The following table presents the Realized and Net Change in Unrealized Gains (Losses) on these investments:
Other Investments
Other Investments consist of equity method investments where Blackstone has elected the fair value option and other proprietary investment securities held by Blackstone, including equity securities carried at fair value, equity investments without readily determinable fair values, and senior secured and subordinated notes in non-consolidated CLO vehicles. Equity investments without a readily determinable fair value had a carrying value of $
420.1
million as of March 31, 2025. In the period of acquisition and upon remeasurement in connection with an observable transaction, such investments are reported at fair value. See Note 7. “Fair Value Measurements of Financial Instruments” for additional detail.
The following table presents Blackstone’s Realized and Net Change in Unrealized Gains (Losses) in Other Investments:
Blackstone and the consolidated Blackstone funds enter into derivative contracts in the normal course of business to achieve certain risk management objectives and for general investment and business purposes. Blackstone may enter into derivative contracts in order to hedge its interest rate risk exposure against the effects of interest rate changes. Additionally, Blackstone may also enter into derivative contracts in order to hedge its foreign currency risk exposure against the effects of a portion of its non-U.S. dollar denominated currency net investments. As a result of the use of derivative contracts, Blackstone and the consolidated Blackstone funds are exposed to the risk that counterparties will fail to fulfill their contractual obligations. To mitigate such counterparty risk, Blackstone and the consolidated Blackstone funds enter into contracts with certain major financial institutions, all of which have investment grade ratings. Counterparty credit risk is evaluated in determining the fair value of derivative instruments.
Freestanding Derivatives
Freestanding derivatives are instruments that Blackstone and certain of the consolidated Blackstone funds have entered into as part of their overall risk management and investment strategies. These derivative contracts are not designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes. Such contracts may include interest rate swaps, foreign exchange contracts, equity swaps, options, futures and other derivative contracts.

Equity Securities Subject to Sale Restrictions
Within Investments of Consolidated Blackstone Funds and Other Investments, Blackstone held equity securities subject to sale restrictions with a fair value of $
660.0
million as of March 31, 2025. The nature of such restrictions are contractual or legal in nature and deemed an attribute of the holder rather than the investment. Contractual restrictions include certain phased restrictions on sale or transfer, underwriter lock-ups and sale or transfer restrictions applicable to certain Investments of Consolidated Blackstone Funds pledged as collateral. Restrictions will generally lapse over time or after a predetermined date and the weighted-average remaining duration of such restrictions is
2
years. Level III equity securities included in Investments of Consolidated Blackstone Funds are illiquid and privately negotiated in nature and may also be subject to contractual sale or transfer restrictions including those pursuant to their respective governing or similar agreements. Investments within Other Investments subject to restrictions on sale or transfer as a result of pledge arrangements are discussed in Note 16. “Commitments and Contingencies — Contingencies — Strategic Ventures.”

Pursuant to GAAP consolidation guidance, Blackstone consolidates certain VIEs for which it is the primary beneficiary either directly or indirectly, through a consolidated entity or affiliate. VIEs include certain private equity, real estate, credit-focused or funds of hedge funds entities and CLO vehicles. The purpose of such VIEs is to provide strategy specific investment opportunities for investors in exchange for management and performance-based fees. The investment strategies of the Blackstone Funds differ by product; however, the fundamental risks of the Blackstone Funds are similar, including loss of invested capital and loss of management fees and performance-based fees. In Blackstone’s role as general partner, collateral manager or investment adviser, it generally considers itself the sponsor of the applicable Blackstone Fund. Blackstone does not provide performance guarantees and has no other financial obligation to provide funding to consolidated VIEs other than its own capital commitments.
The assets of consolidated variable interest entities may only be used to settle obligations of these entities. In addition, there is no recourse to Blackstone for the consolidated VIEs’ liabilities.
Blackstone holds variable interests in certain VIEs which are not consolidated as it is determined that Blackstone is not the primary beneficiary. Blackstone’s involvement with such entities is in the form of direct and indirect equity interests and fee arrangements. The maximum exposure to loss represents the loss of assets recognized by Blackstone relating to non-consolidated VIEs and any clawback obligation relating to previously distributed Performance Allocations.
Blackstone’s maximum exposure to loss relating to non-consolidated VIEs were as follows:
As of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, Blackstone had pledged securities with a carrying value of $
42.6
million and $
6.8
million, respectively.

Freestanding Derivative assets are included in Other Assets in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition.
The following table presents the components of Other Assets:
Notional Pooling Arrangements
Blackstone has notional cash pooling arrangements with financial institutions for cash management purposes. These arrangements allow for cash withdrawals based upon aggregate cash balances on deposit at the same financial institution. Cash withdrawals cannot exceed aggregate cash balances on deposit. The net balance of cash on deposit and overdrafts is used as a basis for calculating net interest expense or income. As of March 31, 2025, the aggregate cash balance on deposit relating to the cash pooling arrangements was $
995.1
million, which was offset and reported net of the accompanying overdraft of $
995.1
million.
The following table presents each of Blackstone’s borrowings as of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, as well as their carrying value and fair value. The borrowings are included in Loans Payable within the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. Each of the Senior Notes were issued at a discount through Blackstone Holdings Finance Co. L.L.C. or Blackstone Reg Finance Co. L.L.C., as applicable, both indirect subsidiaries of Blackstone. The Senior Notes accrue interest from the issue date thereof and pay interest in arrears on a semi-annual basis or annual basis. The Secured Borrowings were issued at par, accrue interest from the issue date thereof and pay interest in arrears on a quarterly basis. CLO Notes Payable pay interest in arrears on a quarterly basis.

consist of a maximum net leverage ratio and a requirement to keep a minimum amount of fee-earning assets under management, each tested quarterly. As of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, Blackstone had outstanding but undrawn letters of credit against the Revolving Credit Facility of $
40.4
million and $
38.9
million, respectively. The amount Blackstone can draw from the Credit Facility is reduced by the undrawn letters of credit.
Scheduled principal payments for borrowings as of March 31, 2025 were as follows:
Blackstone’s net deferred tax assets relate primarily to basis differences resulting from a step-up in tax basis of certain assets at the time of its conversion to a corporation, as well as ongoing exchanges of units for common shares by founders and partners. As of March 31, 2025, Blackstone had a valuation allowance of $
22.3
million recorded against deferred tax assets.
Blackstone is subject to examination by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other taxing authorities where Blackstone has significant business operations such as the United Kingdom, and various state and local jurisdictions such as New York State and New York City. The tax years under examination vary by jurisdiction. Blackstone does not expect the completion of these audits to have a material impact on its financial condition, but it may be material to operating results for a particular period, depending on the operating results for that period. Blackstone believes the liability established for unrecognized tax benefits is adequate in relation to the potential for additional assessments. It is reasonably possible that changes in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits may occur within the next twelve months; however, it is not possible to reasonably estimate the expected change to the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits and the impact on Blackstone’s effective tax rate over the next twelve months.

Earnings Per Share
Basic and diluted net income per share of common stock for the three months ended March 31, 2025 and March 31, 2024 was calculated as follows:
In computing the dilutive effect that the exchange of Blackstone Holdings Partnership Units would have on Net Income Per Share of Common Stock, Blackstone considered that net income available to holders of shares of common stock would increase due to the elimination of non-controlling interests in Blackstone Holdings, inclusive of any tax impact. The hypothetical conversion may be dilutive to the extent there is activity at the Blackstone Inc. level that has not previously been attributed to the non-controlling interests or if there is a change in tax rate as a result of a hypothetical conversion.
The following table summarizes the anti-dilutive securities for the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024:

Share Repurchase Program
On July 16, 2024, Blackstone’s board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $
2.0
billion of common stock and Blackstone Holdings Partnership Units. This authorization replaced Blackstone’s prior $2.0 billion repurchase authorization. Under the repurchase program, repurchases may be made from time to time in open market transactions, in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. The timing and the actual numbers repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including legal requirements, price and economic and market conditions. The repurchase program may be changed, suspended or discontinued at any time and does not have a specified expiration date.
During the three months ended March 31, 2025, Blackstone repurchased
0.2
million shares of common stock at a total cost of $
31.0
million. During the three months ended March 31, 2024, Blackstone repurchased
0.7
million shares of common stock at a total cost of $
88.4
million. As of March 31, 2025, the amount remaining available for repurchases under the program was $
1.8
billion.
Shares Eligible for Dividends and Distributions
As of March 31, 2025, the total shares of common stock and Blackstone Holdings Partnership Units entitled to participate in dividends and distributions were as follows:
Blackstone has granted equity-based compensation awards to Blackstone’s senior managing directors, non-partner professionals, non-professionals and selected external advisers under Blackstone’s Amended and Restated 2007 Equity Incentive Plan (the “Equity Plan”). The Equity Plan allows for the granting of options, share appreciation rights or other share-based awards (shares, restricted shares, restricted shares of common stock, deferred restricted shares of common stock, phantom restricted shares of common stock or other share-based awards based in whole or in part on the fair value of shares of common stock or Blackstone Holdings Partnership Units) which may contain certain service or performance requirements. As of January 1, 2025, Blackstone had the ability to grant
174,967,230
shares under the Equity Plan.
For the three months ended March 31, 2025 and March 31, 2024, Blackstone recorded compensation expense of $
471.1
million and $
320.7
million, respectively, in relation to its equity-based awards with corresponding tax benefits of $
64.0
million and $
65.3
million, respectively.
As of March 31, 2025, there was $
2.9
billion of estimated unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested awards, including compensation with performance conditions where it is probable that the performance condition will be met. This cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of
3.6
years.
Total vested and unvested outstanding shares, including common stock, Blackstone Holdings Partnership Units and deferred restricted shares of common stock, were
1,221,506,384
as of March 31, 2025. Total outstanding phantom shares were
77,844
as of March 31, 2025.

Interests of the Founder, Senior Managing Directors, Employees and Other Related Parties
The Founder, senior managing directors, employees and certain other related parties invest on a discretionary basis in the consolidated Blackstone funds both directly and through consolidated entities. These investments generally are subject to preferential management fee and performance allocation or incentive fee arrangements. As of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, such investments aggregated $
2.1
billion and $
2.0
billion, respectively. Their share of the Net Income Attributable to Redeemable Non-Controlling and Non-Controlling Interests in Consolidated Entities aggregated to $
47.5
million and $
31.9
million for the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively.
Contingent Repayment Guarantee
Blackstone and its personnel who have received Performance Allocation distributions have guaranteed payment on a several basis (subject to a cap) to the carry funds of any clawback obligation with respect to the excess Performance Allocation allocated to the general partners of such funds and indirectly received thereby to the extent that either Blackstone or its personnel fails to fulfill its clawback obligation, if any. The Accrual for Potential Repayment of Previously Received Performance Allocations represents amounts previously paid to Blackstone Holdings and non-controlling interest holders that would need to be repaid to the Blackstone Funds if the carry funds were to be liquidated based on the fair value of their underlying investments as of March 31, 2025. See Note 16. “Commitments and Contingencies — Contingencies — Contingent Obligations (Clawback).”
Tax Receivable Agreements
Blackstone used a portion of the proceeds from the IPO and other sales of shares to purchase interests in the predecessor businesses from the predecessor owners. In addition, holders of Blackstone Holdings Partnership Units may exchange their Blackstone Holdings Partnership Units for shares of Blackstone common stock on a one-for-one basis. The purchase and subsequent exchanges are expected to result in increases in the tax basis of the tangible and intangible assets of Blackstone Holdings and therefore reduce the amount of tax that Blackstone would otherwise be required to pay in the future.
Blackstone has entered into tax receivable agreements with each of the predecessor owners. In addition, others who acquire Blackstone Holdings Partnership Units, including senior managing directors, execute tax receivable agreements. The agreements provide for the payment by Blackstone Inc. to such owners of
85
% of the amount of cash savings, if any, in U.S. federal, state and local income tax that Blackstone Inc. expects to realize as a result of the aforementioned increases in tax basis and of certain other tax benefits related to entering into these tax receivable agreements. For purposes of the tax receivable agreements, cash savings in income tax will be computed by comparing the actual income tax liability of the corporate taxpayers to the amount of such taxes that the corporate taxpayers would have been required to pay had there been no increase to the tax basis of the tangible and intangible assets of Blackstone Holdings as a result of the exchanges and had the corporate taxpayers not entered into the tax receivable agreements.

Assuming no future material changes in the relevant tax law and that the corporate taxpayers earn sufficient taxable income to realize the full tax benefit of the increased amortization of the assets, the expected future payments under the tax receivable agreements (which are taxable to the recipients) will aggregate $
2.0
billion over the next
15
years. The after-tax net present value of these estimated payments totals $
611.9
million assuming a
15
% discount rate and using Blackstone’s most recent projections relating to the estimated timing of the benefit to be received. Future payments under the tax receivable agreements in respect of subsequent exchanges would be in addition to these amounts. The payments under the tax receivable agreements are not conditioned upon continued ownership of Blackstone equity interests by the pre-IPO owners and the others mentioned above.
Amounts related to the deferred tax asset resulting from the increase in tax basis from the exchange of Blackstone Holdings Partnership Units to shares of Blackstone common stock, the resulting remeasurement of net deferred tax assets at the Blackstone ownership percentage at the balance sheet date, the due to affiliates for the future payments resulting from the tax receivable agreements and resulting adjustment to partners’ capital are included as Deferred Tax Asset Effects from Equity Transactions in the Supplemental Disclosure of Non-Cash Investing and Financing Activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.
Other
Blackstone does business with and on behalf of some of its Portfolio Companies; all such arrangements are on a negotiated basis.
Additionally, please see Note 16. “Commitments and Contingencies — Contingencies — Guarantees” for information regarding guarantees provided to a lending institution for certain loans held by employees.
Commitments
Investment Commitments
Blackstone had $
5.0
billion of investment commitments as of March 31, 2025 representing general partner capital funding commitments to the Blackstone Funds, limited partner capital funding to other funds and Blackstone principal investment commitments, including loan commitments. The consolidated Blackstone funds had signed investment commitments of $
207.7
million as of March 31, 2025, which includes $
44.0
million of signed investment commitments for portfolio company acquisitions in the process of closing.
Contingencies
Guarantees
Certain of Blackstone’s consolidated real estate funds guarantee payments to third parties in connection with the ongoing business activities and/or acquisitions of their Portfolio Companies. There is no direct recourse to Blackstone to fulfill such obligations. To the extent that underlying funds are required to fulfill guarantee obligations, Blackstone’s invested capital in such funds is at risk. Total investments at risk in respect of guarantees extended by consolidated real estate funds was $
26.8
million as of March 31, 2025.
The Blackstone Holdings Partnerships provided guarantees to a lending institution for certain loans held by employees either for investment in Blackstone Funds or for members’ capital contributions to Blackstone Europe LLP. The amount guaranteed as of March 31, 2025 was $
93.0
million.

Strategic Ventures
In December 2022 and January 2023, Blackstone entered into long-term strategic ventures (“UC strategic ventures”) with the Regents of the University of California (“UC Investments”), an institutional investor that subscribed for $
4.5
billion of Blackstone Real Estate Income Trust, Inc. (“BREIT”) Class I shares during the three months ended March 31, 2023. The UC strategic ventures provide a waterfall structure with UC Investments receiving an
11.25
% target annualized net return on its $
4.5
billion investment in BREIT shares and upside from its investment. This target return, while not guaranteed, is supported by a pledge by Blackstone of $
1.1
billion of its holdings in BREIT as of the subscription dates, including any appreciation or dividends received by Blackstone in respect thereof. Pursuant to the UC strategic ventures, Blackstone is entitled to receive an incremental
5
% cash payment from UC Investments on any returns received in excess of the target return.
During the three months ended March 31, 2025, Blackstone entered into a similar long-term strategic venture with an institutional investor as part of the investor’s investment of
€
1.0
billion in a vehicle managed in the Real Estate segment. The long-term strategic venture provides for a target return of
9.25
% supported by a pledge by Blackstone of
€
200
million of its holdings in a related vehicle.
For each such arrangement, an asset or liability is recognized based on fair value with the maximum potential future obligation in respect of the target return capped at the fair value of the assets pledged by Blackstone in connection with the respective arrangement. As of March 31, 2025, across both arrangements, the fair value of the total assets pledged was $
1.4
billion and the total liability recognized was $
1.0
billion.
Litigation
Blackstone may from time to time be involved in litigation and claims incidental to the conduct of its business. Blackstone’s businesses are also subject to extensive regulation, which may result in regulatory proceedings against Blackstone.
Blackstone accrues a liability for legal proceedings only when those matters present loss contingencies that are both probable and reasonably estimable. In such cases, there may be an exposure to loss in excess of any amounts accrued. Although there can be no assurance of the outcome of such legal actions, based on information known by management, Blackstone does not have any unaccrued liability related to any current legal proceeding or claim that would individually or in the aggregate materially affect its results of operations, financial position or cash flows.
In December 2017, eight pension plan members of the Kentucky Retirement System (“KRS”) filed a derivative lawsuit on behalf of KRS in Franklin County Circuit Court in Kentucky (the “Mayberry Action”). Plaintiffs alleged breaches of fiduciary duty and other violations of Kentucky law in connection with KRS’s investment in three hedge funds of funds, including a fund managed by Blackstone Alternative Asset Management L.P. (“BLP”). The suit named more than 30 defendants, including, among others, The Blackstone Group L.P. (now Blackstone Inc.); BLP; Stephen A. Schwarzman, as Chairman and CEO of Blackstone; and J. Tomilson Hill, as then-CEO of BLP (collectively, the “Blackstone Defendants”). In July 2020, the Kentucky Supreme Court directed the Circuit Court to dismiss the action for lack of standing.
In July 2020, the Kentucky Attorney General (the “AG”) filed its own action asserting substantially identical claims against largely the same defendants (the “July 2020 Action”). In May 2024, the Court denied the Blackstone Defendants’ and most other defendants’ motions to dismiss the July 2020 Action. In April 2024, the AG amended its complaint, adding breach-of-contract claims against the fund manager defendants. Defendants moved to dismiss this amended complaint in June 2024. Those motions are pending.

In August 2022, KRS was ordered to disclose a 2021 report it commissioned to investigate the investment activities underlying the lawsuit. The report “did not find any violations of fiduciary duty or illegal activity by [BLP],” and quotes communications by KRS staff during the period of the investment recognizing that BLP was exceeding KRS’s returns benchmark, providing KRS with “far fewer negative months than any liquid market comparable,” and that BLP “[h]as killed it.”
In January 2021, certain former plaintiffs in the Mayberry Action filed a separate action (“Taylor I”) against the Blackstone Defendants and other defendants in the Mayberry Action, asserting substantially similar allegations as the AG’s July 2020 action did, but styled as a direct class action. Taylor I was removed to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky and stayed pending the outcome of the AG’s July 2020 action.
In August 2021, a group of KRS members—including those that filed Taylor I—filed an action in Franklin County Circuit Court (“Taylor II”) substantially similar to Taylor I, against the Blackstone Defendants, other defendants named in the Mayberry Action, and other KRS officials. The Court denied most defendants’ motions to dismiss this action in May 2024. The Blackstone Defendants and the other fund manager defendants filed a petition for a writ of prohibition from that denial. On November 12, 2024, the Kentucky Court of Appeals denied defendants’ writ of prohibition, and defendants subsequently appealed to the Kentucky Supreme Court. Taylor II is stayed pending review of this appeal. The Blackstone Defendants also filed a cross-appeal from the denial of the motions to dismiss, which the Kentucky Court of Appeals dismissed on jurisdictional grounds on April 9, 2025.
In April 2021, the AG filed an action (the “Declaratory Judgment Action”) against BLP and the other fund manager defendants from the Mayberry Action in Franklin County Circuit Court, seeking a declaration that certain provisions in the subscription agreements with KRS violate the Kentucky Constitution. In August 2024, the Kentucky Supreme Court granted BLP’s motion for discretionary review of the Circuit Court’s grant of summary judgment to the AG. The appeal is pending.
In July 2021, BLP filed a breach-of-contract action against defendants affiliated with KRS, alleging that the Mayberry Action and the Declaratory Judgment Action breach the parties’ subscription agreements and seeking damages. In February 2024, the Kentucky Supreme Court granted BLP’s motion for discretionary review of the Circuit Court’s dismissal on ripeness grounds. The appeal is fully briefed and pending.
On January 3, 2025,
we and several other defendants
entered into a settlement agreement with KRS and the Commonwealth of Kentucky to, subject to approval by the
Franklin County Circuit Court
and certain requirements, resolve all claims against these defendants in the AG’s actions, resolve BLP’s breach-of-contract claims, and bar all claims against the Blackstone Defendants in
Taylor I and Taylor II
without any admission of wrongdoing. The settlement includes an $
82.5
million cash settlement divided among several defendants, of which our portion is expected to be covered by insurance. On January 8, 2025, the settling parties moved for court approval of the settlement. Taylor II plaintiffs objected and requested, in part, that the court refer their matter to mediation. After mediation did not result in an agreement, the court held an approval hearing for the defendants’ settlement with KRS and the Commonwealth on March 26, 2025. The decision remains pending. Our financial results for the three months ended March 31, 2025 include an accrual for the estimated liability related to this matter.
Contingent Obligations (Clawback)
Performance Allocations are subject to clawback to the extent that the Performance Allocations received to date with respect to a fund exceeds the amount due to Blackstone based on cumulative results of that fund. The actual clawback liability, however, generally does not become realized until the end of a fund’s life except for certain Blackstone funds, which may have an interim clawback liability. The lives of the funds,
including
available contemplated extensions, for which a liability for potential clawback obligations has been recorded for financial

reporting purposes, are currently anticipated to expire at various points through
2036
. Further extensions of such terms may be implemented under given circumstances.
For financial reporting purposes, when applicable, the general partners record a liability for potential clawback obligations to the limited partners of some of the funds due to changes in the unrealized value of a fund’s remaining investments and where the fund’s general partner has previously received Performance Allocation distributions with respect to such fund’s realized investments.
The following table presents the clawback obligations by segment:
During the three months ended March 31, 2025, the Blackstone general partners paid an interim cash clawback obligation of $
2.1
million related to a Private Equity segment fund, of which $
1.1
million was paid by Blackstone Holdings and $
0.9
million by current and former Blackstone personnel.
For Private Equity, Real Estate, and certain Credit & Insurance Funds, a portion of the Performance Allocations paid to current and former Blackstone personnel is held in segregated accounts in the event of a cash clawback obligation. These segregated accounts are not included in the condensed consolidated financial statements of Blackstone, except to the extent a portion of the assets held in the segregated accounts may be allocated to a consolidated Blackstone fund of hedge funds. At March 31, 2025, $
1.1
billion was held in segregated accounts for the purpose of meeting any clawback obligations of current and former personnel if such payments are required.
In the Credit & Insurance segment, payment of Performance Allocations to Blackstone by the majority of the stressed/distressed, mezzanine and credit alpha strategies funds are substantially deferred under the terms of the partnership agreements. This deferral mitigates the need to hold funds in segregated accounts in the event of a cash clawback obligation.
If, at March 31, 2025, all of the investments held by Blackstone’s carry funds were deemed worthless, a possibility that management views as remote, the amount of Performance Allocations subject to potential clawback would be $
7.4
billion, on an
after-tax
basis where applicable, of which Blackstone Holdings is potentially liable for $
6.8
billion if current and former Blackstone personnel default on their share of the liability, a possibility that management also views as remote.
Blackstone conducts its alternative asset management businesses through four segments:
50
Table of Contents
Blackstone Inc.
Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) - Continued
(All Dollars are in Thousands, Except Share and Per Share Data, Except Where Noted)
These business segments are differentiated by their various investment strategies. Each of the segments primarily earns its income from management fees and investment returns on assets under management. Blackstone’s chief operating decision makers are its Chief Executive Officer and Co-Founder and its President and Chief Operating Officer.
Segment Distributable Earnings is Blackstone’s segment profitability measure used to make operating decisions and assess performance across Blackstone’s four segments.
Segment Distributable Earnings represents the net realized earnings of Blackstone’s segments and is the sum of Fee Related Earnings and Net Realizations for each segment. Blackstone’s segments are presented on a basis that deconsolidates Blackstone Funds, eliminates non-controlling ownership interests in Blackstone’s consolidated operating partnerships, removes the amortization of intangible assets and removes Transaction-Related and Non-Recurring Items. Transaction-Related and Non-Recurring Items arise from corporate actions including acquisitions, divestitures, Blackstone’s initial public offering and non-recurring gains, losses, or other charges, if any. They consist primarily of equity-based compensation charges, gains and losses on contingent consideration arrangements, changes in the balance of the tax receivable agreement resulting from a change in tax law or similar event, transaction costs, gains or losses associated with these corporate actions and non-recurring gains, losses or other charges that affect period-to-period comparability and are not reflective of Blackstone’s operational performance.
For segment reporting purposes, Segment Distributable Earnings is presented along with its major components, Fee Related Earnings and Net Realizations. Fee Related Earnings is used to assess Blackstone’s ability to generate profits from revenues that are measured and received on a recurring basis and not subject to future realization events. Net Realizations is the sum of Realized Principal Investment Income and Realized Performance Revenues less Realized Performance Compensation. Performance Allocations and Incentive Fees are presented together and referred to collectively as Performance Revenues or Performance Compensation.

Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with Blackstone Inc.’s condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes included within this Quarterly Report on
Form 10-Q.
In this report, references to “Blackstone,” the “Company,” “we,” “us” or “our” refer to Blackstone Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.
Our Business
Blackstone is the world’s largest alternative asset manager. We generate revenue from fees earned pursuant to contractual arrangements with funds, fund investors and fund portfolio companies (including management, transaction and monitoring fees), and from capital markets services. We also invest in the funds we manage and we are entitled to a pro-rata share of the income of the fund (a “pro-rata allocation”). In addition to a pro-rata allocation, and assuming certain investment returns are achieved, we are entitled to a disproportionate allocation of the income otherwise allocable to the limited partners, commonly referred to as carried interest (“Performance Allocations”). In certain structures, we receive a contractual incentive fee from an investment fund based on achieving certain investment returns (an “Incentive Fee,” and together with Performance Allocations, “Performance Revenues”). The composition of our revenues will vary based on market conditions and the cyclicality of the different businesses in which we operate. Net investment gains and investment income generated by the Blackstone Funds are driven by the performance of the underlying investments as well as overall market conditions. Fair values are affected by changes in the fundamentals of our portfolio companies and other investments, the industries in which they operate, the overall economy and other market conditions.
Our business is organized into four segments:
Real Estate
Our Real Estate business is a global leader in real estate investing and operates as one globally integrated business, with investments across the globe, including in the Americas, Europe and Asia. Our real estate investment teams seek to utilize our global expertise and presence to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns for our investors.

Business Environment
Blackstone’s businesses are materially affected by conditions in the financial markets and economic conditions in the U.S., Europe, Asia and, to a lesser extent, elsewhere in the world.
Global markets experienced significant volatility in the first quarter of 2025, driven by concerns over the imposition of import tariffs by the U.S. and subsequent retaliation by U.S. trade partners, proposed U.S. government spending cutbacks and a weakening U.S. Dollar. The potential implications for an economic slowdown and inflation also fueled volatility. The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield decreased 36 basis points in the first quarter to 4.21% and remained at that level as of April 28, 2025. Meanwhile, three-month SOFR declined 8 basis points in the first quarter, to 4.41%. The U.S. Dollar depreciated against major currencies, including the Pound Sterling, Euro, Canadian Dollar, and Indian Rupee.
Most major equity markets declined in the first quarter. The total return of the S&P 500 index was (4.3)%, with the largest declines in the consumer discretionary and information technology sectors of 13.8% and 12.7%, respectively. The energy sector was an outlier, increasing 10.2% on expectations of tightening supply and ongoing inflationary pressure. Equity market volatility increased significantly, with the CBOE Volatility Index up 28.4%. In credit markets, the Morningstar LSTA US leveraged loan and the Credit Suisse high yield bond indices generated modestly positive returns of 0.5% and 0.7%, respectively. High yield spreads widened by 69 basis points sequentially while year-to-date issuance decreased 10% on a year-over-year basis. The Henry Hub Natural Gas spot price increased 13% to $4.12, while the price of West Texas Intermediate crude oil remained consistent with the prior quarter at $71.48 per barrel.

The U.S. economy slowed in the first quarter, with the Bureau of Economic Analysis’ advance estimate of U.S. real GDP indicating a contraction of 0.3%, down from 2.4% growth in the fourth quarter of 2024. U.S. inflation continued to decelerate, with March CPI of 2.4% down sharply from the prior peak of 9.1% in June 2022 and modestly from 2.9% in December 2024. The Federal Reserve has held the federal funds target range steady at 4.25-4.50% since January. Subsequent to quarter end, there has been significant speculation as to the likelihood of additional interest rate decreases in 2025. In April, the Chair of the Federal Reserve indicated the Federal Reserve’s inclination to wait for greater clarity on the impact of such policy changes. Nevertheless, Federal Funds Futures reflect the market’s assessment of the possibility of multiple interest rate cuts in the second half of 2025.
Wages rose 3.8% year-over-year in March 2025, and retail sales rose 4.6% year-over-year. The unemployment rate held largely steady, with a rate of 4.2% in March 2025 compared to 4.1% in December of 2024. Despite the strength in wages, retail sales and employment, consumer sentiment, as reflected in the University of Michigan survey, fell to 57.9, representing its lowest level since 2022. Capital markets activity levels in the U.S. remained muted. U.S. initial public offering volumes fell 4% year-over-year, and U.S. announced merger and acquisition deal volumes also decreased 4% year-over-year – both at historically depressed levels.
Outside of the U.S., many major central banks have continued to loosen monetary policy. The European Central Bank lowered its deposit facility rate by 50 basis points in the first quarter to 2.5% and further to 2.25% in April. Eurozone inflation slowed to 2.2% year over year in March 2025, down from a peak of 10.6% in October of 2022 and down from 2.4% in December of 2024. The Bank of England also lowered its bank rate by 25 basis points in the first quarter to 4.5%. Inflation in the U.K. slowed to 2.6% year over year in March 2025 compared to a peak of 11.1% in October of 2022, although was up slightly from 2.5% in December of 2024. In contrast, the Bank of Japan further increased its policy rate to 0.50% in January 2025, the highest level since September 2008.
While the U.S. entered 2025 with a healthy economy, the announcement of significant U.S. tariffs on import of physical goods and retaliatory measures by other countries, has led to meaningful and ongoing market volatility. The ultimate outcome of global trade policy negotiations is unclear. This is contributing to significant U.S. and global economic uncertainty, with the International Monetary Fund forecasting slower U.S. GDP growth compared to the prior year and higher inflation.

Organizational Structure
The simplified diagram below depicts our current organizational structure. The diagram does not depict all of our subsidiaries, including intermediate holding companies through which certain of the subsidiaries depicted are held.
Key Financial Measures and Indicators
We manage our business using certain financial measures and key operating metrics since we believe these metrics measure the productivity of our investment activities. We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). See “—Item 1. Financial Statements — Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements — Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” and “—Critical Accounting Policies.” Our key non-GAAP financial measures and operating indicators and metrics are discussed below.
Distributable Earnings
Distributable Earnings is derived from Blackstone’s segment reported results. Distributable Earnings is used to assess performance and amounts available for dividends to Blackstone stockholders, including Blackstone personnel and others who are limited partners of the Blackstone Holdings Partnerships. Distributable Earnings is the sum of Segment Distributable Earnings plus Net Interest and Dividend Income (Loss) less Taxes and Related Payables. Distributable Earnings excludes unrealized activity and is derived from and reconciled to, but not equivalent to, its most directly comparable GAAP measure of Income (Loss) Before Provision (Benefit) for Taxes. See “—Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for our reconciliation of Distributable Earnings.
67
Table of Contents
Net Interest and Dividend Income (Loss) is presented on a segment basis and is equal to Interest and Dividend Revenue less Interest Expense, adjusted for the impact of consolidation of Blackstone Funds, and interest expense associated with the tax receivable agreement.
Taxes and Related Payables represent the total GAAP tax provision adjusted to include only the current tax provision (benefit) calculated on Income (Loss) Before Provision (Benefit) for Taxes and including the payable under the tax receivable agreement. Further, the current tax provision utilized when calculating Taxes and Related Payables and Distributable Earnings reflects the benefit of deductions available to the company on certain expense items that are excluded from the underlying calculation of Segment Distributable Earnings and Total Segment Distributable Earnings, such as equity-based compensation charges and certain Transaction-Related and Non-Recurring Items where there is a current tax provision or benefit. The economic assumptions and methodologies that impact the implied income tax provision are the same as those methodologies and assumptions used in calculating the current income tax provision for Blackstone’s Consolidated Statements of Operations under GAAP, excluding the impact of divestitures and accrued tax contingencies and refunds which are reflected when paid or received. The Payable under the Tax Receivable Agreement reflects the expected amount of tax savings generated in the period that parties to the Tax Receivable Agreement are entitled to receive in future periods. Management believes that including the amount payable under the tax receivable agreement and utilizing the current income tax provision adjusted as described above when calculating Distributable Earnings is meaningful as it increases comparability between periods and more accurately reflects earnings that are available for distribution to stockholders.
Segment Distributable Earnings
Segment Distributable Earnings is Blackstone’s segment profitability measure used to make operating decisions and assess performance across Blackstone’s four segments. Blackstone believes it is useful to stockholders to review the measure that management uses in assessing segment performance. Segment Distributable Earnings represents the net realized earnings of Blackstone’s segments and is the sum of Fee Related Earnings and Net Realizations for each segment. Blackstone’s segments are presented on a basis that deconsolidates Blackstone Funds, eliminates non-controlling ownership interests in Blackstone’s consolidated operating partnerships, removes the amortization of intangible assets and removes Transaction-Related and Non-Recurring Items. Transaction-Related and Non-Recurring Items arise from corporate actions including acquisitions, divestitures, Blackstone’s initial public offering and non-recurring gains, losses, or other charges, if any. They consist primarily of equity-based compensation charges, gains and losses on contingent consideration arrangements, changes in the balance of the tax receivable agreement resulting from a change in tax law or similar event, transaction costs, gains or losses associated with these corporate actions and non-recurring gains, losses or other charges that affect period-to-period comparability and are not reflective of Blackstone’s operational performance. Segment Distributable Earnings excludes unrealized activity and is derived from and reconciled to, but not equivalent to, its most directly comparable GAAP measure of Income (Loss) Before Provision (Benefit) for Taxes. See “—Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for our reconciliation of Segment Distributable Earnings.
Net Realizations is presented on a segment basis and is the sum of Realized Principal Investment Income and Realized Performance Revenues (which refers to Realized Performance Revenues excluding Fee Related Performance Revenues), less Realized Performance Compensation (which refers to Realized Performance Compensation excluding Fee Related Performance Compensation and Equity-Based Performance Compensation).
Realized Performance Compensation reflects an increase, pursuant to a separate compensation program, in the aggregate Realized Performance Compensation paid to certain of our professionals above the amounts allocable to them based upon the percentage participation in the relevant performance plans previously awarded to them. The expectation is that for the full year 2025, Fee Related Compensation will be decreased by the total amount of additional Performance Compensation awarded for the year in respect of this compensation program. For the three months ended March 31, 2025, Realized Performance Compensation was increased by an aggregate
68
Table of Contents
of $21.3 million and Fee Related Compensation was decreased by $21.3 million. These changes to Realized Performance Compensation and Fee Related Compensation reduced Net Realizations, increased Fee Related Earnings and had a negative impact to Income Before Provision (Benefit) for Taxes and Distributable Earnings in the three months ended March 31, 2025. These changes are not expected to impact Income Before Provision (Benefits) for Taxes and Distributable Earnings for the year ending December 31, 2025. These changes had an impact on individual quarters in 2024 but did not impact Income Before Provision (Benefits) for Taxes and Distributable Earnings for the year ended December 31, 2024.
Fee Related Earnings
Fee Related Earnings is a performance measure used to assess Blackstone’s ability to generate profits from revenues that are measured and received on a recurring basis and not subject to future realization events. Blackstone believes Fee Related Earnings is useful to stockholders as it provides insight into the profitability of the portion of Blackstone’s business that is not dependent on realization activity. Fee Related Earnings equals management and advisory fees (net of management fee reductions and offsets) plus Fee Related Performance Revenues, less (a) Fee Related Compensation on a segment basis and (b) Other Operating Expenses. Fee Related Earnings is derived from and reconciled to, but not equivalent to, its most directly comparable GAAP measure of Income (Loss) Before Provision (Benefit) for Taxes. See “—Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for our reconciliation of Fee Related Earnings.
Fee Related Compensation is presented on a segment basis and refers to the compensation expense, excluding Equity-Based Compensation, directly related to (a) Management and Advisory Fees, Net and (b) Fee Related Performance Revenues, referred to as Fee Related Performance Compensation.
Fee Related Performance Revenues refers to the realized portion of Performance Revenues from Perpetual Capital that are (a) measured and received on a recurring basis and (b) not dependent on realization events from the underlying investments.
Other Operating Expenses is presented on a segment basis and is equal to General, Administrative and Other Expenses, adjusted to (a) remove transaction-related and non-recurring items that arise from corporate actions including acquisitions, divestitures, Blackstone’s initial public offering and non-recurring gains, losses or other charges, if any, (b) remove certain expenses reimbursed by the Blackstone Funds which are netted against Management and Advisory Fees, Net in Blackstone’s segment presentation and (c) give effect to an administrative fee collected on a quarterly basis from certain holders of Blackstone Holdings Partnership Units. The administrative fee is accounted for as a capital contribution under GAAP, but is reflected as a reduction of Other Operating Expenses in Blackstone’s segment presentation.
Adjusted Earnings Before Interest, Taxes and Depreciation and Amortization
Adjusted Earnings Before Interest, Taxes and Depreciation and Amortization (“Adjusted EBITDA”), is a supplemental measure used to assess performance derived from Blackstone’s segment results and may be used to assess its ability to service its borrowings. Adjusted EBITDA represents Distributable Earnings plus the addition of (a) Interest Expense on a segment basis, (b) Taxes and Related Payables and (c) Depreciation and Amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is derived from and reconciled to, but not equivalent to, its most directly comparable GAAP measure of Income (Loss) Before Provision (Benefit) for Taxes. See “—Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for our reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA.
Net Accrued Performance Revenues
Net Accrued Performance Revenues is a non-GAAP financial measure Blackstone believes is useful to stockholders as an indicator of potential future realized performance revenues based on the current investment portfolio of the funds and vehicles we manage. Net Accrued Performance Revenues represents the accrued
69
Table of Contents
performance revenues receivable by Blackstone, net of the related accrued performance compensation payable by Blackstone, excluding performance revenues that have been realized but not yet distributed as of the reporting date and clawback amounts, if any. Net Accrued Performance Revenues is derived from and reconciled to, but not equivalent to, its most directly comparable GAAP measure of Investments. See “—Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for our reconciliation of Net Accrued Performance Revenues and Note 2. “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies — Equity Method Investments” in the “Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements” in “—Item 1. Financial Statements” for additional information on the calculation of Investments — Accrued Performance Allocations.
Operating Metrics
The alternative asset management business is primarily based on managing third-party capital and does not require substantial capital investment to support rapid growth. Since our inception, we have developed and used various key operating metrics to assess and monitor the operating performance of our various alternative asset management businesses in order to monitor the effectiveness of our value creating strategies.
Total and Fee-Earning Assets Under Management
“Total Assets Under Management” refers to the invested and available capital in Blackstone-managed or advised vehicles (including, without limitation, investment funds and SMAs). The Total Assets Under Management attributable to an individual vehicle is dependent on the structure and investment strategy of such vehicle and accordingly, will vary from vehicle to vehicle. Total Assets Under Management generally equals the sum of the following across Blackstone-managed or advised vehicles, as applicable:
Uncalled commitments represent the capital we are entitled to call from investors pursuant to the terms of their respective capital commitments, including capital commitments to funds that have yet to commence their investment periods. Drawdown funds, perpetual capital vehicles, co-investment vehicles, and SMAs can each be structured with a commitment from an investor that is called over time as opposed to fully funded upon subscription.
Assets may be raised in one vehicle or business unit and subsequently invested in or managed or advised by another vehicle or business unit. Total Assets Under Management are reported in the segment where the assets are managed.
Our measurement of Total Assets Under Management includes commitments to, and the fair value of, invested capital in our funds from Blackstone and our personnel. Our calculation of Total Assets Under Management may differ from the calculations of other asset managers, and as a result this measure may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other asset managers. Our definition of Total Assets Under Management differs from the manner in which affiliated investment advisors report regulatory assets under management and may differ from the definition set forth in the agreements governing the vehicles we manage or advise.
“Fee-Earning Assets Under Management” refers to the portion of Total Assets Under Management on which we are entitled to earn management fees and/or performance revenues. The Fee-Earning Assets Under Management attributable to an individual vehicle is driven by the basis on which fees are earned and accordingly,
70
Table of Contents
will vary from vehicle to vehicle. Fee-Earning Assets Under Management generally equals the sum of the following across Blackstone-managed or advised vehicles, as applicable: (a) net asset value, (b) committed capital and remaining invested capital during the investment period and post-investment period, respectively, (c) invested capital (including leverage to the extent management fee-eligible), (d) gross asset value, (e) fair value of investments, or (f) the aggregate par amount of collateral assets, including principal cash, of CLOs.
Assets may be raised in one vehicle or business unit and subsequently invested in or managed or advised by another vehicle or business unit. Fee-Earning Assets Under Management are reported in the segment where the Total Assets Under Management are reported to the extent fee-paying to Blackstone.
While Fee-Earning Assets Under Management generally reflects Total Assets Under Management on which we are entitled to earn management fees, Fee-Earning Assets Under Management may also include Total Assets Under Management on which we are entitled to earn only performance revenues. Our calculation of Fee-Earning Assets Under Management may differ from the calculations of other asset managers, and as a result this measure may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other asset managers. Our definition of Fee-Earning Assets Under Management may differ from the definition set forth in the agreements governing the vehicles that we manage or advise.
Commitment-based drawdown structured funds generally do not permit investors to redeem their interests at their election. Certain of our open-ended vehicles generally afford an investor the right to withdraw or redeem their interests on a periodic basis (for example, annually, quarterly or monthly), typically with 2 to 95 days’ notice, depending on the fund and the liquidity profile of the underlying assets. In our perpetual capital vehicles where redemption rights exist, redemption requests are required to be fulfilled only (a) in Blackstone’s or the vehicles’ board’s discretion, as applicable, (b) to the extent there is sufficient new capital, or (c) where such required redemptions are limited in quantum, such as interval funds or in certain insurance-dedicated vehicles. Investment advisory agreements related to certain SMAs in our Credit & Insurance and Multi-Asset Investing segments, excluding SMAs in our insurance platform, may generally be terminated by an investor on 15 to 95 days’ notice. SMAs in our insurance platform can generally only be terminated for long-term underperformance, cause and certain other limited circumstances, in each case subject to Blackstone’s right to cure.
Perpetual Capital
“Perpetual Capital” refers to the component of assets under management with an indefinite term, that is not in liquidation, and for which there is no requirement to return capital to investors through redemption requests in the ordinary course of business, except where funded by new capital inflows or where required redemptions are limited in quantum. Perpetual Capital includes co-investment capital with an investor right to convert into Perpetual Capital.
In our Perpetual Capital vehicles where redemption rights exist, redemption requests are required to be fulfilled only (a) in Blackstone’s or the vehicles’ board’s discretion, as applicable, (b) to the extent there is sufficient new capital, or (c) where such required redemptions are limited in quantum, such as interval funds or in certain insurance-dedicated vehicles. Perpetual Capital includes co-investment capital with an investor right to convert into Perpetual Capital. We believe this measure is useful to stockholders as it represents capital we manage that has a longer duration and the ability to generate recurring revenues in a different manner than traditional fund structures.
Dry Powder
Dry Powder represents the amount of capital available for investment or reinvestment, including general partner and employee capital, and is an indicator of the capital we have available for future investments. We believe this measure is useful to stockholders as it provides insight into the extent to which capital is available for Blackstone to deploy capital into investment opportunities as they arise.
71
Table of Contents
Invested Performance Eligible Assets Under Management
Invested Performance Eligible Assets Under Management represents invested capital at fair value on which performance revenues could be earned if certain hurdles are met. We believe Invested Performance Eligible Assets Under Management is useful to stockholders as it provides insight into the capital deployed that has the potential to generate performance revenues.
Consolidated Results of Operations
Following is a discussion of our consolidated results of operations. For a more detailed discussion of the factors that affected the results of our four business segments (which are presented on a basis that deconsolidates the investment funds, eliminates non-controlling ownership interests in Blackstone’s consolidated operating partnerships and removes the amortization of intangibles assets and Transaction-Related and Non-Recurring Items) in these periods, see “—Segment Analysis” below.

Three Months Ended March 31, 2025 Compared to Three Months Ended March 31, 2024
Revenues
Revenues were $3.3 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2025, a decrease of $398.4 million, compared to $3.7 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2024. The decrease in Revenues was primarily attributable to a decrease of $469.2 million in Investment Income, which was primarily due to a decrease of $485.7 million in Unrealized Investment Income.
The $485.7 million decrease in Unrealized Investment Income was primarily attributable to lower net unrealized appreciation of investments in the three months ended March 31, 2025 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2024. Principal drivers were:
Expenses
Expenses were $1.9 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2025, an increase of $104.0 million, compared to $1.8 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2024. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase of $123.5 million in Total Compensation and Benefits, of which $234.6 million was an increase in Compensation, partially offset by a decrease of $94.3 million in Performance Allocations Compensation. The increase in Compensation was primarily due to the increase in Management and Advisory Fees, Net, on which a portion of compensation is based. The decrease in Performance Allocations Compensation was primarily due to a decrease in Investment Income, on which a portion of Compensation is based.
Other Income
Other Income (Loss) was $57.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2025, an increase of $75.3 million, compared to $(17.8) million for the three months ended March 31, 2024. The increase in Other Income (Loss) was due to an increase of $75.3 million in Net Gains (Losses) from Fund Investment Activities.
The increase in Net Gains (Losses) from Fund Investment Activities was primarily driven by an increase of $60.5 million in our Real Estate segment which was primarily driven by net unrealized appreciation of investments in our consolidated funds in the three months ended March 31, 2025 compared to net unrealized depreciation of investments in our consolidated funds in the three months ended March 31, 2024.
Provision for Taxes
Blackstone’s Provision for Taxes for the three months ended March 31, 2025 was $243.8 million, a decrease of $39.8 million, compared to $283.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024. This resulted in an effective tax rate of 16.8% and 15.1%, based on our Income Before Provision for Taxes of $1.5 billion and $1.9 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively.
The increase in Blackstone’s effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2025, compared to the three months ended March 31, 2024, relates primarily to the deferred tax impact of Blackstone’s investment in its operating partnerships.
74
Table of Contents
Blackstone had a corporate alternative minimum tax (“CAMT”) liability for the March 31, 2025 as calculated pursuant to the Inflation Reduction Act. Blackstone will continue to assess the overall impact to its Provision for Income Tax upon the issuance of applicable additional guidance by the U.S. Treasury Department related to interpretations of CAMT. For the three months ended March 31, 2025, there is no meaningful CAMT impact reflected in the Provision for Income Taxes given current year tax payments made under CAMT are permitted to be carried forward and used as credits in future years resulting in a deferred tax benefit.
Additional information regarding our income taxes can be found in Note 12. “Income Taxes” in the “Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements” in “—Item 1. Financial Statements” of this filing.
Non-Controlling Interests in Consolidated Entities
The Net Income Attributable to Redeemable Non-Controlling Interests in Consolidated Entities and Net Income Attributable to Non-Controlling Interests in Consolidated Entities is attributable to the consolidated Blackstone Funds. The amounts of these items vary directly with the performance of the consolidated Blackstone funds and largely eliminate the amount of Other Income (Loss) – Net Gains (Losses) from Fund Investment Activities from the Net Income Attributable to Blackstone Inc.
Net Income Attributable to Non-Controlling Interests in Blackstone Holdings is derived from the Income Before Provision for Taxes at the Blackstone Holdings level, excluding the Net Gains (Losses) from Fund Investment Activities and the percentage allocation of the income between Blackstone personnel and others who are limited partners of Blackstone Holdings and Blackstone after considering any contractual arrangements that govern the allocation of income such as fees allocable to Blackstone.
For the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, the Net Income Before Taxes allocated to Blackstone personnel and others who are limited partners of Blackstone Holdings was 38.0% and 38.8%, respectively. The decrease of 0.8% was primarily due to the conversion of Blackstone Holdings Partnership Units to shares of common stock and the vesting of shares of common stock.
The Other Income (Loss) — Change in Tax Receivable Agreement Liability was entirely allocated to Blackstone Inc.

Segment Analysis
Discussed below is our Segment Distributable Earnings for each of our segments. This information is reflected in the manner utilized by our senior management to make operating decisions, assess performance and allocate resources. References to “our” sectors or investments may also refer to portfolio companies and investments of the underlying funds that we manage.

Real Estate
The following table presents the results of operations for our Real Estate segment:
Three Months Ended March 31, 2025 Compared to Three Months Ended March 31, 2024
Segment Distributable Earnings were $495.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2025, a decrease of $120.9 million, compared to $616.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024. The decrease in Segment Distributable Earnings was primarily attributable to decreases of $101.2 million in Fee Related Earnings and $19.7 million in Net Realizations.
Our Real Estate segment strategies exhibited positive performance in the first quarter of 2025. This was supported by positive cash flow growth across nearly every area of the portfolio, continued improvement in the cost and availability of debt capital and strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. Recently announced tariffs in the U.S., however, have contributed to significant and ongoing uncertainty and volatility of markets. There is significant uncertainty as to the outcome of ongoing global trade negotiations, the extent of retaliatory measures taken by other countries and the ultimate impact on the U.S. and global economies. A prolonged period of policy-driven uncertainty and continued market volatility increases the likelihood of a slowdown in the U.S. and global economies and could impact the commercial real estate recovery, which could adversely affect valuations in our real estate portfolio. We also expect realization activity to remain muted in the face of such uncertainty and volatility. With respect to institutional fundraising, market volatility, uncertainty and geopolitical concerns have contributed to a limited number of investors pausing new commitments, but to date the overall impact on such fundraising has been immaterial. We have not seen a
broad-based
pullback in the private wealth channel, although a prolonged period of turbulence could adversely impact fundraising in the channel.
At the same time, the announced tariffs are likely to increase construction costs and further reduce already constrained new supply starts, including in certain sectors in which our global opportunistic and Core+ real estate portfolios are concentrated, such as logistics and rental housing. This should be supportive of real estate values over time, subject to inflation continuing to subside and absent recessionary conditions. Nevertheless, in certain markets and sectors with elevated near-term supply, including U.S. logistics and multifamily, growth has slowed and may moderate further. Select life science office, traditional office and U.K. student housing investments have also been negatively impacted by challenging sector dynamics and capital markets.

Fee Related Earnings
Fee Related Earnings were $484.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2025, a decrease of $101.2 million, compared to $586.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024. The decrease in Fee Related Earnings was primarily attributable to a decrease of $92.2 million in Fee Related Performance Revenues and a decrease of $19.6 million in Management Fees, Net.
Fee Related Performance Revenues were $37.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2025, a decrease of $92.2 million, compared to $130.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024. The decrease was primarily due to lower Fee Related Performance Revenues in BPP.
Management Fees, Net were $700.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2025, a decrease of $19.6 million, compared to $720.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, primarily driven by a decrease in Base Management Fees, partially offset by an increase in Transaction and Other Fees, Net. Base Management Fees decreased $29.6 million primarily due to a decrease in Fee-Earning Assets Under Management in Core+ and BREDS. Transaction and Other Fees, Net increased $11.0 million primarily due to an increase in acquisition fees paid to the advisor of our BREP funds.
Net Realizations
Net Realizations were $10.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2025, a decrease of $19.7 million, compared to $30.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024. The decrease in Net Realizations was primarily attributable to a decrease of $31.0 million in Realized Performance Revenues, partially offset by a decrease of $13.1 million in Realized Performance Compensation.
Realized Performance Revenues were $19.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2025, a decrease of $31.0 million, compared to $50.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024. The decrease was primarily due to lower Realized Performance Revenues in BREDS.
Realized Performance Compensation was $8.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2025, a decrease of $13.1 million, compared to $21.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024. The decrease was primarily due to the decrease in Realized Performance Revenues.

Funds With Closed Investment Periods as of March 31, 2025
The Real Estate segment has thirteen funds with closed investment periods as of March 31, 2025: BREP IX, BREP VIII, BREP VII, BREP VI, BREP V, BREP Europe VI, BREP Europe V, BREP Europe IV, BREP Europe III, BREP Asia II, BREP Asia I, BREDS IV and BREDS III. As of March 31, 2025, BREP VII, BREP VI, BREP V, BREP Europe VI, BREP Europe IV, BREP Europe III and BREP Asia I were above their carried interest thresholds (i.e., the preferred return payable to its limited partners before the general partner is eligible to receive carried interest) and would have been above their carried interest thresholds even if all remaining investments were valued at zero. BREP IX, BREP VIII, BREDS IV and BREDS III were above their carried interest thresholds as of March 31, 2025, while BREP Asia II and BREP Europe V were below their carried interest thresholds. Funds are considered above their carried interest thresholds based on the aggregate fund position, although individual limited partners may be below their respective carried interest thresholds in certain funds.
Private Equity
The following table presents the results of operations for our Private Equity segment:
Three Months Ended March 31, 2025 Compared to Three Months Ended March 31, 2024
Segment Distributable Earnings were $564.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2025, an increase of $64.2 million, compared to $500.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024. The increase in Segment Distributable Earnings was attributable to an increase of $127.9 million in Fee Related Earnings, partially offset by a decrease of $63.7 million in Net Realizations.
Our Private Equity segment exhibited positive performance across all strategies in the first quarter of 2025. Recently announced tariffs in the U.S., however, have contributed to significant and ongoing uncertainty and volatility of markets. There is significant uncertainty as to the outcome of ongoing global trade negotiations, the extent of retaliatory measures taken by other countries and the ultimate impact on the U.S. and global economies. We believe a relatively limited proportion of the Private Equity segment’s portfolio is exposed to direct first-order impacts from the announced tariffs. A relatively small number of companies, however, could be materially impacted

due to sales of physical goods into the U.S. with material international supply chain dependencies. A slowdown in the U.S. and global economies as a result of a prolonged period of policy-driven uncertainty and continued market volatility would more broadly adversely affect valuations in our Private Equity segment funds. We also expect realization activity to remain muted in the face of such uncertainty and volatility. With respect to institutional fundraising, market volatility, uncertainty and geopolitical concerns have contributed to a limited number of investors pause making new commitments, but to date the overall impact on such fundraising has been immaterial. We have not seen a broad-based pullback in the private wealth channel, although a prolonged period of turbulence could adversely impact fundraising in the channel.
Fee Related Earnings
Fee Related Earnings were $376.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2025, an increase of $127.9 million, compared to $248.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024. The increase in Fee Related Earnings was primarily attributable to increases of $120.6 million in Management and Advisory Fees, Net and $60.9 million in Fee Related Performance Revenues, partially offset by an increase of $40.8 million in Fee Related Compensation.
Management and Advisory Fees, Net were $621.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2025, an increase of $120.6 million, compared to $501.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, primarily driven by increases in Base Management Fees and Transaction, Advisory and Other Fees, Net. Base Management Fees increased $103.9 million primarily due to an increase in Fee-Earning Assets Under Management in BIP and BXPE, as well as fee holiday expirations of BCP IX and BETP IV. Transaction, Advisory and Other Fees, Net increased $27.3 million primarily due to increased volume of deal activity in BXCM.
Fee Related Performance Revenues were $60.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2025, an increase of $60.9 million, compared to the three months ended March 31, 2024. The increase was due to crystallization of performance revenues in BXPE.
Fee Related Compensation was $203.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2025, an increase of $40.8 million, compared to $162.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024. The increase was primarily due to increases in Fee Related Performance Revenues and Management and Advisory Fees, Net, both of which impact Fee Related Compensation.
Net Realizations
Net Realizations were $188.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2025, a decrease of $63.7 million, compared to $251.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024. The decrease in Net Realizations was primarily attributable to a decrease in Realized Performance Revenues of $99.8 million, partially offset by a decrease in Realized Performance Compensation of $49.3 million.
Realized Performance Revenues were $350.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2025, a decrease of $99.8 million, compared to $449.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024. The decrease was primarily due to decreases in Realized Performance Revenues in Corporate Private Equity and Tactical Opportunities.
Realized Performance Compensation was $171.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2025, a decrease of $49.3 million, compared to $220.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024. The decrease was primarily due to the decrease in Realized Performance Revenues.

Funds With Closed Investment Periods as of March 31, 2025
Corporate Private Equity has eleven funds with closed investment periods: BCP IV, BCP V, BCP VI, BCP VII, BCP VIII, BCOM, BEP I, BEP II, BEP III, BCEP I and BCP Asia I. As of March 31, 2025, BCP IV was above its carried interest threshold (i.e., the preferred return payable to its limited partners before the general partner is eligible to receive carried interest) and would still be above its carried interest threshold even if all remaining investments were valued at zero. BCP V is comprised of two fund classes, the BCP V “main fund” and BCP V-AC fund. Within these fund classes, the general partner is subject to equalization such that (a) the general partner accrues carried interest when the respective carried interest for either fund class is positive and (b) the general partner realizes carried interest so long as clawback obligations, if any, for either of the respective fund classes are fully satisfied. BCP V, BCP VI, BCP VII, BCP VIII, BCOM, BEP I, BEP II, BEP III, BCEP I and BCP Asia I were above their respective carried interest thresholds. Funds are considered above their carried interest thresholds based on the aggregate fund position, although individual limited partners may be below their respective carried interest thresholds in certain funds.
Tactical Opportunities has various funds with closed investment periods, including but not limited to: BTOF-POOL, BTOF-POOL II, and BTOF-POOL III, which are each above their carried interest thresholds based on aggregate fund position. Blackstone Growth has one fund with a closed investment period, BXG I, which is not above its carried interest threshold. Secondaries has various funds with closed investment periods, including but not limited to: Strategic Partners Infrastructure III, Strategic Partners VIII, Strategic Partners Real Estate VII and BSCH I which are above their respective carried interest thresholds based on aggregate fund position. Blackstone Life Sciences has two funds with a closed investment period: Clarus IV and BXLS V, which were above their carried interest thresholds.

Credit & Insurance
The following table presents the results of operations for our Credit & Insurance segment:
Three Months Ended March 31, 2025 Compared to Three Months Ended March 31, 2024
Segment Distributable Earnings were $503.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2025, an increase of $217.7 million, compared to $285.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024. The increase in Segment Distributable Earnings was attributable to increases of $72.1 million in Fee Related Earnings and $145.6 million in Net Realizations.
Our Credit & Insurance segment demonstrated strong performance in the first quarter of 2025. Credit & Insurance funds have benefited from an environment of high interest rates, although these rates have decreased relative to recent years. A further decline in interest rates and/or widening of credit spreads would make it more difficult for our credit funds to replicate recent strong performance. Recently announced tariffs in the U.S., however, have contributed to significant and ongoing uncertainty and volatility of markets. There is significant uncertainty as to the outcome of ongoing global trade negotiations, the extent of retaliatory measures taken by other countries and the ultimate impact on the U.S. and global economies. We believe a relatively limited proportion of the Credit & Insurance segment’s portfolio is exposed to direct first-order impacts from the announced tariffs. A relatively small portion of our Credit and Insurance funds’ borrowers, however, are in sectors that are more likely to be materially impacted due to sales of physical goods into the U.S. with material international supply chain dependencies. A slowdown in the U.S. and global economies as a result of a prolonged period of policy-driven uncertainty and continued market volatility would increase the risk of defaults by borrowers and could more broadly adversely affect performance in our Credit & Insurance portfolio. With respect to institutional fundraising, market volatility, uncertainty and geopolitical concerns have contributed to a limited number of investors pausing new commitments, but to date the overall impact on such fundraising has been immaterial. We have not seen a broad-based pullback in the private wealth channel, although a prolonged period of turbulence could adversely impact fundraising in the channel.

More broadly, however, we continue to see long-term structural shifts in the lending market. This has contributed to robust momentum in non-investment grade strategies, investment grade private credit and perpetual capital strategies, opportunities to generate excess returns relative to liquid markets in our non-investment grade strategies and attractive and sizeable deployment opportunities in investment-grade strategies. Moreover, rapidly expanding private credit markets and other opportunities for corporate and bank partnerships should continue to be supportive of overall transaction activity, including deployment. Given the significant opportunities in the space, competition in the private credit markets has increased and is likely to increase further as a result of product innovation and customization by private credit managers. In addition, regulatory measures aimed at reducing burden on U.S. banks, such as less onerous bank regulatory capital requirements, may also increase competition.
Fee Related Earnings
Fee Related Earnings were $344.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2025, an increase of $72.1 million, compared to $272.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024. The increase in Fee Related Earnings was attributable to increases of $77.2 million in Management Fees, Net and $29.7 million in Fee Related Performance Revenues, partially offset by an increase of $23.1 million in Fee Related Compensation.
Management Fees, Net were $447.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2025, an increase of $77.2 million, compared to $369.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, primarily driven by an increase in Base Management Fees. Base Management Fees increased $82.3 million primarily due to inflows from Fee-Earning Assets Under Management in direct lending.
Fee Related Performance Revenues were $195.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2025, an increase of $29.7 million, compared to $165.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024. The increase was primarily due to higher net investment income and Fee-Earning Assets Under Management in BCRED.
Fee Related Compensation was $201.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2025, an increase of $23.1 million, compared to $178.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024. The increase was primarily due to increases in Management Fees, Net and Fee Related Performance Revenues, both of which impact Fee Related Compensation.
Net Realizations
Net Realizations were $159.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2025, an increase of $145.6 million, compared to $13.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024. The increase in Net Realizations was attributable to increases of $104.3 million in Realized Principal Investment Income and $76.5 million in Realized Performance Revenues, partially offset by an increase of $35.2 million in Realized Performance Compensation.
Realized Principal Investment Income was $107.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2025, an increase of $104.3 million, compared to $3.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024. The increase was primarily due to the sale of Bistro, a portfolio visualization software platform developed by Blackstone, to Clearwater Analytics.
Realized Performance Revenues were $91.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2025, an increase of $76.5 million, compared to $15.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024. The increase was primarily due to higher Realized Performance Revenues in our Mezzanine and Stressed/Distressed funds.
Realized Performance Compensation was $40.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2025, an increase of $35.2 million, compared to $5.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024. The increase was primarily due to the increase in Realized Performance Revenues.

Multi-Asset Investing
The following table presents the results of operations for our Multi-Asset Investing segment:
n/m Not meaningful.
Three Months Ended March 31, 2025 Compared to Three Months Ended March 31, 2024
Segment Distributable Earnings were $55.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2025, an increase of $4.8 million, compared to $50.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024. The increase in Segment Distributable Earnings was attributable to increases of $3.3 million in Fee Related Earnings and $1.5 million in Net Realizations.
Most strategies across our Multi-Asset Investing segment exhibited positive performance in the first quarter of 2025, with significantly less volatility than the broader markets. In particular, the Absolute Return Composite had its twentieth consecutive quarter of positive performance, benefiting from performance across strategies, including quantitative, macro and credit. Recently announced tariffs in the U.S., however, have contributed to significant and ongoing uncertainty and volatility of markets. There is significant uncertainty as to the outcome of ongoing global trade negotiations, the extent of retaliatory measures taken by other countries and the ultimate impact on the U.S. and global economies. Segment Distributable Earnings in the Multi-Asset Investing segment would likely be negatively impacted by a significant or sustained weak market environment or decline in asset prices, including as a result of concerns over trade policy. Nevertheless, certain strategies in our Multi-Asset Strategy segment are designed to capitalize on periods of market volatility, which may mitigate the potential impact of such volatility.
104
Table of Contents
In addition, certain of our strategies are designed to benefit from a high-interest rate environment. Declining interest rates may make it more difficult for these Multi-Asset Investing strategies to replicate their positive performance. Conversely, if interest rates remain at sustained high levels for an extended period, certain investors may seek to reallocate capital away from traditional Multi-Asset Investing strategies in favor of fixed income investments. Outperformance by our Multi-Asset Investing segment strategies in a weak market environment has in some cases resulted in such strategies representing an increasing portion of the value of certain investors’ portfolios, which may limit such investors’ ability to allocate additional capital to certain funds in the segment, or result in such investors seeking to withdraw capital from such funds.
Fee Related Earnings
Fee Related Earnings were $56.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2025, an increase of $3.3 million, compared to $53.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024. The increase in Fee Related Earnings was primarily attributable to an increase of $6.2 million in Management Fees, Net, partially offset by an increase of $3.1 million in Fee Related Compensation.
Management Fees, Net were $122.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2025, an increase of $6.2 million, compared to $116.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in Base Management Fees. Base Management Fees increased $5.8 million primarily due to an increase in Fee-Earning Assets Under Management in Absolute Return.
Fee Related Compensation was $41.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2025, an increase of $3.1 million, compared to $38.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024. The increase was primarily due to an increase in Management Fees, Net, on which a portion of Fee Related Compensation is based.
Net Realizations
Net Realizations were $(0.7) million for the three months ended March 31, 2025, an increase of $1.5 million, compared to $(2.2) million for the three months ended March 31, 2024. The increase was attributable to an increase of $18.7 million in Realized Principal Investment Income (Loss) and a decrease of $4.8 million in Realized Performance Compensation, partially offset by a decrease of $22.1 million in Realized Performance Revenues.
Realized Principal Investment Income (Loss) was $0.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2025, an increase of $18.7 million, compared to $(18.2) million for the three months ended March 31, 2024. The increase was primarily due to higher realized losses in Multi-Strategy for the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2025.
Realized Performance Revenues were $(0.7) million for the three months ended March 31, 2025, a decrease of $22.1 million, compared to $21.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024. The decrease was primarily due to lower Realized Performance Revenues in Absolute Return and Multi-Strategy.
Realized Performance Compensation was $0.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2025, a decrease of $4.8 million, compared to $5.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in Realized Performance Revenues.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
General
Blackstone’s business model derives revenue primarily from third-party Assets Under Management. Blackstone is not a capital or balance sheet intensive business and targets operating expense levels such that total management and advisory fees exceed total operating expenses each period. As a result, we require limited capital resources to support the working capital or operating needs of our businesses. We draw primarily on the long-term committed or invested capital of investors in our investment vehicles to fund the investment requirements of the Blackstone Funds and use our own realizations and cash flows to invest in growth initiatives, make commitments to our own funds, where our minimum general partner commitments are generally less than 5% of the limited partner commitments of a fund, and pay dividends to stockholders and distributions to holders of Holdings Units.
Fluctuations in our statement of financial condition result primarily from activities of the Blackstone Funds that are consolidated as well as business transactions, such as the issuance of senior notes. The majority economic ownership interests of such consolidated Blackstone funds are reflected as Redeemable Non-Controlling Interests in Consolidated Entities, and Non-Controlling Interests in Consolidated Entities in the Consolidated Financial Statements. The consolidation of these Blackstone funds has no net effect on Blackstone’s Net Income or Equity. Additionally, fluctuations in our statement of financial condition also include appreciation or depreciation in Blackstone investments in the non-consolidated Blackstone funds, additional investments and redemptions of such interests in the non-consolidated Blackstone funds and the collection of receivables related to management and advisory fees.

Table of Contents
Total Assets were $45.3 billion as of March 31, 2025, an increase of $1.8 billion from December 31, 2024. The increase in Total Assets was principally due to increases of $1.7 billion in total assets attributable to consolidated Blackstone funds and $274.0 million in total assets attributable to consolidated operating partnerships.
Total Liabilities were $25.4 billion as of March 31, 2025, an increase of $1.4 billion from December 31, 2024. The increase in Total Liabilities was principally due to increases of $733.1 million in total liabilities attributable to consolidated operating partnerships and $686.3 million in total liabilities attributable to consolidated Blackstone funds.
Sources and Uses of Liquidity
We have multiple sources of liquidity to meet our capital needs, including annual cash flows, accumulated earnings in our businesses, the proceeds from our issuances of senior notes and other borrowings, liquid investments we hold on our balance sheet and access to our $4.325 billion committed Revolving Credit Facility. As of March 31, 2025, Blackstone had $2.4 billion in Cash and Cash Equivalents, $106.7 million invested in Corporate Treasury Investments and $6.3 billion in Other Investments (which included $5.8 billion of liquid investments), against $12.3 billion in borrowings, which included our bond issuances and $900.0 million of outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility.

Table of Contents
In addition to the cash we receive from our notes offerings and availability under the Revolving Credit Facility and other borrowings, we expect to receive (a) cash generated from operating activities, (b) Performance Revenue realizations, and (c) realizations on the fund investments that we make. The amounts received from these three sources in particular may vary substantially from year to year and quarter to quarter depending on the frequency and size of realization events or net returns experienced by our investment funds. Our available capital could be adversely affected if there are prolonged periods of few substantial realizations from our investment funds accompanied by substantial capital calls for new investments from those investment funds. Therefore, Blackstone’s commitments to our funds are taken into consideration when managing our overall liquidity and cash position.
We expect that our primary liquidity needs will be cash to (a) provide capital to facilitate the growth of our existing businesses, which includes, without limitation, funding our general partner and co-investment commitments to our funds and warehousing investments for our funds, (b) provide capital for business expansion, (c) pay operating expenses, including cash compensation to our employees, and other obligations as they arise, including servicing debts, (d) pay income taxes and (e) pay dividends to our stockholders, make distributions to the holders of Blackstone Holdings Partnership Units and make repurchases under our share repurchase program.

Blackstone, through Blackstone Holdings Finance Co. L.L.C., has a $4.325 billion unsecured Revolving Credit Facility with Citibank, N.A., as administrative agent with a maturity date of December 15, 2028. As of March 31, 2025, Blackstone had $900.0 million of outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility. Borrowings may also be made in U.K. sterling, euros, Swiss francs, Japanese yen or Canadian dollars, in each case subject to certain sub-limits. The Revolving Credit Facility contains customary representations, covenants and events of default. Financial covenants consist of a maximum net leverage ratio and a requirement to keep a minimum amount of fee-earning assets under management, each tested quarterly.

Table of Contents
Guarantees
Blackstone and certain of its consolidated funds provide financial guarantees. The amounts and nature of these guarantees are described in Note 16. “Commitments and Contingencies — Contingencies — Guarantees” in the “Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements” in “—Item 1. Financial Statements” of this filing.
Indemnifications
In many of its service contracts, Blackstone agrees to indemnify the third-party service provider under certain circumstances. The terms of the indemnities vary from contract to contract and the amount of indemnification liability, if any, cannot be determined and has not been included in the above contractual obligations table or recorded in our condensed consolidated financial statements as of March 31, 2025.
Clawback Obligations
Performance Allocations are subject to clawback to the extent that the Performance Allocations received to date with respect to a fund exceed the amount due to Blackstone based on cumulative results of that fund. The amounts and nature of Blackstone’s clawback obligations are described in Note 16. “Commitments and Contingencies — Contingencies — Contingent Obligations (Clawback)” in the “Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements” in “—Item 1. Financial Statements” of this filing.

Share Repurchase Program
During the three months ended March 31, 2025, Blackstone repurchased 0.2 million shares of common stock at a total cost of $31.0 million. As of March 31, 2025, the amount remaining available for repurchases under the program was $1.8 billion.
On July 16, 2024, Blackstone’s board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $2.0 billion of common stock and Blackstone Holdings Partnership Units. Under the repurchase program, repurchases may be made from time to time in open market transactions, in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. The timing and the actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including legal requirements, price and economic and market conditions. The repurchase program may be changed, suspended or discontinued at any time and does not have a specified expiration date.
Dividends
Our intention is to pay to holders of common stock a quarterly dividend representing approximately 85% of Blackstone Inc.’s share of Distributable Earnings, subject to adjustment by amounts determined by our board of directors to be necessary or appropriate to provide for the conduct of our business, to make appropriate investments in our business and funds, to comply with applicable law, any of our debt instruments or other agreements, or to provide for future cash requirements such as tax-related payments, clawback obligations and dividends to stockholders for any ensuing quarter. The dividend amount could also be adjusted upward in any one quarter.
For Blackstone’s definition of Distributable Earnings, see “—Key Financial Measures and Indicators.”
All of the foregoing is subject to the qualification that the declaration and payment of any dividends are at the sole discretion of our board of directors, and our board of directors may change our dividend policy at any time, including, without limitation, to reduce such quarterly dividends or even to eliminate such dividends entirely.
Because the publicly traded entity and/or its wholly owned subsidiaries must pay taxes and make payments under the tax receivable agreements, the amounts ultimately paid as dividends by Blackstone to common stockholders in respect of each fiscal year are generally expected to be less, on a per share or per unit basis, than the amounts distributed by the Blackstone Holdings Partnerships to the Blackstone personnel and others who are limited partners of the Blackstone Holdings Partnerships in respect of their Blackstone Holdings Partnership Units.
Dividends are treated as qualified dividends to the extent of Blackstone’s current and accumulated earnings and profits, with any excess dividends treated as a return of capital to the extent of the stockholder’s basis.
120
Table of Contents
The following graph shows fiscal quarterly and annual per common stockholder dividends for 2025 and 2024. Dividends are declared and paid in the quarter subsequent to the quarter in which they are earned.
With respect to the first quarter of fiscal year 2025, we paid to stockholders of our common stock a dividend of $0.93 per share. With respect to fiscal year 2024, we paid stockholders aggregate dividends of $3.95 per share.
Leverage
We may, under certain circumstances, use leverage opportunistically and over time to create the most efficient capital structure for Blackstone and our stockholders. In addition to the borrowings from our notes issuances and our Revolving Credit Facility, we may use asset based financing arrangements, including but not limited to margin loans, reverse repurchase agreements, repurchase agreements and securities sold, not yet purchased. Reverse repurchase agreements are entered into primarily to take advantage of opportunistic yields otherwise absent in the overnight markets and also to use the collateral received to cover securities sold, not yet purchased. Repurchase agreements are entered into primarily to opportunistically yield higher spreads on purchased securities. The balances held in these financial instruments fluctuate based on Blackstone’s liquidity needs, market conditions and investment risk profiles.

Critical Accounting Policies
We prepare our condensed consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP. In applying many of these accounting principles, we need to make assumptions, estimates and/or judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses in our condensed consolidated financial statements. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. These assumptions, estimates and/or judgments, however, are often subjective. Actual results may be affected negatively based on changing circumstances. If actual amounts are ultimately different from our estimates, the revisions are included in our results of operations for the period in which the actual amounts become known. We believe the following critical accounting policies could potentially produce materially different results if we were to change underlying assumptions, estimates and/or judgments. For a description of our accounting policies, see Note 2. “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in the “Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements” in “—Item 1. Financial Statements” of this filing.
Principles of Consolidation
For a description of our accounting policy on consolidation, see Note 2. “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies — Consolidation” and Note 8. “Variable Interest Entities” in the “Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements” in “—Item 1. Financial Statements” for detailed information on Blackstone’s involvement with VIEs. The following discussion is intended to provide supplemental information about how the application of consolidation principles impact our financial results, and management’s process for implementing those principles including areas of significant judgment.
The determination that Blackstone holds a controlling financial interest in a Blackstone Fund or investment vehicle significantly changes the presentation of our condensed consolidated financial statements. In our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Position included in this filing, we present 100% of the assets and liabilities of consolidated VIEs along with a non-controlling interest which represents the portion of the consolidated vehicle’s interests held by third parties. However, assets of our consolidated VIEs can only be used to settle obligations of the consolidated VIE and are not available for general use by Blackstone. Further, the liabilities of our consolidated VIEs do not have recourse to the general credit of Blackstone. In the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations, we eliminate any management fees, Incentive Fees, or Performance Allocations received or accrued from consolidated VIEs as they are considered intercompany transactions. We recognize 100% of the consolidated VIE’s investment income (loss) and allocate the portion of that income (loss) attributable to third-party ownership to non-controlling interests in arriving at Net Income Attributable to Blackstone Inc.

Table of Contents
The assessment of whether we consolidate a Blackstone Fund or investment vehicle we manage requires the application of significant judgment. These judgments are applied both at the time we become involved with the VIE and on an ongoing basis and include, but are not limited to:
Revenue Recognition
For a description of our accounting policy on revenue recognition, see Note 2. “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies — Revenue Recognition” in the “Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements” in “—Item 1. Financial Statements.” For an additional description of the nature of our revenue arrangements, including how management fees, Incentive Fees, and Performance Allocations are generated, please refer to “Part I. Item 1. Business — Fee Structure/Incentive Arrangements” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024. The following discussion is intended to provide supplemental information about how the application of revenue recognition principles impact our financial results, and management’s process for implementing those principles including areas of significant judgment.
Management and Advisory Fees, Net
— Blackstone earns base management fees from its customers at a fixed percentage of a calculation base. The range of management fee rates and the calculation base from which they are earned, generally, are as follows:
For vehicles within the Real Estate segment:
For vehicles within the Private Equity segment:
123
Table of Contents
For vehicles within the Credit & Insurance segment:
For vehicles within the Multi-Asset Investing segment:
Management fee calculations based on committed capital or invested capital are mechanical in nature and therefore do not require the use of significant estimates or judgments. Management fee calculations based on net asset value, gross asset value, or investment fair value depend on the fair value of the underlying investments within the funds. Estimates and assumptions are made when determining the fair value of the underlying investments within the funds and could vary depending on the valuation methodology that is used as well as economic conditions. See “—Fair Value” below for further discussion of the judgment required for determining the fair value of the underlying investments.
Investment Income (Loss)
— Performance Allocations are made to the general partner based on cumulative fund performance to date, subject to a preferred return to limited partners. Blackstone has concluded that investments made alongside its limited partners in a partnership which entitle Blackstone to a Performance Allocation represent equity method investments that are not in the scope of the GAAP guidance on accounting for revenues from contracts with customers. Blackstone accounts for these arrangements under the equity method of accounting. Under the equity method, Blackstone’s share of earnings (losses) from equity method investments is determined using a balance sheet approach referred to as the hypothetical liquidation at book value (“HLBV”) method. Under the HLBV method, at the end of each reporting period Blackstone calculates the accrued Performance Allocations that would be due to Blackstone for each fund pursuant to the fund agreements as if the fair value of the underlying investments were realized as of such date, irrespective of whether such amounts have been realized. Performance Allocations are subject to clawback to the extent that the Performance Allocation received to date exceeds the amount due to Blackstone based on cumulative results.
The change in the fair value of the investments held by certain Blackstone Funds is a significant input into the accrued Performance Allocation calculation and accrual for potential repayment of previously received Performance Allocations. Estimates and assumptions are made when determining the fair value of the underlying investments within the funds. See “—Fair Value” below for further discussion related to significant estimates and assumptions used for determining fair value of the underlying investments.
Fair Value
Blackstone uses fair value throughout the reporting process. For a description of our accounting policies related to valuation, see Note 2. “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies — Fair Value of Financial Instruments” and “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies — Investments, at Fair Value” in the “Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements” in “—Item 1. Financial Statements” of this filing. The following discussion is intended to provide supplemental information about how the application of fair value principles impact our financial results, and management’s process for implementing those principles including areas of significant judgment.
124
Table of Contents
The fair value of the investments held by Blackstone Funds is the primary input to the calculation of certain of our management fees, Incentive Fees, Performance Allocations and the related Compensation we recognize. Generally, Blackstone Funds are accounted for in accordance with the GAAP guidance on investment companies, and under the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Audit and Accounting Guide, Investment Companies, and reflect their investments, including majority-owned and controlled investments, at fair value. In the absence of observable market prices, we utilize valuation methodologies applied on a consistent basis and assumptions that we believe market participants would use to determine the fair value of the investments. For investments where little market activity exists management’s determination of fair value is based on the best information available in the circumstances, which may incorporate management’s own assumptions and involves a significant degree of judgment, and the consideration of a combination of internal and external factors, including the appropriate risk adjustments for non-performance and liquidity risks.
Blackstone has also elected the fair value option for certain instruments it owns directly, including loans and receivables, investments in private debt securities and other proprietary investments. Blackstone is required to measure certain financial instruments at fair value, including debt instruments, equity securities and freestanding derivatives.
Fair Value of Investments or Instruments That Are Publicly Traded
Securities that are publicly traded and for which a quoted market exists will be valued at the closing price of such securities in the principal market in which the security trades, or in the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market on the valuation date. When a quoted price in an active market exists, no block discounts or control premiums are permitted regardless of the size of the public security held. In some cases, securities will include legal and contractual restrictions limiting their purchase and sale for a period of time. A discount to the publicly traded price may be appropriate in instances where a legal restriction is a characteristic of the security, such as may be required under SEC Rule 144. The amount of the discount, if taken, shall be determined based on the time period that must pass before the restricted security becomes unrestricted or otherwise available for sale.
Fair Value of Investments or Instruments That Are Not Publicly Traded
Investments for which market prices are not observable include private investments in the equity or debt of operating companies or real estate properties. Our primary methodology for determining the fair values of such investments is generally the income approach which provides an indication of fair value based on the present value of cash flows that a business, security, or property is expected to generate in the future. The most widely used methodology under the income approach is the discounted cash flow method which includes significant assumptions about the underlying investment’s projected net earnings or cash flows, discount rate, capitalization rate and exit multiple. Our secondary methodology, generally used to corroborate the results of the income approach, is typically the market approach. The most widely used methodology under the market approach relies upon valuations for comparable public companies, transactions, or assets, and includes making judgments about which companies, transactions, or assets are comparable. Depending on the facts and circumstances associated with the investment, different primary and secondary methodologies may be used including option value, contingent claims or scenario analysis, yield analysis, projected cash flow through maturity or expiration, discount to sale, probability weighted methods or recent round of financing.
In certain cases, debt and equity securities are valued on the basis of prices from an orderly transaction between market participants provided by reputable dealers or pricing services. In determining the value of a particular investment, pricing services may use certain information with respect to transactions in such investments, quotations from dealers, pricing matrices and market transactions in comparable investments and various relationships between investments.

Management Process on Fair Value
Due to the importance of fair value throughout the condensed consolidated financial statements and the significant judgment required to be applied in arriving at those fair values, we have developed a process around valuation that incorporates several levels of approval and review from both internal and external sources. Investments held by Blackstone Funds and investment vehicles are valued on at least a quarterly basis by our internal valuation or asset management teams, which are independent from our investment teams. For investments held by vehicles managed by more than one business unit, Blackstone has developed a process designed to facilitate coordination and alignment, as appropriate, of the fair value of in-scope investments across business units.
For investments valued utilizing the income method and where Blackstone has information rights, we generally have a direct line of communication with each of the Companies’ and underlying assets’ finance teams and collect financial data used to support projections used in a discounted cash flow analysis. The valuation team then analyzes the data received and updates the valuation models reflecting any changes in the underlying cash flow projections, weighted-average cost of capital, exit multiple or capitalization rate, and any other valuation input relevant to economic conditions.
The results of all valuations of investments held by Blackstone Funds and investment vehicles are reviewed by the relevant business unit’s valuation sub-committee, which is comprised of key personnel from the business unit, typically the chief investment officer, chief operating officer, chief financial officer, chief compliance officer (or their respective equivalents where applicable) and other senior managing directors in the business. To further corroborate results, each business unit also generally obtains either a positive assurance opinion or a range of value from an independent valuation party, at least annually for internally prepared valuations for investments that have been held by Blackstone Funds and investment vehicles for greater than a year and quarterly for certain investments. Our firmwide valuation committee, chaired by our Chief Financial Officer and comprised of senior members of our businesses and representatives from corporate functions, including legal and finance, reviews the valuation process for investments held by us and our investment vehicles, including the application of appropriate valuation standards on a consistent basis. Each quarter, the valuation process is also reviewed by the audit committee of our board of directors, which is comprised of our non-employee directors.
Income Tax
For a description of our accounting policy on taxes and additional information on taxes see Note 2. “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” and Note 12. “Income Taxes” in the “Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements” in “—Item 1. Financial Statements” of this filing.
Our provision for income taxes is comprised of current and deferred taxes. Current income taxes approximate taxes to be paid or refunded for the current period. Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the applicable enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when such differences are expected to reverse.
Additionally, significant judgment is required in estimating the provision for (benefit from) income taxes, current and deferred tax balances (including any valuation allowance), accrued interest or penalties and uncertain tax positions. In evaluating these judgments, we consider, among other items, projections of taxable income (including the character of such income), beginning with historic results and incorporating assumptions of the amount of future pretax operating income. These assumptions about future taxable income require significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates that Blackstone uses to manage its business. To the extent any portion of the deferred tax assets are not considered to be more likely than not to be realized, a valuation allowance is recorded.

Revisions in estimates and/or actual costs of a tax assessment may ultimately be materially different from the recorded accruals and unrecognized tax benefits, if any.
Recent Accounting Developments
Information regarding recent accounting developments and their impact on Blackstone, if any, can be found in Note 2. “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in the “Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements” in “—Item 1. Financial Statements” of this filing.
Our predominant exposure to market risk is related to our role as general partner or investment adviser to the Blackstone Funds and the sensitivities to movements in the fair value of their investments, including the effect on management fees, performance revenues and investment income. There were no material changes in our market risks as of March 31, 2025 as compared to December 31, 2024. For additional information, refer to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024.
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
We maintain “disclosure controls and procedures,” as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing disclosure controls and procedures, our management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible disclosure controls and procedures. The design of any disclosure controls and procedures also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired objectives.
Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) are effective at the reasonable assurance level to accomplish their objectives of ensuring that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
No change in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) occurred during our most recent quarter, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Part II. Other Information
We may from time to time be involved in litigation and claims incidental to the conduct of our business. Our businesses are also subject to extensive regulation, which may result in regulatory proceedings against us. See “Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024. We are not currently subject to any pending legal (including judicial, regulatory, administrative or arbitration) proceedings that we expect to have a material impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements. However, given the inherent unpredictability of these types of proceedings and the potentially large and/or indeterminate amounts that could be sought, an adverse outcome in certain matters could have a material effect on Blackstone’s financial results in any particular period. See “Part I. Item 1. Financial Statements — Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements — Note 16. Commitments and Contingencies — Contingencies — Litigation.”
For a discussion of our potential risks and uncertainties, see the information under the heading “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024 and in our subsequently filed periodic reports as such factors may be updated from time to time, all of which are accessible on the Securities and Exchange Commission’s website at www.sec.gov.
See “Part I. Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Business Environment” in this report for a discussion of the conditions in the financial markets and economic conditions affecting our businesses. This discussion updates, and should be read together with, the risk factor entitled “Difficult market and geopolitical conditions can adversely affect our business in many ways, each of which could materially reduce our revenue, earnings and cash flow and adversely affect our financial prospects and condition.” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024.
The risks described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our subsequently filed periodic reports are not the only risks facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results.
