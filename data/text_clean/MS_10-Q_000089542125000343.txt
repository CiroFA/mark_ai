Management’s Discussion and Analysis includes certain metrics that we believe to be useful to us, investors, analysts and other stakeholders by providing further transparency about, or an additional means of assessing, our financial condition and operating results. Such metrics, when used, are defined and may be different from or inconsistent with metrics used by other companies.
The results of operations in the past have been, and in the future may continue to be, materially affected by: competition; legislative, legal and regulatory developments; and other risk factors. These factors also may have an adverse impact on our ability to achieve our strategic objectives. Additionally, the discussion of our results of operations herein may contain forward-looking statements. These statements, which reflect management’s beliefs and expectations, are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. For a discussion of the risks and uncertainties that may affect our future results, see “Forward-Looking Statements”, “Business—Competition”, “Business—Supervision and Regulation” and “Risk Factors” in the 2024 Form 10-K and “Liquidity and Capital Resources—Regulatory Requirements” herein.
Executive Summary
Overview of Financial Results
Consolidated Results—Three Months Ended March 31, 2025
•
The Firm reported net revenues of $17.7 billion and net income of $4.3 billion
reflecting strong results across our business segments.
•
The Firm delivered ROE of 17.4% and ROTCE of 23.0% (see “Selected Non-GAAP Financial Information” herein).
•
The Firm’s expense efficiency ratio was 68%. Expenses for the quarter included $144 million of severance costs related to a March employee action across our business segments. (See “Non-Interest Expenses” herein for more information).
•
The Firm accreted $1.9 billion
of Common Equity Tier 1 capital
. At March 31, 2025, the Firm’s Standardized Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio was 15.3%.
•
Institutional Securities reported net revenues of $9.0 billion reflecting strong performance in Equity and in Investment Banking on higher Fixed Income underwriting revenues.
•
Wealth Management delivered a pre-tax margin of 26.6%. Net revenues of $7.3 billion reflect strong Asset management revenues. The business added net new assets of $94 billion and f
ee-
based asset flows were $30 billion.
•
Investment Management results reflect net revenues of $1.6 billion, primarily driven by asset management fees on higher average AUM of $1.7 trillion.

Net Income Applicable to Morgan Stanley
($ in millions)
Earnings per Diluted Common Share
We reported net revenues of $17.7 billion in the quarter ended March 31, 2025 (“current quarter,” or “1Q 2025”), which increased by 17% compared with $15.1 billion in the quarter ended March 31, 2024 (“prior year quarter,” or “1Q 2024”). Net income applicable to Morgan Stanley was $4.3 billion in the current quarter, which increased by 26% compared with $3.4 billion in the prior year quarter. Diluted earnings per common share was $2.60 in the current quarter, which increased by 29% compared with $2.02 in the prior year quarter.
Non-Interest Expenses
($ in millions)
•
Compensation and benefits expenses of $7,521 million in the current quarter increased 12% from the prior year quarter, primarily due to higher discretionary incentive compensation and higher formulaic payout to Wealth Management representatives, both on higher revenues, and higher severance costs, partially offset by lower expenses related to certain employee deferred cash-based compensation plans linked to investment performance (“DCP”).
During the current quarter, as a result of a March employee action, we recognized severance costs associated with a  reduction in force (“RIF”) of $144 million, included in Compensation and benefits expenses. The RIF occurred across our business segments and geographic regions and impacted approximately 2% of our global workforce at that time. The RIF was related to performance management and the alignment of our workforce to our business needs, rather than a change in strategy or exit of businesses. We recorded severance costs of $78 million in the Institutional Securities business segment, $50 million in the Wealth Management business segment, and $16 million in the Investment Management business segment for the current quarter. These costs were incurred across all regions, with the majority in the Americas.
•
Non-compensation expenses of $4,539 million in the current quarter increased 12% from the prior year quarter, primarily due to higher execution-related expenses.
Provision for Credit Losses
The Provision for credit losses on loans and lending commitments of $135 million in the current quarter was primarily related to portfolio growth in secured lending facilities and corporate loans, provisions for certain specific loans, including residential real estate loans related to the California wildfires, and deterioration in the macroeconomic outlook. The macroeconomic outlook assumed in our ACL models and Provision for credit losses incorporated the weaker economic outlook and conditions as of March 31, 2025. The Provision for credit losses on loans and lending commitments in the prior year quarter was a net release of $6 million, primarily as a result of improvements in the macroeconomic outlook, partially offset by provisions for certain specific commercial real estate and corporate loans and modest growth in certain other loan portfolios.
For further information on the Provision for credit losses, see “Credit Risk” herein.

Selected Financial Information and Other Statistical Data
1.
The expense efficiency ratio represents total non-interest expenses as a percentage of net revenues.
2.
ROE and ROTCE represent annualized earnings applicable to Morgan Stanley common shareholders as a percentage of average common equity and average tangible common equity, respectively.
3.
Represents a non-GAAP financial measure. See “Selected Non-GAAP Financial Information” herein.
4.
Pre-tax margin represents income before provision for income taxes as a percentage of net revenues.
5.

9.
For a discussion of our capital ratios, see “Liquidity and Capital Resources—Regulatory Requirements” herein.
Economic and Market Conditions
The economic environment, client and investor confidence and overall market sentiment deteriorated in 2025, as recent developments around global trade and government policies resulted in increased economic uncertainty and market volatility. Geopolitical risks, inflation, as well as the timing and pace of central bank actions related to interest rates present ongoing risks to the economic environment and growth. These factors have impacted, and could continue to impact capital markets and our businesses, as discussed further in “Business Segments” herein.
For more information on economic and market conditions, and the potential effects of geopolitical events and acts of war or aggression on our future results, refer to “Risk Factors” and “Forward-Looking Statements” in the 2024 Form 10-K.
Selected Non-GAAP Financial Information
We prepare our financial statements using U.S. GAAP. From time to time, we may disclose certain “non-GAAP financial measures” in this document or in the course of our earnings releases, earnings and other conference calls, financial presentations, definitive proxy statements and other public disclosures. A “non-GAAP financial measure” excludes, or includes, amounts from the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We consider the non-GAAP financial measures we disclose to be useful to us, investors, analysts and other stakeholders by providing further transparency about, or an alternate means of assessing or comparing our financial condition, operating results and capital adequacy.
These measures are not in accordance with, or a substitute for, U.S. GAAP and may be different from or inconsistent with non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. Whenever we refer to a non-GAAP financial measure, we will also generally define it or present the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, along with a reconciliation of the differences between the U.S. GAAP financial measure and the non-GAAP financial measure.
We present certain non-GAAP financial measures that exclude the impact of mark-to-market gains and losses on DCP investments from net revenues and compensation expenses. The impact of DCP is primarily reflected in our Wealth Management business segment results. These measures allow for better comparability of period-to-period underlying operating performance and revenue trends, especially in our Wealth Management business segment. By excluding the impact of these items, we are better able to describe the business drivers and resulting impact to net revenues and corresponding change to the associated compensation expenses.
For additional information, see
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Other Matters” in the 2024 Form 10-K.
Tangible common equity is a non-GAAP financial measure that we believe analysts, investors and other stakeholders consider useful to allow for comparability to peers and of the period-to-period use of our equity. The calculation of tangible common equity represents common shareholders’ equity less goodwill and intangible assets net of allowable mortgage servicing rights deduction. In addition, we believe that certain ratios that utilize tangible common equity, such as return on average tangible common equity (“ROTCE”) and tangible book value per common share, also non-GAAP financial measures, are useful for evaluating the operating performance and capital adequacy of the business period-to-period, respectively. The calculation of ROTCE represents annualized earnings applicable to Morgan Stanley common shareholders as a percentage of average tangible common equity. The calculation of tangible book value per common share represents tangible common equity divided by common shares outstanding.
The principal non-GAAP financial measures presented in this document are set forth in the following tables.
Reconciliations from U.S. GAAP to Non-GAAP Consolidated Financial Measures
1.
Net revenues and compensation expense are adjusted for DCP for both Firm and Wealth Management business segment. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Other Matters” in the 2024 Form 10-K for more information.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures by Business Segment
1.
Average common equity and average tangible common equity for each business segment is determined using our Required Capital framework (see “Liquidity and Capital Resources—Regulatory Requirements—Attribution of Average Common Equity According to the Required Capital Framework” herein). The sums of the segments’ Average common equity and Average tangible common equity do not equal the Consolidated measures due to Parent Company equity.
2.
The calculation of ROE and ROTCE by segment uses net income applicable to Morgan Stanley by segment less preferred dividends allocated to each segment, annualized as a percentage of average common equity and average tangible common equity, respectively, allocated to each segment.
Return on Tangible Common Equity Goal
We have an ROTCE goal of 20%. Our ROTCE goal is a forward-looking statement that is based on a normal market environment and may be materially affected by many factors.
See “Risk Factors” and “Forward-Looking Statements” in the 2024 Form 10-K for further information on market and economic conditions and their potential effects on our future operating results.
ROTCE represents a non-GAAP financial measure. For further information on non-GAAP measures, see “Selected Non-GAAP Financial Information” herein.
Business Segments
Substantially all of our operating revenues and operating expenses are directly attributable to our business segments. Certain revenues and expenses have been allocated to each business segment, generally in proportion to its respective net revenues, non-interest expenses or other relevant measures. See Note 19 to the financial statements for segment net revenues by income statement line item and information on intersegment transactions.
For an overview of the components of our business segments, net revenues, provision for credit losses, compensation expense and income taxes, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Business Segments” in the 2024 Form 10-K.

Net New Assets
NNA represent client asset inflows, inclusive of interest, dividends and asset acquisitions, less client asset outflows, and exclude the impact of business combinations/divestitures and the impact of fees and commissions. The level of NNA in a given period is influenced by a variety of factors, including
macroeconomic factors that impact client investment and spending behaviors, seasonality, our ability to attract and retain financial advisors and clients, capital market and corporate activities which may impact the amount of assets in certain client channels, and large idiosyncratic inflows and outflows. These factors have had an impact on our NNA in recent periods. Should these factors continue, the growth rate of our NNA may be impacted.
Advisor-Led Channel

Net Revenues
Asset Management
Asset management revenues of $4,396 million in the current quarter increased 15% compared with the prior quarter, primarily reflecting higher fee-based assets due to higher
market levels and the cumulative impact of positive fee-based flows.
See “Fee-Based Client Assets Rollforwards” herein.
Transactional Revenues
Transactional revenues of $873 million in the current quarter  decreased 15% compared with the prior year quarter, primarily driven by losses on DCP investments compared with gains in the prior year quarter, partially offset by higher client activity particularly in equity-related transactions.
For further information on the impact of DCP, see “Selected Non-GAAP Financial Information” herein.
Net Interest
Net interest revenues of $1,902 million in the current quarter increased 2% compared with the prior year quarter, primarily due to lending growth and higher yields on the investment portfolio, partially offset by lower average sweep deposits.
The level and pace of interest rate changes and other macroeconomic factors have impacted client preferences for cash allocation to higher-yielding products and client demand for loans. These factors, along with other developments, such as pricing changes to certain deposit types due to various competitive dynamics, have impacted our net interest income. To the extent they persist, or other factors arise, such as central bank actions and changes in the path of interest rates, net interest income may be impacted in future periods.
Provision for Credit Losses
The Provision for credit losses on loans and lending commitments of $44 million in the current quarter was primarily related to certain specific loans, including residential real estate loans related to the California wildfires. The Provision for credit losses on loans and lending commitments was a net release of $8 million in the prior year quarter as a result of improvements in the macroeconomic outlook. This was partially offset by provisions for certain specific commercial real estate loans.
Non-Interest Expenses
Non-interest expenses of $5,332 million in the current quarter  increased 5% compared with the prior year quarter, primarily as a result of higher Compensation and benefits expenses.
•
Compensation and benefits expenses increased in the current quarter, primarily as a result of an increase in the formulaic payout to Wealth Management representatives on higher compensable revenues and higher severance costs associated with a RIF in March, partially offset by lower expenses related to DCP.
For further information on the impact of DCP, see “Selected Non-GAAP Financial Information” herein.
•
Non-compensation expenses were relatively unchanged compared with the prior year quarter.

Investment Management
Income Statement Information
1.
Includes Investments and Trading, Net interest, and Other revenues.
Net Revenues
Asset Management and Related Fees
Asset management and related fees of $1,451 million in the current quarter increased 8% from the prior year quarter, primarily driven by higher average AUM on higher market levels.
Asset management revenues are influenced by the level, relative mix of AUM and related fee rates. While higher market levels drove increases in average AUM in the current quarter, there were continued net outflows in the Equity asset class, which may be influenced by the structure and performance of our investment strategies and products relative to their benchmarks, offset by higher net inflows in the Alternatives and Solutions and Fixed Income asset classes reflecting client preferences. To the extent these conditions continue, we would expect our Asset management revenue to continue to be impacted.
See “Assets Under Management or Supervision” herein.
Performance-based Income and Other
Performance-based income and other revenues of $151 million in the current quarter increased from the prior year quarter, as a result of higher accrued carried interest in infrastructure funds.
Non-Interest Expenses
Non-interest expenses of $1,279 million in the current quarter increased 13% from the prior year quarter, as a result of higher Compensation and benefits expenses.
•
Compensation and benefits expenses increased in the current quarter, primarily due to higher compensation
associated with carried interest and higher severance costs associated with a RIF in March.
•
Non-compensation expenses increased in the current quarter, primarily due to higher distribution expenses on higher average AUM.

Supplemental Financial Information
U.S. Bank Subsidiaries
Our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries, Morgan Stanley Bank N.A. (“MSBNA”) and Morgan Stanley Private Bank, National Association (“MSPBNA”) (together, “U.S. Bank Subsidiaries”), accept deposits, provide loans to a variety of customers, including large corporate and institutional clients, as well as high to ultra-high net worth individuals, and invest in securities. Lending activity in our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries from the Institutional Securities business segment primarily includes Secured lending facilities, Commercial and Residential real estate and Corporate loans. Lending activity in our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries from the Wealth Management business segment primarily includes Securities-based lending, which allows clients to borrow money against the value of qualifying securities, and Residential real estate loans.

Accounting Development Updates
The Financial Accounting Standards Board has issued certain accounting updates that apply to us. Accounting updates not referenced below were assessed and determined to be either not applicable or to not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations upon adoption.
We continue to evaluate accounting updates disclosed in the “Accounting Development Updates” section of the 2024 Form 10-K, including the implementation of the Income Tax Disclosures accounting update, and do not expect a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations upon adoption.
Critical Accounting Estimates
Our financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which requires us to make estimates and assumptions (see Note 1 to the financial statements). We believe that of our significant accounting policies (see Note 2 to the financial statements in the 2024 Form 10-K and Note 2 to the financial statements), the fair value of financial instruments, goodwill and intangible assets, legal and regulatory contingencies (see Note 14 to the financial statements in the 2024 Form 10-K and Note 13 to the financial statements) and income taxes policies involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity. For a further discussion about our critical accounting policies, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Critical Accounting Estimates” in the 2024 Form 10-K.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Our liquidity and capital policies are established and maintained by senior management, with oversight by the Asset/Liability Management Committee and our Board of Directors (“Board”). Through various risk and control committees, senior management reviews business performance relative to these policies, monitors the availability of alternative sources of financing, and oversees the liquidity, interest rate and currency sensitivity of our asset and liability position. Our Corporate Treasury department (“Treasury”), Firm Risk Committee, Asset/Liability Management Committee, and other committees and control groups assist in evaluating, monitoring and managing the impact that our business activities have on our balance sheet, liquidity and capital structure. Liquidity and capital matters are reported regularly to the Board and the Risk Committee of the Board.
Balance Sheet
We monitor and evaluate the composition and size of our balance sheet on a regular basis. Our balance sheet management process includes quarterly planning, business-specific thresholds, monitoring of business-specific usage versus key performance metrics and new business impact assessments.
We establish balance sheet thresholds at the consolidated and business segment levels. We monitor balance sheet utilization and review variances resulting from business activity and market fluctuations. On a regular basis, we review current performance versus established thresholds and assess the need to re-allocate our balance sheet based on business segment
needs. We also monitor key metrics, including asset and liability size and capital usage.
Total Assets by Business Segment
1.
Amounts include loans held for investment, net of ACL, and loans held for sale but exclude loans at fair value, which are included in Trading assets in the balance sheet (see Note 9 to the financial statements).
2.
Other assets primarily includes premises, equipment and software, ROU assets related to leases, other investments, and deferred tax assets.
A substantial portion of total assets consists of cash and cash equivalents, liquid marketable securities and short-term receivables. In the Institutional Securities business segment, these arise from market-making, financing and prime brokerage activities, and in the Wealth Management business segment, these arise from banking activities, including management of the investment portfolio.
Liquidity Risk Management Framework
The core components of our Liquidity Risk Management Framework are the Required Liquidity Framework, Liquidity Stress Tests and Liquidity Resources, which support our target liquidity profile. For a further discussion about the Firm’s Required Liquidity Framework and Liquidity Stress Tests, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Liquidity Risk Management Framework” in the 2024 Form 10-K.
At March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, we maintained sufficient liquidity to meet current and contingent funding obligations as modeled in our Liquidity Stress Tests.
Liquidity Resources
We maintain sufficient liquidity resources, which consist of HQLA and cash deposits with banks (“Liquidity Resources”), to cover daily funding needs and to meet strategic liquidity targets sized by the Required Liquidity Framework and Liquidity Stress Tests. We actively manage the amount of our Liquidity Resources considering the following components: unsecured debt maturity profile; balance sheet size and composition; funding needs in a stressed environment, inclusive of contingent cash outflows; legal entity, regional and segment liquidity requirements; regulatory requirements; and collateral requirements.
The amount of Liquidity Resources we hold is based on our risk appetite and is calibrated to meet various internal and regulatory requirements and to fund prospective business activities. The Liquidity Resources are primarily held within the Parent Company and its major operating subsidiaries. The Total HQLA values in the tables immediately following are different from Eligible HQLA, which, in accordance with the LCR rule, also takes into account certain regulatory weightings and other operational considerations.
Liquidity Resources by Type of Investment
1.
HQLA is presented prior to applying weightings and includes all HQLA held in subsidiaries.
2.
Primarily composed of unencumbered French, U.K., Japanese, Italian, German, and Spanish government obligations.
Liquidity Resources by Non-Bank and Bank Legal Entities
Liquidity Resources may fluctuate from period to period based on the overall size and composition of our balance sheet, the maturity profile of our unsecured debt, and estimates of funding needs in a stressed environment, among other factors.
Regulatory Liquidity Framework
Liquidity Coverage Ratio and Net Stable Funding Ratio
We and our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries are required to maintain a minimum LCR and NSFR of 100%.
The LCR rule requires large banking organizations to have sufficient Eligible HQLA to cover net cash outflows arising from significant stress over 30 calendar days, thus promoting the short-term resilience of the liquidity risk profile of banking organizations. In determining Eligible HQLA for LCR purposes, weightings (or asset haircuts) are applied to HQLA, and certain HQLA held in subsidiaries is excluded.
The NSFR rule requires large banking organizations to maintain an amount of available stable funding, which is their regulatory capital and liabilities subject to standardized weightings, equal to or greater than their required stable funding, which is their projected minimum funding needs, over a one-year time horizon.
As of March 31, 2025, we and our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries are compliant with the minimum LCR and NSFR requirements of 100%.
Liquidity Coverage Ratio
1.
Primarily includes U.S. Treasuries, U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities, sovereign bonds and investment grade corporate bonds.
Funding Management
We manage our funding in a manner that reduces the risk of disruption to our operations. We pursue a strategy of diversification of secured and unsecured funding sources (by product, investor and region) and attempt to ensure that the tenor of our liabilities equals or exceeds the expected holding period of the assets being financed. Our goal is to achieve an optimal mix of durable secured and unsecured financing.
We fund our balance sheet on a global basis through diverse sources. These sources include our equity capital, borrowings, bank notes, securities sold under agreements to repurchase, securities lending, deposits, letters of credit and lines of credit. We have active financing programs for both standard and structured products targeting global investors and currencies.
Treasury allocates interest expense to our businesses based on the tenor and interest rate profile of the assets being funded. Treasury similarly allocates interest income to businesses carrying deposit products and other liabilities across the businesses based on the characteristics of those deposits and other liabilities.
Secured Financing
For a discussion of our secured financing activities, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Funding Management—Secured Financing” in the 2024 Form 10-K.
Collateralized Financing Transactions
1.
Included within Trading assets in the balance sheet.
See “Total Assets by Business Segment” herein for additional information on the assets shown in the previous table and Note 2 to the financial statements in the 2024 Form 10-K and Note 8 to the financial statements for additional information on collateralized financing transactions.
In addition to the collateralized financing transactions shown in the previous table, we engage in financing transactions collateralized by customer-owned securities, which are segregated in accordance with regulatory requirements. Receivables under these financing transactions, primarily margin loans, are included in Customer and other receivables in the balance sheet, and payables under these financing transactions, primarily to prime brokerage customers, are included in Customer and other payables in the balance sheet. Our risk exposure on these transactions is mitigated by collateral maintenance policies and the elements of our Liquidity Risk Management Framework.
Unsecured Financing
For a discussion of our unsecured financing activities, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Funding Management—Unsecured Financing” in the 2024 Form 10-K.
Deposits
1.
Amounts represent balances swept from client brokerage accounts.
2.
Our Time deposits are predominantly brokered certificates of deposit.
3.
Our deposits are primarily held in U.S. offices.
Deposits are primarily sourced from our Wealth Management clients and are considered to have stable, low-cost funding characteristics relative to other sources of funding. Each category of deposits presented above has a different cost profile and clients may respond differently to changes in interest rates and other macroeconomic conditions. Total deposits in the current quarter increased primarily due to increases in Savings and Time Deposits, partially offset by a reduction in Brokerage sweep deposits, largely due to net outflows to alternative cash equivalent and other investment products.
Borrowings by Maturity at March 31, 2025
1
1.
Original maturity in the table is generally based on contractual final maturity. For borrowings with put options, maturity represents the earliest put date.
2.
Includes only borrowings with original maturities greater than one year.
Borrowings of $305 billion as of March 31, 2025 increased compared with $289 billion at December 31, 2024, primarily due to issuances net of maturities and redemptions.
We believe that accessing debt investors through multiple distribution channels helps provide consistent access to the unsecured markets. In addition, the issuance of borrowings with original maturities greater than one year allows us to reduce reliance on short-term credit-sensitive instruments. Borrowings with original maturities greater than one year are generally managed to achieve staggered maturities, thereby mitigating refinancing risk, and to maximize investor diversification through sales to global institutional and retail clients across regions, currencies and product types.
The availability and cost of financing to us can vary depending on market conditions, the volume of certain trading and lending activities, our credit ratings and the overall availability of credit. We also engage in, and may continue to engage in, repurchases of our borrowings as part of our market-making activities.
For further information on Borrowings, see Note 12 to the financial statements.
Credit Ratings
We rely on external sources to finance a significant portion of our daily operations. Our credit ratings are one of the factors in the cost and availability of financing and can have an impact on certain trading revenues, particularly in those businesses where longer-term counterparty performance is a key consideration, such as certain OTC derivative transactions. When determining credit ratings, rating agencies consider both company-specific and industry-wide factors. See also “Risk Factors—Liquidity Risk” in the 2024 Form 10-K.
Parent Company and U.S. Bank Subsidiaries Issuer Ratings at April 30, 2025
Incremental Collateral or Terminating Payments
In connection with certain OTC derivatives and certain other agreements where we are a liquidity provider to certain financing vehicles associated with the Institutional Securities business segment, we may be required to provide additional collateral, immediately settle any outstanding liability balances with certain counterparties or pledge additional collateral to certain clearing organizations in the event of a future credit rating downgrade irrespective of whether we are in a net asset or net liability position. See Note 6 to the financial statements for additional information on OTC derivatives that contain such contingent features.
While certain aspects of a credit rating downgrade are quantifiable pursuant to contractual provisions, the impact it would have on our business and results of operations in future periods is inherently uncertain and would depend on a number of interrelated factors, including, among other things, the magnitude of the downgrade, the rating relative to peers, the rating assigned by the relevant agency before the downgrade, individual client behavior and future mitigating actions we might take. The liquidity impact of additional collateral requirements is included in our Liquidity Stress Tests.
Capital Management
We view capital as an important source of financial strength and actively manage our consolidated capital position based upon, among other things, business opportunities, risks, capital availability and rates of return together with internal capital policies, regulatory requirements, such as the SCB, and rating agency guidelines. In the future, we may expand or contract our capital base to address the changing needs of our businesses.

For additional information on our common stock and information on our preferred stock, see Note 16 to the financial statements.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We enter into various off-balance sheet arrangements, including through unconsolidated SPEs and lending-related financial instruments (e.g., guarantees and commitments), primarily in connection with the Institutional Securities and Investment Management business segments.
We utilize SPEs primarily in connection with securitization activities. For information on our securitization activities, see Note 15 to the financial statements in the 2024 Form 10-K.
For information on our commitments, obligations under certain guarantee arrangements and indemnities, see Note 13 to the financial statements. For a further discussion of our lending commitments, see “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Risk—Credit Risk—Loans and Lending Commitments” herein.
Regulatory Requirements
Regulatory Capital Framework
We are a financial holding company (“FHC”) under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (“BHC Act”) and are subject to the regulation and oversight of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (“Federal Reserve”). The Federal Reserve establishes capital requirements for us, including “well-capitalized” standards, and evaluates our compliance with such capital requirements. The OCC establishes similar capital requirements and
standards for our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries. The regulatory capital requirements are largely based on the Basel III capital standards established by the Basel Committee and also implement certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. For us to remain an FHC, we must remain well-capitalized in accordance with standards established by the Federal Reserve, and our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries must remain well-capitalized in accordance with standards established by the OCC. In addition, many of our regulated subsidiaries are subject to regulatory capital requirements, including regulated subsidiaries registered as swap dealers with the CFTC or conditionally registered as security-based swap dealers with the SEC or registered as broker-dealers or futures commission merchants. For additional information on regulatory capital requirements for our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries, as well as our subsidiaries that are swap entities, see Note 15 to the financial statements.
Regulatory Capital Requirements
We are required to maintain minimum risk-based and leverage-based capital and TLAC ratios. For more information, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Regulatory Capital Requirements” in the 2024 Form 10-K. For additional information on TLAC, see “Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity, Long-Term Debt and Clean Holding Company Requirements” herein.
Risk-Based Regulatory Capital.
Risk-based capital ratio requirements apply to Common Equity Tier 1 (“CET1”) capital, Tier 1 capital and Total capital (which includes Tier 2 capital), each as a percentage of RWA, and consist of regulatory minimum required ratios plus our capital buffer requirement. Capital requirements require certain adjustments to, and deductions from, capital for purposes of determining these ratios.
Risk-Based Regulatory Capital Ratio Requirements
1.
For additional information on the SCB, see “Capital Plans, Stress Tests and the Stress Capital Buffer” herein and in the 2024 Form 10-K.
2.
For a further discussion of the G-SIB capital surcharge, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Regulatory Requirements—G-SIB Capital Surcharge” in the 2024 Form 10-K.
3.
The CCyB can be set up to 2.5%, but is currently set by the Federal Reserve at zero.
The capital buffer requirement represents the amount of CET1 capital we must maintain above the minimum risk-based capital requirements in order to avoid restrictions on our ability to make capital distributions, including the payment of dividends and the repurchase of stock, and to pay
discretionary bonuses to executive officers. Our capital buffer requirement computed under the standardized approaches for calculating credit risk and market RWAs (“Standardized Approach”) is equal to the sum of our SCB, G-SIB capital surcharge and CCyB, and our capital buffer requirement computed under the applicable advanced approaches for calculating credit risk, market risk and operational risk RWAs (“Advanced Approach”) is equal to our 2.5% capital conservation buffer, G-SIB capital surcharge and CCyB.
1.
Required ratios represent the regulatory minimum plus the capital buffer requirement.
Our risk-based capital ratios are computed under each of (i) the Standardized Approach and (ii) the Advanced Approach. The credit risk RWA calculations between the two approaches differ in that the Standardized Approach requires calculation of RWA using prescribed risk weights and exposure methodologies, whereas the Advanced Approach utilizes models to calculate exposure amounts and risk weights. At March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, the differences between the actual and required ratios were lower under the Standardized Approach.
Leverage-Based Regulatory Capital.
Leverage-based capital requirements include a minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4%, a minimum SLR of 3% and an enhanced SLR capital buffer of at least 2%.
CECL Deferral.
Beginning on January 1, 2020, we elected to defer the effect of the adoption of CECL on our risk-based and leverage-based capital amounts and ratios, as well as our RWA, adjusted average assets and supplementary leverage exposure calculations, over a five-year transition period. The deferral impacts began to phase in at 25% per year from January 1, 2022, were phased-in at 75% from January 1, 2024 and were fully phased-in from January 1, 2025.
Regulatory Capital Ratios
Risk-based capital
1.
Required ratios are inclusive of any buffers applicable as of the date presented.
Leveraged-based capital
1.
Adjusted average assets represents the denominator of the Tier 1 leverage ratio and is composed of the average daily balance of consolidated on-balance sheet assets for the quarters ending on the respective balance sheet dates, reduced by disallowed goodwill, intangible assets, investments in covered funds, defined benefit pension plan assets, after-tax gain on sale from assets sold into securitizations, investments in our own capital instruments, certain deferred tax assets and other capital deductions.
2.
Supplementary leverage exposure is the sum of Adjusted average assets used in the Tier 1 leverage ratio and other adjustments, primarily: (i) for derivatives, potential future exposure and the effective notional principal amount of sold credit protection offset by qualifying purchased credit protection; (ii) the counterparty credit risk for repo-style transactions; and (iii) the credit equivalent amount for off-balance sheet exposures.
3.
Required ratios are inclusive of any buffers applicable as of the date presented.
Regulatory Capital
1.
Other adjustments and deductions used in the calculation of CET1  capital primarily includes net after-tax DVA, the credit spread premium over risk-free rate for derivative liabilities, defined benefit pension plan assets, after-tax gain on sale from assets sold into securitizations, investments in our own capital instruments and certain deferred tax assets.
RWA Rollforward
Regulatory VaR—VaR for regulatory capital requirements
In the current quarter, Credit risk RWA increased under both the Standardized and Advanced Approaches. Under the Standardized Approach, the increase was primarily due to higher Securities financing transactions, Derivatives exposures, Other credit risk driven by higher deferred tax assets and securitizations, and growth in lending. Under the Advanced Approach, the increase was primarily due to higher Derivatives exposures, Securities financing transactions and Other credit risk driven by higher deferred tax assets and securitizations, partially offset by decreased Corporate lending commitments.
Market risk RWA increased in the current quarter under both the Standardized and Advanced Approaches, primarily driven by higher charges on Specific risk, and higher Regulatory Stressed VaR and Regulatory VaR, partially offset by decreased charges on incremental risk.
The decrease in Operational risk RWA in the current quarter is related to lower execution-related losses.
Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity, Long-Term Debt and Clean Holding Company Requirements
The Federal Reserve has established external TLAC, long-term debt (“LTD”) and clean holding company requirements for top-tier BHCs of U.S. G-SIBs (“covered BHCs”), including the Parent Company. These requirements are designed to ensure that covered BHCs will have enough loss-
absorbing resources at the point of failure to be recapitalized through the conversion of eligible LTD to equity or otherwise by imposing losses on eligible LTD or other forms of TLAC where an SPOE resolution strategy is used.
Required and Actual TLAC and Eligible LTD Ratios
1.
Required ratios are inclusive of applicable buffers.
2.
External TLAC consists of CET1 capital and Additional Tier 1 capital (each excluding any noncontrolling minority interests), as well as eligible LTD.
3.
Consists of TLAC-eligible LTD reduced by 50% for amounts of unpaid principal due to be paid in more than one year but less than two years from each respective balance sheet date.
We are in compliance with all TLAC requirements as of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024.
For a further discussion of TLAC and related requirements, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Regulatory Requirements—Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity, Long-Term Debt and Clean Holding Company Requirements” in the 2024 Form 10-K.
Capital Plans, Stress Tests and the Stress Capital Buffer
The Federal Reserve has capital planning and stress test requirements for large BHCs, which form part of the Federal Reserve’s annual CCAR framework.
We must submit, on at least an annual basis, a capital plan to the Federal Reserve, taking into account the results of separate annual stress tests designed by us and the Federal Reserve, so that the Federal Reserve may assess our systems and processes that incorporate forward-looking projections of revenues and losses to monitor and maintain our internal capital adequacy. As banks with less than $250 billion of total assets, our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries are not subject to company-run stress test regulatory requirements.
As part of its annual capital supervisory stress testing process, the Federal Reserve determines an SCB for each large BHC, including us.
Our SCB will remain at 6.0% through September 30, 2025. Together with other features of the regulatory capital framework, this SCB resulted in an aggregate Standardized Approach Common Equity Tier 1 required ratio of 13.5%.
For the 2025 capital planning and stress test cycle, we submitted our capital plan and company-run stress test results
to the Federal Reserve on April 7, 2025. The Federal Reserve is expected to publish summary results of the CCAR and Dodd-Frank Act supervisory stress tests of each large BHC, including us, by June 30, 2025. We are required to disclose a summary of the results of our company-run stress tests within 15 days of the date the Federal Reserve discloses the results of the supervisory stress tests.
For additional information, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Regulatory Requirements—Capital Plans, Stress Tests and the Stress Capital Buffer” in the 2024 Form 10-K.
Attribution of Average Common Equity According to the Required Capital Framework
Our required capital (“Required Capital”) estimation is based on the Required Capital framework, an internal capital adequacy measure. Common equity attribution to the business segments is based on capital usage calculated under the Required Capital framework, as well as each business segment’s relative contribution to our total Required Capital.
The Required Capital framework is a risk-based and leverage-based capital measure, which is compared with our regulatory capital to ensure that we maintain an amount of going concern capital after absorbing potential losses from stress events, where applicable, at a point in time. The amount of capital allocated to the business segments is generally set at the beginning of each year and remains fixed throughout the year until the next annual reset unless a significant business change occurs (
e.g
., acquisition or disposition). We define the difference between our total average common equity and the sum of the average common equity amounts allocated to our business segments as Parent Company common equity. We generally hold Parent Company common equity for prospective regulatory requirements, organic growth, potential future acquisitions and other capital needs.
Average Common Equity Attribution under the Required Capital Framework
1
1.
The attribution of average common equity to the business segments is a non-GAAP financial measure. See “Selected Non-GAAP Financial Information” herein.
We continue to evaluate our Required Capital framework with respect to the impact of evolving regulatory requirements, as appropriate.
Resolution and Recovery Planning
We are required to submit once every two years to the Federal Reserve and the FDIC (“Agencies”) a resolution plan that describes our strategy for a rapid and orderly resolution under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in the event of our material financial distress or failure. Our next resolution plan submission is due in July 2025.
As described in our most recent resolution plan, our preferred resolution strategy is an SPOE strategy, which would impose losses on the holders of eligible LTD and other forms of eligible TLAC issued by the Parent Company before any losses are imposed on creditors of our supported entities and without requiring taxpayer or government financial support.
For more information about resolution and recovery planning requirements and our activities in these areas, including the implications of such activities in a resolution scenario, see “Business—Supervision and Regulation—Financial Holding Company—Resolution and Recovery Planning,” “Risk Factors—Legal, Regulatory and Compliance Risk” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Regulatory Requirements—Resolution and Recovery Planning” in the 2024 Form 10-K.
Regulatory Developments and Other Matters
Proposed Changes to Capital Requirements
On April 17, 2025, the Federal Reserve proposed revisions to the SCB and CCAR frameworks applicable to us, aimed at reducing the volatility of the capital requirements stemming from the Federal Reserve’s annual stress test results. Under the proposal, our SCB would be based, in part, on the average of the post-stress capital decline embedded in the Federal Reserve’s stress test results over two consecutive years
. Additionally, the proposal would shift the annual effective date of the revised SCB from
October 1 to January 1 of the following year and modify certain elements of the Federal Reserve’s CCAR program.
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Risk
Management believes effective risk management is vital to the success of our business activities. For a discussion of our Enterprise Risk Management framework and risk management functions, see “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Risk—Risk Management” in the 2024 Form 10-K.
Market Risk
Market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, rates, spreads, indices, volatilities, correlations or other market factors, such as market liquidity, will result in losses for a position or portfolio. Generally, we incur market risk as a result of trading, investing and client facilitation activities, principally within the Institutional Securities business segment where the substantial majority of our VaR for market risk exposures is generated. In addition, we incur non-trading market risk, principally within the Wealth Management and Investment Management business segments. The Wealth Management business segment primarily incurs non-trading market risk (including interest rate risk) from lending and deposit-taking activities. The Investment Management business segment primarily incurs non-trading market risk from capital investments in its funds. For a further discussion of market risk, see “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Risk—Market Risk” in the 2024 Form 10-K.
Trading Risks
We have exposures to a wide range of risks related to interest rates and credit spreads, equity prices, foreign exchange rates and commodity prices as well as the associated implied volatilities, correlations and spreads of the global markets in which we conduct our trading activities.
The statistical technique known as VaR is one of the tools we use to measure, monitor and review the market risk exposures of our trading portfolios.
For information regarding our primary risk exposures and market risk management, VaR methodology, assumptions and limitations, see “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Risk—Market Risk—Trading Risks” in the 2024 Form 10-K.
95%/One-Day Management VaR for the Trading Portfolio
1.
The high and low VaR values for the Total Management VaR and each of the component VaRs might have occurred on different days during the quarter, and, therefore, the diversification benefit is not an applicable measure.
2.
Diversification benefit equals the difference between the total VaR and the sum of the component VaRs. This benefit arises because the simulated one-day losses for each of the components occur on different days. Similar diversification benefits are also taken into account within each component.
Average Total Management VaR and average Management VaR for the Primary Risk Categories increased from the three months ended December 31, 2024, primarily driven by increased exposure in credit spread risk category and higher market volatility.
Distribution of VaR Statistics and Net Revenues
We evaluate the reasonableness of our VaR model by comparing the potential declines in portfolio values generated by the model with corresponding actual trading results for the Firm, as well as individual business units. For days where losses exceed the VaR statistic, we examine the drivers of trading losses to evaluate the VaR model’s accuracy. There was one trading loss day in the current quarter, which did not exceed 95% Total Management VaR.
Daily 95%/One-Day Total Management VaR for the Current Quarter
($ in millions)
Daily Net Trading Revenues for the Current Quarter
($ in millions)
Daily net trading revenues include profits and losses from Interest rate and credit spread, Equity price, Foreign exchange rate, Commodity price, and Credit Portfolio positions and intraday trading activities for our trading businesses. Certain items such as fees, commissions, net interest income and counterparty default risk are excluded from daily net trading revenues and the VaR model. Revenues required for Regulatory VaR backtesting further exclude intraday trading.
Non-Trading Risks
We believe that sensitivity analysis is an appropriate representation of our non-trading risks. The following sensitivity analyses cover substantially all of the non-trading market risk in our portfolio.
Credit Spread Risk Sensitivity
1
1.
Amounts represent the potential gain for each 1 bps widening of our credit spread.
The Wealth Management business segment reflects a substantial portion of our non-trading interest rate risk. Net interest income in the Wealth Management business segment primarily consists of interest income earned on non-trading assets held, including loans and investment securities, as well as margin and other lending on non-bank entities and interest expense incurred on non-trading liabilities, primarily deposits.
Wealth Management Net Interest Income Sensitivity Analysis
The previous table presents an analysis of selected instantaneous upward and downward parallel interest rate shocks (subject to a floor of zero percent in the downward scenario) on net interest income over the next 12 months for our Wealth Management business segment. These shocks are applied to our 12-month forecast for our Wealth Management business segment, which incorporates market expectations of interest rates and our forecasted balance sheet and business activity. The forecast includes modeled prepayment behavior, reinvestment of net cash flows from maturing assets and liabilities, and deposit pricing sensitivity to interest rates. These key assumptions are updated periodically based on historical data and future expectations.
We do not manage to any single rate scenario but rather manage net interest income in our Wealth Management business segment across a range of possible outcomes, including non-parallel rate change scenarios. The sensitivity analysis assumes that we take no action in response to these scenarios, assumes there are no changes in other macroeconomic variables normally correlated with changes in interest rates and includes subjective assumptions regarding customer and market re-pricing behavior and other factors.
Our Wealth Management business segment balance sheet is asset sensitive, given assets reprice faster than liabilities,
resulting in higher net interest income in higher interest rate scenarios and lower net interest income in lower interest rate scenarios. The level of interest rates may impact the amount of deposits held at the Firm, given competition for deposits from other institutions and alternative cash-equivalent products available to depositors. Further, the level of interest rates could also impact client demand for loans.
Net interest income sensitivity to interest rates at March 31, 2025 decreased from December 31, 2024, primarily driven by the effects of changes in the mix of our assets and liabilities and changes in market rates.
Investments Sensitivity, Including Related Carried Interest
We have exposure to public and private companies through direct investments, as well as through funds that invest in these assets. These investments are predominantly equity positions with long investment horizons, a portion of which is for business facilitation purposes. The market risk related to these investments is measured by estimating the potential reduction in net revenues associated with a reasonably possible 10% decline in investment values and related impact on performance-based income, as applicable. The measures reflected in the table above do not reflect the effect of any economic hedges or diversification that may reduce the risk of loss.
Asset Management Revenue Sensitivity
Certain asset management revenues in the Wealth Management and Investment Management business segments are derived from management fees, which are based on fee-based client assets in Wealth Management or AUM in Investment Management (together, “client holdings”). The assets underlying client holdings are primarily composed of equity, fixed income and alternative investments and are sensitive to changes in related markets. These revenues depend on multiple factors including, but not limited to, the level and duration of a market increase or decline, price volatility, the geographic and industry mix of client assets, and client behavior such as the rate and magnitude of client investments and redemptions. Therefore, overall revenues may not correlate completely with changes in the related markets.
Credit Risk
Credit risk refers to the risk of loss arising when a borrower, counterparty or issuer does not meet its financial obligations to us. We are primarily exposed to credit risk from institutions and individuals through our Institutional Securities and Wealth Management business segments. For a further discussion of our credit risks, see “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Risk—Credit Risk” in the 2024 Form 10-K.
Loans and Lending Commitments
Total exposure—consists of Total loans, net of ACL, and Lending commitments
1.
FVO includes the fair value of certain unfunded lending commitments.
2.
Investment Management business segment loans are related to certain of our activities as an investment adviser and manager. Loans held at fair value are the result of the consolidation of investment vehicles (including CLOs) managed by Investment Management, composed primarily of senior secured loans to corporations.
3.
Lending commitments represent the notional amount of legally binding obligations to provide funding to clients for lending transactions. Since commitments associated with these business activities may expire unused or may not be utilized to full capacity, they do not necessarily reflect the actual future cash funding requirements.
We provide loans and lending commitments to a variety of customers, including large corporate and institutional clients, as well as high to ultra-high net worth individuals. In addition, we purchase loans in the secondary market. Loans and lending commitments are either held for investment, held for sale or carried at fair value. For more information on these loan classifications, see Note 2 to the financial statements in the 2024 Form 10-K.
Total loans and lending commitments increased by approximately $16 billion since December 31, 2024, primarily due to an increase in Secured lending facilities and Corporate lending within the Institutional Securities business segment and growth in Securities-based loans within the Wealth Management business segment.
See Notes 4, 5, 9 and 13 to the financial statements for further information.
Allowance for Credit Losses—Loans and Lending Commitments
Provision for Credit Losses by Business Segment
Credit exposure arising from our loans and lending commitments is measured in accordance with our internal risk management standards. Risk factors considered in determining the allowance for credit losses for loans and lending commitments include the borrower’s financial strength, industry, facility structure, LTV ratio, debt service ratio, collateral and covenants. Qualitative and environmental factors such as economic and business conditions, nature and volume of the portfolio and lending terms, and volume and severity of past due loans may also be considered.
The allowance for credit losses for loans and lending commitments increased since December 31, 2024, primarily related to portfolio growth in secured lending facilities and corporate loans, provisions for certain specific loans, including residential real estate loans related to the California wildfires, and deterioration in the macroeconomic outlook. Charge-offs in the current quarter were primarily related to commercial real estate loans.
The base scenario used in our ACL models as of March 31, 2025 was generated using a combination of consensus economic forecasts, forward rates, and internally developed and validated models. This scenario assumes slower economic growth as well as higher interest rates relative to the prior quarter forecast. The revised real GDP growth rates assumed in our ACL models incorporated the weaker economic outlook and conditions as of March 31, 2025. The ACL calculation incorporates key macroeconomic variables, including U.S. real GDP growth rate. The significance of key macroeconomic variables on the ACL calculation varies depending on portfolio composition and economic conditions.
Forecasted U.S. Real GDP Growth Rates in Base Scenario
Other key macroeconomic variables used in the ACL calculation include corporate credit spreads, interest rates and commercial real estate indices. See Note 2 to the financial statements in the 2024 Form 10-K for a discussion of the Firm’s ACL methodology under CECL.
Recent developments around global trade policies have the potential to adversely impact our credit portfolios. The magnitude of such impacts, as well as the implications for global growth, will depend on specific details of how global trade policies evolve and also how effectively our clients adapt. While we are carefully monitoring all of our exposures, certain types of borrowers and counterparties are more vulnerable to trade policy effects. There remains significant uncertainty as to how trade policies will evolve; therefore, the borrowers and counterparties impacted may change over time.

Unrated loans and lending commitments are primarily trading positions that are measured at fair value and risk-managed as a component of market risk. For a further discussion of our market risk, see “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Risk—Market Risk” herein.
Institutional Securities Loans and Lending Commitments by Industry
Institutional Securities Lending Activities
The Institutional Securities business segment lending activities include Corporate, Secured lending facilities, Commercial and Residential real estate, and Securities-based lending and Other. As of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, over 90% of our Institutional Securities total exposure, which consisted of loans and lending commitments, was investment grade and/or secured by collateral. For a description of Institutional Securities’ lending activities, see “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Risk—Credit Risk” in the 2024 Form 10-K.
Institutional Securities Event-Driven Loans and Lending Commitments
Event-driven loans and lending commitments are associated with certain underwritings and/or syndications to finance a specific transaction, such as merger, acquisition, recapitalization or project finance activities. Balances may fluctuate as such lending is related to transactions that vary in timing and size from period to period.
Institutional Securities Loans and Lending Commitments Held for Investment
Institutional Securities Commercial Real Estate Loans and Lending Commitments
By Region
By Property Type
LC–Lending Commitments
1. Amounts include HFI, HFS and FVO loans and lending commitments. HFI loans are presented net of ACL.
The current economic environment and changes in business and consumer behavior have adversely impacted commercial real estate borrowers due to pressure from higher interest rates, tenant lease renewals, and elevated refinancing risks for loans with near-term maturities, among other issues. While we continue to actively monitor all our loan portfolios, the commercial real estate sector remains under heightened focus given the sector’s sensitivity to economic and secular factors, credit conditions, and difficulties specific to certain property types, most notably office.
As of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024
, our lending against commercial real estate (“CRE”) properties within the Institutional Securities business segment totaled $9.9 billion and $10.7 billion, respectively. This represents 3.9% and 4.4%, respectively, of total exposure reflected in the Institutional Securities Loans and Lending Commitments table above. Those CRE loans are originated for experienced sponsors and are generally secured by specific institutional CRE properties. In many cases, loans are subsequently syndicated or s
ecuritized on a full or partial basis, reducing our ongoing exposure.
In addition to the amounts included in the table above, we provide certain secured lending facilities which are typically collateralized by pooled CRE mortgage loans and are included in Secured lending facilities in the Institutional Securities Loans and Lending Commitments Held for Investment table above. These secured lending facilities benefit from structural protections including cross-collateralization and diversification across property types.

Amounts include HFI loans and lending commitments. HFI loans are presented net of ACL.
As of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024
, our direct lending against CRE properties totaled $7.8 billion and $7.7 billion, respectively, within the Wealth Management business segment. This represents 4.3% and
4.3%
, respectively, of total exposure reflected in the Wealth Management Loans and Lending Commitments
table above, primarily included within Securities-based lending and Other loans. Such loans are originated through our p
rivate banking platform, are both secured and generally benefiting from full or partial guarantees from high or ultra-high net worth clients, which partially reduce associated credit risk. At both March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, greater than 95% of the CRE loans balance in the Wealth Management business segment
received gua
rantees. All of our lending against CRE properties within Wealth Management are in the Americas region.
Wealth Management Allowance for Credit Losses—Loans and Lending Commitments
As of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, more than 75% of Wealth Management residential real estate loans were to borrowers with “Exceptional” or “Very Good” FICO scores (
i.e.,
exceeding 740). Additionally, Wealth Management’s securities-based lending portfolio remains well-collateralized and subject to daily client margining, which includes requiring customers to deposit additional collateral or reduce debt positions, when necessary.
Customer and Other Receivables
Margin Loans and Other Lending
The Institutional Securities and Wealth Management business segments provide margin lending arrangements that allow customers to borrow against the value of qualifying securities, primarily for the purpose of purchasing additional securities, as well as to collateralize short positions. Institutional Securities primarily includes margin loans in the Equity Financing business. Wealth Management includes margin loans as well as non-purpose securities-based lending on non-bank entities. Amounts may fluctuate from period to period as overall client balances change as a result of market levels, client positioning and leverage.
Credit exposures arising from margin lending activities are generally mitigated by their short-term nature, the value of collateral held and our right to call for additional margin when collateral values decline. However, we could incur losses in the event that the customer fails to meet margin calls and collateral values decline below the loan amount. This risk is elevated in loans backed by collateral pools with significant concentrations in individual issuers or securities with similar risk characteristics. For a further discussion, see “Risk Factors—Credit Risk” in the 2024 Form 10-K.
Employee Loans
For information on employee loans and related ACL, see Note 9 to the financial statements.
Derivatives
Fair Value of OTC Derivative Assets
1.
Counterparty credit ratings are determined internally by the CRM.
We are exposed to credit risk as a dealer in OTC derivatives. Credit risk with respect to derivative instruments arises from the possibility that a counterparty may fail to perform according to the terms of the contract. For more information on derivatives, see “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Risk—Credit Risk—Derivatives” in the 2024 Form 10-K and Note 6 to the financial statements.
Country Risk
Country risk exposure is the risk that events in, or that affect, a foreign country (any country other than the U.S.) might adversely affect us. We actively manage country risk exposure through a comprehensive risk management framework that combines credit and other market fundamentals and allows us to effectively identify, monitor and limit country risk. For a further discussion of our country risk exposure see “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Risk—Country and Other Risks” in the 2024 Form 10-K.
Top 10 Non-U.S. Country Exposures
1.
Net inventory represents exposure to both long and short single-name and index positions (
i.e
., bonds and equities at fair value and CDS based on a notional amount assuming zero recovery adjusted for the fair value of any receivable or payable).
2.
Net counterparty exposure (
e.g
., repurchase transactions, securities lending and OTC derivatives) is net of the benefit of collateral received and also is net by counterparty when legally enforceable master netting agreements are in place.
3.
Amounts represent net CDS hedges (purchased and sold) on net counterparty exposure and lending executed by trading desks responsible for hedging counterparty and lending credit risk exposures. Amounts are based on the CDS notional amount assuming zero recovery adjusted for the fair value of any receivable or payable. For further description of the contractual terms for purchased credit protection and whether they may limit the effectiveness of our hedges, see “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Risk—Credit Risk—Derivatives” in the 2024 Form 10-K.
Operational Risk
Operational risk refers to the risk of loss, or of damage to our reputation, resulting from inadequate or failed processes or systems, human factors (
e.g.
, inappropriate or unlawful conduct) or external events (e.g., cyberattacks or third-party vulnerabilities) that may manifest as, for example, loss of information, business disruption, theft and fraud, legal and compliance risks, or damage to physical assets. We may incur operational risk across the full scope of our business activities, including revenue-generating activities and support and control groups (
e.g.
, IT and trade processing). For a further discussion about our operational risk, see “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Risk—Operational Risk” in the 2024 Form 10-K.
Model Risk
Model risk is the potential for adverse consequences from decisions based on incorrect or misused model outputs. Model risk can lead to financial loss, poor business and strategic decision-making, noncompliance with applicable laws and/or regulations or damage to the Firm's reputation. The risk inherent in a model is a function of the materiality, complexity and uncertainty around inputs and assumptions. Model risk is generated from the use of models impacting financial statements, regulatory filings, capital adequacy assessments and the formulation of strategy. For a further discussion about our model risk, see “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Risk—Model Risk” in the 2024 Form 10-K.
Liquidity Risk
Liquidity risk refers to the risk that we will be unable to finance our operations due to a loss of access to the capital markets or difficulty in liquidating our assets. Liquidity risk also encompasses our ability (or perceived ability) to meet our financial obligations without experiencing significant business disruption or reputational damage that may threaten our viability as a going concern. For a further discussion about our liquidity risk, see “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Risk—Liquidity Risk” in the 2024 Form 10-K and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources” herein.
Legal, Regulatory and Compliance Risk
Legal, regulatory and compliance risk includes the risk of legal or regulatory sanctions, material financial loss, including fines, penalties, judgments, damages and/or settlements, limitations on our business, or loss to reputation that we may suffer as a result of failure to comply with laws, regulations, rules, related self-regulatory organization standards and codes of conduct applicable to our business activities. This risk also includes contractual and commercial risk, such as the risk that a counterparty’s performance obligations will be unenforceable. It also includes compliance with AML,
terrorist financing, and anti-corruption rules and regulations. For a further discussion about our legal and compliance risk, see “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Risk—Legal, Regulatory and Compliance Risk” in the 2024 Form 10-K.
Climate Risk
Climate change manifests as physical and transition risks. The physical risks of climate change include harm to people and property arising from acute climate-related events, such as floods, hurricanes, heatwaves, droughts and wildfires, and chronic, longer-term shifts in climate patterns, such as higher global average temperatures, rising sea levels and long-term droughts. The transition risks of climate change include policy, legal, technology and market changes. Examples of these transition risks include changes in consumer and business sentiment, related technologies, shareholder preferences and any additional regulatory and legislative requirements, including increased disclosure or regulation of carbon emissions. Climate risk, which is not expected to have a significant effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition in the near term, is an overarching risk that can impact other categories of risk. For a further discussion about our climate risk, see “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Risk—Climate Risk” in the 2024 Form 10-K.
Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Morgan Stanley:
Results of Review of Interim Financial Information
We have reviewed the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet of Morgan Stanley and subsidiaries (the “Firm”) as of March 31, 2025, and the related condensed consolidated income statements, comprehensive income statements, cash flow statements and statements of changes in total equity for the three-month periods ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “interim financial information”). Based on our reviews, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the accompanying interim financial information for it to be in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
We have previously audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheet of the Firm as of December 31, 2024, and the related consolidated income statement, comprehensive income statement, cash flow statement and statement of changes in total equity for the year then ended (not presented herein) included in the Firm’s Annual Report on Form 10-K; and in our report dated February 21, 2025, we expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. In our opinion, the information set forth in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2024, is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the consolidated balance sheet from which it has been derived.
Basis for Review Results
This interim financial information is the responsibility of the Firm’s management. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Firm in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our reviews in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. A review of interim financial information consists principally of applying analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB, the objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.

Institutional clients include defined benefit/defined contribution plans, foundations,
endowments, government entities, sovereign wealth funds, insurance companies, third-party fund sponsors and corporations. Individual clients are generally served through intermediaries, including affiliated and non-affiliated distributors.
Basis of Financial Information
The financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which requires the Firm to make estimates and assumptions regarding the valuations of certain financial instruments, the valuations of goodwill and intangible assets, the outcome of legal and tax matters, deferred tax assets, ACL, and other matters that affect its financial statements and related disclosures. The Firm believes that the estimates utilized in the preparation of its financial statements are prudent and reasonable. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates.
The Notes are an integral part of the Firm’s financial statements. The Firm has evaluated subsequent events for adjustment to or disclosure in these financial statements through the date of this report and has not identified any recordable or disclosable events not otherwise reported in these financial statements or the notes thereto.
The accompanying financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Firm’s financial statements and notes thereto included in the 2024 Form 10-K. Certain footnote disclosures included in the 2024 Form 10-K have been condensed or omitted from these financial statements as they are not required for interim reporting under U.S. GAAP. The financial statements reflect all adjustments of a normal, recurring nature that are, in the opinion of management, necessary for the fair presentation of the results for the interim period. The results of operations for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results for the entire year.
Consolidation
The financial statements include the accounts of the Firm, its wholly owned subsidiaries and other entities in which the Firm has a controlling financial interest, including certain VIEs (see Note 14). Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. For consolidated subsidiaries that are not wholly owned, the third-party holdings of equity interests are referred to as Noncontrolling interests. The net income attributable to Noncontrolling interests for such subsidiaries is presented as Net income applicable to noncontrolling interests in the income statement. The portion of shareholders’ equity that is attributable to Noncontrolling interests for such subsidiaries is presented as Noncontrolling interests, a component of Total equity, in the balance sheet.
For a discussion of the Firm’s significant regulated U.S. and international subsidiaries and its involvement with VIEs, see Note 1 to the financial statements in the 2024 Form 10-K.

Fair Values
Recurring Fair Value Measurements
Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis
MABS—Mortgage- and asset-backed securities
1.
For positions with the same counterparty that cross over the levels of the fair value hierarchy, both counterparty netting and cash collateral netting are included in the column titled “Netting.” Positions classified within the same level that are with the same counterparty are netted within that level. For further information on derivative instruments and hedging activities, see Note 6.
2.
For a further breakdown by type, see the following Detail of Loans and Lending Commitments at Fair Value table.
3.
For trading purposes, the Firm holds or sells short equity securities issued by entities in diverse industries and of varying sizes.
4.
Amounts exclude certain investments that are measured based on NAV per share, which are not classified in the fair value hierarchy. For additional disclosure about such investments, see “Net Asset Value Measurements” herein.
5.
At March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, the Firm’s Trading assets included an insignificant amount of equity securities subject to contractual sale restrictions that generally prohibit the Firm from selling the security for a period of time as of the measurement date.
Detail of Loans and Lending Commitments at Fair Value
Unsettled Fair Value of Futures Contracts
1
1.
These contracts are primarily Level 1, actively traded, valued based on quoted prices from the exchange and are excluded from the previous recurring fair value tables.
For a description of the valuation techniques applied to the Firm’s major categories of assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis, see Note 4 to the financial statements in the 2024 Form 10-K. During the current quarter, there were no significant revisions made to the Firm’s valuation techniques.
Rollforward of Level 3 Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis
Level 3 instruments may be hedged with instruments classified in Level 1 and Level 2. The realized and unrealized gains or losses for assets and liabilities within the Level 3 category presented in the previous tables do not reflect the related realized and unrealized gains or losses on hedging instruments that have been classified by the Firm within the Level 1 and/or Level 2 categories.
The unrealized gains (losses) during the period for assets and liabilities within the Level 3 category may include changes in fair value during the period that were attributable to both observable and unobservable inputs. Total realized and unrealized gains (losses) are primarily included in Trading revenues in the income statement.
Additionally, in the previous tables, consolidations of VIEs are included in Purchases, and deconsolidations of VIEs are included in Settlements.
Significant Unobservable Inputs Used in Recurring and Nonrecurring Level 3 Fair Value Measurements
Valuation Techniques and Unobservable Inputs
Points—Percentage of par
IR—Interest rate
FX—Foreign exchange
1.
A single amount is disclosed for range and average when there is no significant difference between the minimum, maximum and average. Amounts represent weighted averages except where simple averages and the median of the inputs are more relevant.
2.
Includes derivative contracts with multiple risks (
i.e.
, hybrid products).
The previous table provides information on the valuation techniques, significant unobservable inputs, and the ranges and averages for each major category of assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring and nonrecurring basis with a significant Level 3 balance. The level of aggregation and breadth of products cause the range of inputs to be wide
and not evenly distributed across the inventory of financial instruments. Further, the range of unobservable inputs may differ across firms in the financial services industry because of diversity in the types of products included in each firm’s inventory. Generally, there are no predictable relationships between multiple significant unobservable inputs attributable to a given valuation technique.
For a description of the Firm’s significant unobservable inputs and qualitative information about the effect of hypothetical changes in the values of those inputs, see Note 4 to the financial statements in the 2024 Form 10-K. During the three months ended March 31, 2025, there were no significant revisions made to the descriptions of the Firm’s significant unobservable inputs.
Net Asset Value Measurements
Fund Interests
Amounts in the previous table represent the Firm’s carrying value of general and limited partnership interests in fund investments, as well as any related performance-based income in the form of carried interest. The carrying amounts are measured based on the NAV of the fund taking into account the distribution terms applicable to the interest held. This same measurement applies whether the fund investments are accounted for under the equity method or fair value.
For a description of the Firm’s investments in private equity and other funds, real estate funds and hedge funds, which are measured based on NAV, see Note 4 to the financial statements in the 2024 Form 10-K.
See Note 13 for information regarding general partner guarantees, which include potential obligations to return performance fee distributions previously received. See Note 19 for information regarding unrealized carried interest at risk of reversal.
Nonredeemable Funds by Contractual Maturity
Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements
Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis

For significant Level 3 balances, refer to “Significant Unobservable Inputs Used in Recurring and Nonrecurring Level 3 Fair Value Measurements” section herein for details of the significant unobservable inputs used for nonrecurring fair value measurement.
Gains (Losses) from Nonrecurring Fair Value Remeasurements
1
1.
Gains and losses for Loans and Other assets—Other investments are classified in Other revenues. For other items, gains and losses are recorded in Other revenues if the item is held for sale; otherwise, they are recorded in Other expenses.
2.
Nonrecurring changes in the fair value of loans and lending commitments, which exclude the impact of related economic hedges, are calculated as follows: for the held-for-investment category, based on the value of the underlying collateral; and for the held-for-sale category, based on recently executed transactions, market price quotations, valuation models that incorporate market observable inputs where possible, such as comparable loan or debt prices and CDS spread levels adjusted for any basis difference between cash and derivative instruments, or default recovery analysis where such transactions and quotations are unobservable.
3.
Losses related to Other assets—Other investments were determined using techniques that included discounted cash flow models, methodologies that incorporate multiples of certain comparable companies and recently executed transactions.
4.
Losses related to Other assets—Premises, equipment and software generally include impairments as well as write-offs related to the disposal of certain assets.
Financial Instruments Not Measured at Fair Value
1.
Amounts include loans measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis.
2.
Represents Lending commitments accounted for as Held for Investment and Held for Sale. For a further discussion on lending commitments, see Note 13.
The previous tables exclude all non-financial assets and liabilities, such as Goodwill and Intangible assets, and certain financial instruments, such as equity method investments and certain receivables.
5.
Fair Value Option
The Firm has elected the fair value option for certain eligible instruments that are risk managed on a fair value basis to mitigate income statement volatility caused by measurement basis differences between the elected instruments and their associated risk management transactions or to eliminate complexities of applying certain accounting models.
Borrowings Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis
Net Revenues from Liabilities under the Fair Value Option
1.
Amounts do not reflect any gains or losses from related economic hedges.
Gains (losses) from changes in fair value are recorded in Trading revenues and are mainly attributable to movements in the reference price or index, interest rates or foreign exchange rates.
Gains (Losses) Due to Changes in Instrument-Specific Credit Risk
1.
Loans and other receivables-specific credit gains (losses) were determined by excluding the non-credit components of gains and losses.
Difference Between Contractual Principal and Fair Value
1
1.
Amounts indicate contractual principal greater than or (less than) fair value.
2.
The majority of the difference between principal and fair value amounts for loans and other receivables relates to distressed debt positions purchased at amounts well below par.
3.
Excludes borrowings where the repayment of the initial principal amount fluctuates based on changes in a reference price or index.
The previous tables exclude non-recourse debt from consolidated VIEs, liabilities related to transfers of financial assets treated as collateralized financings, pledged commodities and other liabilities that have specified assets attributable to them.
Fair Value Loans on Nonaccrual Status
6.
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities
Fair Values of Derivative Contracts
1.
Amounts relate to master netting agreements and collateral agreements that have been determined by the Firm to be legally enforceable in the event of default but where certain other netting criteria are not met in accordance with applicable offsetting accounting guidance.
See Note 4 for information related to the unsettled fair value of futures contracts not designated as accounting hedges, which are excluded from the previous tables.
Notionals of Derivative Contracts
The notional amounts of derivative contracts generally overstate the Firm’s exposure. In most circumstances, notional amounts are used only as a reference point from which to calculate amounts owed between the parties to the contract. Furthermore, notional amounts do not reflect the benefit of legally enforceable netting arrangements or risk mitigating transactions.
For a discussion of the Firm’s derivative instruments and hedging activities, see Note 6 to the financial statements in the 2024 Form 10-K.
Gains (Losses) on Accounting Hedges

During the three months ended March 31, 2025, there were no forecasted transactions that failed to occur. The net gains (losses) associated with cash flow hedges expected to be reclassified from AOCI within 12 months as of March 31, 2025, is approximately $(
21
) million. The maximum length of time over which forecasted cash flows are hedged is
32
months.
Fair Value Hedges—Hedged Items

Net Derivative Liabilities and Collateral Posted
The previous table presents the aggregate fair value of certain derivative contracts that contain credit risk-related contingent features that are in a net liability position for which the Firm has posted collateral in the normal course of business.
Incremental Collateral and Termination Payments upon Potential Future Ratings Downgrade
1.
Amount represents arrangements between the Firm and other parties where upon the downgrade of one party, the downgraded party must deliver collateral to the other party. These bilateral downgrade arrangements are used by the Firm to manage the risk of counterparty downgrades.
The additional collateral or termination payments that may be called in the event of a future credit rating downgrade vary by contract and can be based on ratings by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., S&P Global Ratings and/or other rating
agencies. The previous table shows the future potential collateral amounts and termination payments that could be called or required by counterparties or exchange and clearing organizations in the event of one-notch or two-notch downgrade scenarios based on the relevant contractual downgrade triggers.

1.
Investment grade/non-investment grade determination is based on the internal credit rating of the reference obligation. Internal credit ratings serve as the CRM’s assessment of credit risk and the basis for a comprehensive credit limits framework used to control credit risk. The Firm uses quantitative models and judgment to estimate the various risk parameters related to each obligor.
Protection Purchased with CDS
The Firm enters into credit derivatives, principally CDS, under which it receives or provides protection against the risk of default on a set of debt obligations issued by a specified reference entity or entities. A majority of the Firm’s counterparties for these derivatives are banks, broker-dealers, and insurance and other financial institutions.
The fair value amounts as shown in the previous tables are prior to cash collateral or counterparty netting. For further information on credit derivatives and other credit contracts, see Note 6 to the financial statements in the 2024 Form 10-K.

AFS Securities in an Unrealized Loss Position
For AFS securities, the Firm believes there are no securities in an unrealized loss position that have credit losses after performing the analysis described in Note 2 in the 2024 Form 10-K and the Firm expects to recover the amortized cost basis of these securities. Additionally, the Firm does not intend to sell these securities and is not likely to be required to sell these securities prior to recovery of the amortized cost basis. As of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, the securities in an unrealized loss position are predominantly investment grade.
The HTM securities net carrying amounts at March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024 reflect an ACL of  $
59
million and $
52
million, respectively, predominantly related to Non-agency CMBS. See Note 2 in the 2024 Form 10-K for a description of the ACL methodology used for HTM Securities.
As of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024,
98
% of the Firm’s portfolio of HTM securities were investment grade U.S. agency securities, U.S. Treasury securities and Agency CMBS, which were on accrual status and for which there is an underlying assumption of
zero
credit losses. Non-investment grade HTM securities primarily consisted of certain Non-agency CMBS securities, for which the expected credit losses were insignificant and were predominantly on accrual status at March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024.
See Note 14 for additional information on securities issued by VIEs, including U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities, non-agency CMBS, and FFELP student loan ABS.

loans held for investment that  defaulted during the three months ended March 31, 2024 that had been modified in the 12 month period prior.
Allowance for Credit Losses Rollforward and Allocation—Loans and Lending Commitments
CRE—Commercial real estate
SBL—Securities-based lending
1.
Percent of loans to total loans represents loans held for investment by loan type to total loans held for investment.
The allowance for credit losses for loans and lending commitments increased during the three months ended March 31, 2025, primarily related to portfolio growth in secured lending facilities and corporate loans, provisions for certain specific loans, including residential real estate loans related to the California wildfires, and deterioration in the macroeconomic outlook. Charge-offs in the current quarter were primarily related to commercial real estate loans.
The base scenario used in our ACL models as of March 31, 2025 was generated using a combination of consensus economic forecasts, forward rates, and internally developed and validated models. This scenario assumes slower economic growth as well as higher interest rates relative to the prior quarter forecast. The revised real GDP growth rates assumed in our ACL models incorporated the weaker economic outlook and conditions as of March 31, 2025. The ACL calculation incorporates key macroeconomic variables, including U.S. real GDP growth rate. The significance of key macroeconomic variables on the ACL calculation varies depending on portfolio composition and economic conditions. Other key macroeconomic variables used in the ACL calculation include corporate credit spreads, interest rates and commercial real estate indices.
For a further discussion of the Firm’s loans as well as the Firm’s allowance methodology, refer to Notes 2 and 9 to the financial statements in the 2024 Form 10-K.

56
million.
4.
Related to commercial, residential mortgage and asset backed securitizations.
The Firm has obligations under certain guarantee arrangements, including contracts and indemnification agreements, that contingently require the Firm to make
payments to the guaranteed party based on changes in an underlying measure (such as an interest or foreign exchange rate, security or commodity price, an index, or the occurrence or non-occurrence of a specified event) related to an asset, liability or equity security of a guaranteed party. Also included as guarantees are contracts that contingently require the Firm to make payments to the guaranteed party based on another entity’s failure to perform under an agreement, as well as indirect guarantees of the indebtedness of others.
For more information on the nature of the obligations and related business activities for our guarantees, see Note 14 to the financial statements in the 2024 Form 10-K.
Other Guarantees and Indemnities
In the normal course of business, the Firm provides guarantees and indemnifications in a variety of transactions. These provisions generally are standard contractual terms. Certain of these guarantees and indemnifications related to indemnities, market value guarantees, exchange and clearinghouse member guarantees, futures and over-the-counter derivatives clearing guarantees and merger and acquisition guarantees are described in Note 14 to the financial statements in the 2024 Form 10-K.
In addition, in the ordinary course of business, the Firm guarantees the debt and/or certain trading obligations (including obligations associated with derivatives, foreign exchange contracts and the settlement of physical commodities) of certain subsidiaries. These guarantees generally are entity or product specific and are required by investors or trading counterparties. The activities of the Firm’s subsidiaries covered by these guarantees (including any related debt or trading obligations) are included in the financial statements.
Finance Subsidiary
The Parent Company fully and unconditionally guarantees the securities issued by Morgan Stanley Finance LLC, a wholly owned finance subsidiary. No other subsidiary of the Parent Company guarantees these securities.
Contingencies
Legal
In addition to the matters described below, in the normal course of business, the Firm has been named, from time to time, as a defendant in various legal actions, including arbitrations, class actions and other litigation, arising in connection with its activities as a global diversified financial services institution. Certain of the actual or threatened legal actions include claims for substantial compensatory and/or punitive damages or claims for indeterminate amounts of damages. In some cases, the third-party entities that are, or would otherwise be, the primary defendants in such cases are bankrupt, in financial distress, or may not honor applicable
indemnification obligations. These actions have included, but are not limited to, antitrust claims, claims under various false claims act statutes, and matters arising from our wealth management businesses, sales and trading businesses, and our activities in the capital markets.
The Firm is also involved, from time to time, in other reviews, investigations and proceedings (both formal and informal) by governmental or other regulatory agencies regarding the Firm’s business, and involving, among other matters, sales, trading, financing, prime brokerage, market-making activities, investment banking advisory services, capital markets activities, financial products or offerings sponsored, underwritten or sold by the Firm, wealth and investment management services, and accounting and operational matters, certain of which may result in adverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, disgorgement, restitution, forfeiture, injunctions, limitations on our ability to conduct certain business, or other relief.
The Firm contests liability and/or the amount of damages as appropriate in each pending matter. Where available information indicates that it is probable a liability had been incurred at the date of the financial statements and the Firm can reasonably estimate the amount of that loss or the range of loss, the Firm accrues an estimated loss by a charge to income, including with respect to certain of the individual proceedings or investigations described below.
The Firm’s legal expenses can, and may in the future, fluctuate from period to period, given the current environment regarding government or regulatory agency investigations and private litigation affecting global financial services firms, including the Firm.
In many legal proceedings and investigations, it is inherently difficult to determine whether any loss is probable or reasonably possible, or to estimate the amount of any loss. In addition, even where the Firm has determined that a loss is probable or reasonably possible or an exposure to loss or range of loss exists in excess of the liability already accrued with respect to a previously recognized loss contingency, the Firm may be unable to reasonably estimate the amount of the loss or range of loss. It is particularly difficult to determine if a loss is probable or reasonably possible, or to estimate the amount of loss, where the factual record is being developed or contested or where plaintiffs or government entities seek substantial or indeterminate damages, restitution, forfeiture, disgorgement or penalties. Numerous issues may need to be resolved in an investigation or proceeding before a determination can be made that a loss or additional loss (or range of loss or range of additional loss) is probable or reasonably possible, or to estimate the amount of loss, including through potentially lengthy discovery or determination of important factual matters, determination of issues related to class certification, the calculation of damages or other relief, and consideration of novel or unsettled legal
questions relevant to the proceedings or investigations in question.
The Firm has identified below any individual proceedings or investigations where the Firm believes a material loss to be reasonably possible. In certain legal proceedings in which the Firm has determined that a material loss is reasonably possible, the Firm is unable to reasonably estimate the loss or range of loss. There are other matters in which the Firm has determined a loss or range of loss to be reasonably possible, but the Firm does not believe, based on current knowledge and after consultation with counsel, that such losses could have a material adverse effect on the Firm’s financial statements as a whole, although the outcome of such proceedings or investigations may significantly impact the Firm’s business or results of operations for any particular reporting period, or cause significant reputational harm.
While the Firm has identified below certain proceedings or investigations that the Firm believes to be material, individually or collectively, there can be no assurance that material losses will not be incurred from claims that have not yet been asserted or those where potential losses have not yet been determined to be probable or reasonably possible.
Antitrust Related Matters
The Firm and other financial institutions are responding to a number of governmental investigations and civil litigation matters related to allegations of anticompetitive conduct in various aspects of the financial services industry, including the matters described below.
Beginning in February of 2016, the Firm was named as a defendant in multiple purported antitrust class actions now consolidated into a single proceeding in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (“SDNY”) styled
In Re: Interest Rate Swaps Antitrust Litigation
. Plaintiffs allege, inter alia, that the Firm, together with a number of other financial institution defendants, violated U.S. and New York state antitrust laws from 2008 through December of 2016 in connection with alleged efforts to prevent the development of electronic exchange-based platforms for interest rate swaps trading. Complaints were filed both on behalf of a purported class of investors who purchased interest rate swaps from defendants, as well as on behalf of
three
operators of swap execution facilities that allegedly were thwarted by the defendants in their efforts to develop such platforms. The consolidated complaints seek, inter alia, certification of the investor class of plaintiffs and treble damages. On July 28, 2017, the court granted in part and denied in part the defendants’ motion to dismiss the complaints. On December 15, 2023, the court denied the class plaintiffs’ motion for class certification. On December 29, 2023, the class plaintiffs petitioned the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit for leave to appeal that decision. On February 28, 2024, the parties reached an agreement in principle to settle the class claims. On July 11,
2024, the court granted preliminary approval of the settlement.
The Firm is a defendant in
three
antitrust class action complaints which have been consolidated into one proceeding in the United States District Court for the SDNY under the caption
City of Philadelphia, et al. v. Bank of America Corporation, et al.
Plaintiffs allege, inter alia, that the Firm, together with a number of other financial institution defendants, violated U.S. antitrust laws and relevant state laws in connection with alleged efforts to artificially inflate interest rates for Variable Rate Demand Obligations (“VRDO”). The consolidated complaint seeks, inter alia, certification of the class of plaintiffs and treble damages. The complaint was filed on behalf of a class of municipal issuers of VRDO for which defendants served as remarketing agent. On November 2, 2020, the court granted in part and denied in part the defendants’ motion to dismiss the consolidated complaint, dismissing state law claims, but denying dismissal of the U.S. antitrust claims. On September 21, 2023, the court granted plaintiffs’ motion for class certification. On February 5, 2024, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit granted leave to appeal that decision.
European Matters
Tax
In matters styled
Case number 15/3637
and
Case number 15/4353
, the Dutch Tax Authority (“Dutch Authority”) challenged in the Dutch courts the prior set-off by the Firm of approximately €
124
million (approximately $
134
million) plus accrued interest of withholding tax credits against the Firm’s corporation tax liabilities for the tax years 2007 to 2012. The Dutch Authority alleged that the Firm was not entitled to receive the withholding tax credits on the basis, inter alia, that a Firm subsidiary did not hold legal title to certain securities subject to withholding tax on the relevant dates. On April 26, 2018, the District Court in Amsterdam issued a decision dismissing the Dutch Authority’s claims with respect to certain of the tax years in dispute. On May 12, 2020, the Court of Appeal in Amsterdam granted the Dutch Authority’s appeal in matters re-styled
Case number 18/00318
and
Case number 18/00319
. On January 19, 2024, the Dutch High Court granted the Firm’s appeal in matters re-styled
Case number 20/01884
and referred the case to the Court of Appeal in The Hague. On November 11, 2024, the Firm reached an agreement to settle the Dutch Authority’s challenges for the tax years 2007 to 2012 and made payment of the prior set-off amounts and interest indicated above. The case has been withdrawn.
On June 22, 2021, Dutch criminal authorities sought various documents in connection with an investigation of the Firm related to the civil claims asserted by the Dutch Authority concerning the accuracy of the Firm subsidiary’s tax returns for 2007 to 2012. The Dutch criminal authorities have requested additional information, and the Firm is continuing
to respond to them in connection with their ongoing investigation, and is engaging with them as the criminal process progresses.
U.K. Government Bond Matter
On February 21, 2025, the U.K. Competition and Markets Authority announced a settlement with the Firm, as well as other financial institutions, in connection with its investigation of suspected anti-competitive arrangements in the financial services sector, specifically regarding the Firm’s activities concerning certain liquid fixed income products between 2009 and 2012. Separately, on June 16, 2023, the Firm was named as a defendant in a purported antitrust class action in the United States District Court for the SDNY styled
Oklahoma Firefighters Pension and Retirement System v. Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft, et al.
, alleging, inter alia, that the Firm, together with a number of other financial institution defendants, violated U.S. antitrust laws in connection with their alleged effort to fix prices of gilts traded in the United States between 2009 and 2013. The complaint seeks, inter alia, certification of the class of plaintiffs and treble damages. On September 16, 2024, the court granted defendants’ joint motion to dismiss, and the complaint was dismissed without prejudice. In October of 2024, the Firm and certain other defendants reached an agreement in principle to settle the U.S. litigation. On March 17, 2025, the court granted preliminary approval of the settlement.
Other
On August 13, 2021, the plaintiff in
Camelot Event Driven Fund, a Series of Frank Funds Trust v. Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, et al.
filed in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, New York County (“Supreme Court of NY”) a purported class action complaint alleging violations of federal securities laws against ViacomCBS (“Viacom”), certain of its officers and directors, and the underwriters, including the Firm, of two March 2021 Viacom offerings: a $
1.7
billion Viacom Class B Common Stock offering and a $
1
billion offering of
5.75
% Series A Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock (collectively, the “Offerings”). The complaint seeks certification of the class of plaintiffs and unspecified compensatory damages and alleges, inter alia, that the Viacom offering documents for both issuances contained material misrepresentations and omissions because they did not disclose that certain of the underwriters, including the Firm, had prime brokerage relationships and/or served as counterparties to certain derivative transactions with Archegos Capital Management LP (“Archegos”), a fund with significant exposure to Viacom securities across multiple prime brokers. The complaint also alleges that the offering documents did not adequately disclose the risks associated with Archegos’s concentrated Viacom positions at the various prime brokers, including that the unwind of those positions could have a deleterious impact on the stock price of Viacom. On November 5, 2021, the complaint was amended to add allegations that defendants failed to disclose that certain
underwriters, including the Firm, had intended to unwind Archegos’s Viacom positions while simultaneously distributing the Offerings. On February 6, 2023, the court issued a decision denying motions to dismiss as to the Firm and the other underwriters, but granting the motion to dismiss as to Viacom and the Viacom individual defendants. On February 15, 2023, the underwriters, including the Firm, filed their notices of appeal of the denial of their motions to dismiss. On March 10, 2023, the plaintiff appealed the dismissal of Viacom and the individual Viacom defendants. On April 4, 2024, the Appellate Division upheld the lower court’s decision as to the Firm and other underwriter defendants that had prime brokerage relationships and/or served as counterparties to certain derivative transactions with Archegos, dismissed the remaining underwriters, and upheld the dismissal of Viacom and its officers and directors. On July 25, 2024, the Appellate Division denied the plaintiff’s and the Firm’s respective motions for leave to reargue or appeal the April 4, 2024 decision. On January 4, 2024, the court granted the plaintiff’s motion for class certification, which the defendants appealed. In February of 2025, the parties reached an agreement in principle to settle the litigation. On April 3, 2025, the court granted preliminary approval of the settlement.
On May 17, 2013, the plaintiff in
IKB International S.A. in Liquidation, et al. v. Morgan Stanley, et al.
filed a complaint against the Firm and certain affiliates in the Supreme Court of NY. The complaint alleges that defendants made material misrepresentations and omissions in the sale to the plaintiff of certain mortgage pass-through certificates backed by securitization trusts containing residential mortgage loans. The total amount of certificates allegedly sponsored, underwritten and/or sold by the Firm to the plaintiff was approximately $
133
million. The complaint alleges causes of action against the Firm for common law fraud, fraudulent concealment, aiding and abetting fraud, and negligent misrepresentation, and seeks, inter alia, compensatory and punitive damages. On October 29, 2014, the court granted in part and denied in part the Firm’s motion to dismiss. All claims regarding
four
certificates were dismissed. After these dismissals, the remaining amount of certificates allegedly issued by the Firm or sold to the plaintiff by the Firm was approximately $
116
million. On August 11, 2016, the Appellate Division affirmed the trial court’s order denying in part the Firm’s motion to dismiss the complaint. On July 15, 2022, the Firm filed a motion for summary judgment on all remaining claims. On March 1, 2023, the court granted in part and denied in part the Firm’s motion for summary judgment, narrowing the alleged misrepresentations at issue in the case. On March 26, 2024, the Appellate Division affirmed the trial court’s summary judgment order. On August 27, 2024, the plaintiff notified the court that in light of the court’s rulings to exclude certain evidence at trial, the plaintiff could not prove its claims at trial, and requested that the court dismiss the case, subject to its right to appeal the evidentiary rulings. On August 28, 2024, the court dismissed the case, and judgment was entered in the Firm’s favor. The plaintiff has appealed.
Beginning in February of 2024, Morgan Stanley Smith Barney LLC (“MSSB”) and E*TRADE Securities LLC (“E*TRADE Securities”), among others, have been named as defendants in multiple putative class actions pending in the federal district courts for the District of New Jersey and SDNY. The class action claims have been brought on behalf of brokerage, advisory and retirement account holders, alleging various contractual, fiduciary, and statutory claims (including under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, 18 U.S.C. §1962(c)-(d)) that MSSB and/or E*TRADE Securities failed to pay a reasonable rate of interest on its cash sweep products. The cases are at an early stage with motions for consolidation and transfer currently pending. Together, the complaints seek, inter alia, certification of a class of plaintiffs, unspecified compensatory damages, equitable and injunctive relief, and treble damages.
The Firm was engaged with and responded to requests for information from the Enforcement Division of the SEC regarding advisory account cash balances swept to the affiliate bank deposit program and compliance with the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, and is responding to requests from a state securities regulator regarding brokerage account cash balances swept to the affiliate bank deposit program. On March 11, 2025, the Enforcement Division of the SEC informed the Firm that it had concluded its investigation and did not intend to recommend an enforcement action against the Firm.

Variable Interest Entities and Securitization Activities
Consolidated VIE Assets and Liabilities by Type of Activity
MTOB—Municipal tender option bonds
1.
Amounts include transactions backed by residential mortgage loans, commercial mortgage loans and other types of assets, including consumer or commercial assets and may be in loan or security form. The value of assets is determined based on the fair value of the liabilities and the interests owned by the Firm in such VIEs as the fair values for the liabilities and interests owned are more observable.
2.
Amounts include investment funds and CLOs.
Consolidated VIE Assets and Liabilities by Balance Sheet Caption
Consolidated VIE assets and liabilities are presented in the previous tables after intercompany eliminations. Generally, most assets owned by consolidated VIEs cannot be removed unilaterally by the Firm and are not available to the Firm while the related liabilities issued by consolidated VIEs are non-recourse to the Firm. However, in certain consolidated VIEs, the Firm either has the unilateral right to remove assets or provides additional recourse through derivatives such as total return swaps, guarantees or other forms of involvement.
In general, the Firm’s exposure to loss in consolidated VIEs is limited to losses that would be absorbed on the VIE net assets recognized in its financial statements, net of amounts absorbed by third-party variable interest holders.
Non-consolidated VIEs
OSF–Other structured financings
1.
Amounts include transactions backed by residential mortgage loans, commercial mortgage loans and other types of assets, including consumer or commercial assets, and may be in loan or security form.
2.
Other primarily includes exposures to commercial real estate property and investment funds.
3.
Where notional amounts are utilized in quantifying the maximum exposure related to derivatives, such amounts do not reflect changes in fair value recorded by the Firm.
4.
Additional VIE assets owned represents the carrying value of total exposure to non-consolidated VIEs for which the maximum exposure to loss is less than specific thresholds, primarily interests issued by securitization SPEs. The Firm’s maximum exposure to loss generally equals the fair value of the assets owned. These assets are primarily included in Trading assets and Investment securities and are measured at fair value (see Note 4). The Firm does not provide additional support in these transactions through contractual facilities, guarantees or similar derivatives.
The previous tables include VIEs sponsored by unrelated parties, as well as VIEs sponsored by the Firm; examples of the Firm’s involvement with these VIEs include its secondary market-making activities and the securities held in its Investment securities portfolio (see Note 7).
The Firm’s maximum exposure to loss is dependent on the nature of the Firm’s variable interest in the VIE and is limited to the notional amounts of certain liquidity facilities and other credit support, total return swaps and written put options, as well as the fair value of certain other derivatives and investments the Firm has made in the VIE.
The Firm’s maximum exposure to loss in the previous tables does not include the offsetting benefit of hedges or any reductions associated with the amount of collateral held as part of a transaction with the VIE or any party to the VIE directly against a specific exposure to loss.
Liabilities issued by VIEs generally are non-recourse to the Firm.
Detail of Mortgage- and Asset-Backed Securitization Assets
Transferred Assets with Continuing Involvement
RML—Residential mortgage loans
CML—Commercial mortgage loans
1.
Amounts include CLO transactions managed by unrelated third parties.
2.
Amounts include assets transferred by unrelated transferors.
3.
Amounts include transactions where the Firm also holds retained interests as part of the transfer.
The previous tables include transactions with SPEs in which the Firm, acting as principal, transferred financial assets with continuing involvement and received sales treatment. The transferred assets are carried at fair value prior to securitization, and any changes in fair value are recognized in the income statement. The Firm may act as underwriter of the beneficial interests issued by these securitization vehicles, for which Investment banking revenues are recognized. The Firm may retain interests in the securitized financial assets as one or more tranches of the securitization. Certain retained interests are carried at fair value in the balance sheet with changes in fair value recognized in the income statement. Fair value for these interests is measured using techniques that are consistent with the valuation techniques applied to the Firm’s major categories of assets and liabilities as described in Note 2 in the 2024 Form 10-K and Note 4 herein. Further, as permitted by applicable guidance, certain transfers of assets where the Firm’s only continuing involvement is a derivative are only reported in the following Assets Sold with Retained Exposure table.
Proceeds from New Securitization Transactions and Sales of Loans
1.
Net gains on new transactions and sales of corporate loans to CLO entities at the time of the sale were not material for all periods presented.
The Firm has provided, or otherwise agreed to be responsible for, representations and warranties regarding certain assets transferred in securitization transactions sponsored by the Firm (see Note 13).
Assets Sold with Retained Exposure
1.
The carrying value of assets derecognized at the time of sale approximates gross cash proceeds.
The Firm enters into transactions in which it sells securities, primarily equities, and contemporaneously enters into bilateral OTC derivatives with the purchasers of the securities, through which it retains exposure to the sold securities.
For a discussion of the Firm’s VIEs, the determination and structure of VIEs and securitization activities, see Note 15 to the financial statements in the 2024 Form 10-K.

Regulatory Requirements
Regulatory Capital Framework and Requirements
For a discussion of the Firm’s regulatory capital framework, see Note 16 to the financial statements in the 2024 Form 10-K.
The Firm is required to maintain minimum risk-based and leverage-based capital ratios under regulatory capital requirements. A summary of the calculations of regulatory capital and RWA follows.
Risk-Based Regulatory Capital.
Risk-based capital ratio requirements apply to Common Equity Tier 1 (“CET1”) capital, Tier 1 capital and Total capital (which includes Tier 2 capital), each as a percentage of RWA, and consist of regulatory minimum required ratios plus the Firm’s capital buffer requirement. Capital requirements require certain adjustments to, and deductions from, capital for purposes of determining these ratios. At March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, the differences between the actual and required ratios were lower under the Standardized Approach.
CECL Deferral.
Beginning on January 1, 2020, the Firm elected to defer the effect of the adoption of CECL on its risk-based and leverage-based capital amounts and ratios, as well as RWA, adjusted average assets and supplementary leverage exposure calculations, over a five-year transition period. The deferral impacts began to phase in at 25% per year from January 1, 2022, were phased-in at 75% from January 1, 2024 and were fully phased-in from January 1, 2025.
Capital Buffer Requirements
1.
The CCyB can be set up to
2.5
%, but is currently set by the Federal Reserve at
zero
.
The capital buffer requirement represents the amount of CET1 capital the Firm must maintain above the minimum risk-based capital requirements in order to avoid restrictions on the Firm’s ability to make capital distributions, including the payment of dividends and the repurchase of stock, and to pay discretionary bonuses to executive officers. The Firm’s capital buffer requirement computed under the standardized approaches for calculating credit risk and market risk RWA (“Standardized Approach”) is equal to the sum of the SCB, G-SIB capital surcharge and CCyB, and the capital buffer requirement computed under the applicable advanced approaches for calculating credit risk, market risk and operational risk RWA (“Advanced Approach”) is equal to the sum of the
2.5
% capital conservation buffer, G-SIB capital surcharge and CCyB.
Risk-Based Regulatory Capital Ratio Requirements
1.
Required ratios represent the regulatory minimum plus the capital buffer requirement.
The Firm’s Regulatory Capital and Capital Ratios
Risk-based capital
1.
Required ratios are inclusive of any buffers applicable as of the date presented.
Leveraged-based capital
1.
Adjusted average assets represents the denominator of the Tier 1 leverage ratio and is composed of the average daily balance of consolidated on-balance sheet assets for the quarters ending on the respective balance sheet dates, reduced by disallowed goodwill, intangible assets, investments in covered funds, defined benefit pension plan assets, after-tax gain on sale from assets sold into securitizations, investments in our own capital instruments, certain deferred tax assets and other capital deductions.
2.
Supplementary leverage exposure is the sum of Adjusted average assets used in the Tier 1 leverage ratio and other adjustments, primarily: (i) for derivatives, potential future exposure and the effective notional principal amount of sold credit protection offset by qualifying purchased credit protection; (ii) the counterparty credit risk for repo-style transactions; and (iii) the credit equivalent amount for off-balance sheet exposures.
3.
Required ratios are inclusive of any buffers applicable as of the date presented.
U.S. Bank Subsidiaries’ Regulatory Capital and Capital Ratios
The OCC establishes capital requirements for the U.S. Bank Subsidiaries, and evaluates their compliance with such capital requirements. Regulatory capital requirements for the U.S. Bank Subsidiaries are calculated in a similar manner to the Firm’s regulatory capital requirements, although G-SIB capital surcharge and SCB requirements do not apply to the U.S. Bank Subsidiaries.
The OCC’s regulatory capital framework includes Prompt Corrective Action (“PCA”) standards, including “well-capitalized” PCA standards that are based on specified regulatory capital ratio minimums. For the Firm to remain an FHC, its U.S. Bank Subsidiaries must remain well-capitalized in accordance with the OCC’s PCA standards. In addition,
failure by the U.S. Bank Subsidiaries to meet minimum capital requirements may result in certain mandatory and discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the U.S. Bank Subsidiaries’ and the Firm’s financial statements.
At March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, MSBNA and MSPBNA risk-based capital ratios are based on the Standardized Approach rules. Beginning on January 1, 2020, MSBNA and MSPBNA elected to defer the effect of the adoption of CECL on risk-based capital amounts and ratios, as well as RWA, adjusted average assets and supplementary leverage exposure calculations, over a five-year transition period. The deferral impacts began to phase in at 25% per year from January 1, 2022, were phased-in at 75% from January 1, 2024 and were fully phased-in from January 1, 2025.
MSBNA’s Regulatory Capital
MSPBNA’s Regulatory Capital
1.
Required ratios are inclusive of any buffers applicable as of the date presented. Failure to maintain the buffers would result in restrictions on the ability to make capital distributions, including the payment of dividends.
Additionally, MSBNA is conditionally registered with the SEC as a security-based swap dealer and is registered with the CFTC as a swap dealer. However, as MSBNA is prudentially regulated as a bank, its capital requirements continue to be determined by the OCC.
Other Regulatory Capital Requirements
MS&Co. Regulatory Capital
MS&Co. is registered as a broker-dealer and a futures commission merchant with the SEC and the CFTC,
respectively, and is registered as a swap dealer with the CFTC.
As an Alternative Net Capital broker-dealer, and in accordance with Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) Rule 15c3-1, Appendix E, MS&Co. is subject to minimum net capital and tentative net capital requirements and operates with capital in excess of its regulatory capital requirements. As a futures commission merchant and registered swap dealer, MS&Co. is subject to CFTC capital requirements. In addition, MS&Co. must notify the SEC if its tentative net capital falls below certain levels. At March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, MS&Co. exceeded its net capital requirement and had tentative net capital in excess of the minimum and notification requirements.
Other Regulated Subsidiaries
Certain other subsidiaries are also subject to various regulatory capital requirements. Such subsidiaries include the following, each of which operated with capital in excess of their respective regulatory capital requirements as of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, as applicable:
•
MSSB,
•
MSIP,
•
MSESE,
•
MSMS,
•
MSCS, and
•
MSCG.

Share Repurchases
On June 28, 2024, the Firm announced that its Board of Directors reauthorized a multi-year repurchase program of up to $
20
billion of outstanding common stock (the “Share Repurchase Authorization”), without a set expiration date, beginning in the third quarter of 2024, which will be exercised from time to time as conditions warrant.

Dividend income is included within equity contracts.
The previous table summarizes realized and unrealized gains and losses primarily related to the Firm’s Trading assets and liabilities, from derivative and non-derivative financial instruments, included in Trading revenues in the income statement. The Firm generally utilizes financial instruments across a variety of product types in connection with its market-making and related risk management strategies. The trading revenues presented in the table are not representative of the manner in which the Firm manages its business activities and are prepared in a manner similar to the presentation of trading revenues for regulatory reporting purposes.
Investment Management Investments Revenues—Net Cumulative Unrealized Carried Interest
The Firm’s portion of net cumulative performance-based fees in the form of unrealized carried interest, for which the Firm is not obligated to pay compensation, is at risk of reversing when the returns in certain funds fall below specified performance targets. See Note 13 for information regarding general partner guarantees, which include potential obligations to return performance fee distributions previously received.
Investment Management Asset Management Revenues—Reduction of Fees Due to Fee Waivers
The Firm waives a portion of its fees in the Investment Management business segment from certain registered money market funds that comply with the requirements of Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act of 1940.
Certain Other Fee Waivers
Separately, the Firm’s employees, including its senior officers, may participate on the same terms and conditions as other investors in certain funds that the Firm sponsors primarily for client investment, and the Firm may waive or lower applicable fees and charges for its employees.
Other Expenses—Transaction Taxes
Transaction taxes are composed of securities transaction taxes and stamp duties, which are levied on the sale or purchase of securities listed on recognized stock exchanges in certain markets. These taxes are imposed mainly on trades of equity securities in Asia and EMEA. Similar transaction taxes are levied on trades of listed derivative instruments in certain countries.
