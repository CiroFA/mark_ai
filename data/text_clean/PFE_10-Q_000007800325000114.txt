Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies
A.
Basis of Presentation
We prepared these condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP, consistent in all material respects with those applied in our 2024 Form 10-K. As permitted under the SEC requirements for interim reporting, certain footnotes or other financial information have been condensed or omitted.
These financial statements include all normal and recurring adjustments that are considered necessary for the fair statement of results for the interim periods presented. The information included in this Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in our 2024 Form 10-K
.
Revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities can vary during each quarter of the year. Therefore, the results and trends in these interim financial statements may not be representative of those for the full year.
Pfizer’s fiscal quarter-end for subsidiaries operating outside the U.S. is as of and for the three months ended February 23, 2025 and February 25, 2024, and for U.S. subsidiaries is as of and for the three months ended March 30, 2025 and March 31, 2024.
We manage our commercial operations through
three
operating segments, each led by a single manager: Biopharma, PC1 and Pfizer Ignite. Biopharma is the only reportable segment. See
Note 13A
.
B.
Revenues and Trade Accounts Receivable
Trade Accounts Receivable––
Trade accounts receivable are stated at their net realizable value. The allowance for credit losses reflects our best estimate of expected credit losses of the receivables portfolio determined on the basis of historical experience, current information, and forecasts of future economic conditions. In developing the estimate for expected credit losses, trade accounts receivables are segmented into pools of assets depending on market (U.S. versus international), delinquency status, and customer type (high risk versus low risk and government versus non-government), and fixed reserve percentages are established for each pool of trade accounts receivables.
In determining the reserve percentages for each pool of trade accounts receivables, we considered our historical experience with certain customers and customer types, regulatory and legal environments, country and political risk, and other relevant current and future forecasted macroeconomic factors. When management becomes aware of certain customer-specific factors that impact credit risk, specific allowances for these known troubled accounts are recorded.
During the three months ended March 30, 2025 and March 31, 2024, additions to the allowance for credit losses, write-offs and recoveries of customer receivables were not material to our condensed consolidated financial statements. For additional information on our trade accounts receivable, see
Note 1G
in our 2024 Form 10-K.
Note 2.
Research and Development Arrangement
Research and Development Funding Arrangement with Blackstone
––In March 2025, we entered into an arrangement with Blackstone under which we will receive up to a total of $
326
million in 2025 through 2028 to co-fund our quarterly development costs for specified treatments. As there is substantive transfer of risk to the financial partner, the development funding is recognized by us as an obligation to perform contractual services. We are recognizing the funding as a reduction of
Research and development expenses
using an attribution model over the period of the related expenses. If successful, upon regulatory approval in the U.S. or certain major markets in the EU for the indications based on the applicable clinical trials, Blackstone will be eligible to receive approval-based fixed milestone payments of up to $
277
million contingent upon the successful results of the clinical trials and payable to Blackstone over a period of
one
to
three
years. Following potential regulatory approval, Blackstone will be eligible to receive a combination of fixed milestone payments of up to $
897
million in total based on achievement of certain levels of cumulative applicable net sales and payable to Blackstone over a period of
five

Restructuring Charges and Other Costs Associated with Acquisitions and Cost-Reduction/Productivity Initiatives
A. Realigning Our Cost Base Program
•
In the fourth quarter of 2023, we announced that we launched a multi-year, enterprise-wide cost realignment program that aims to realign our costs with our longer-term revenue expectations. We expect costs associated with this initial part of the program to continue primarily through 2025 and to total approximately $
3.1
billion, primarily representing cash expenditures for severance, exit and implementation costs as well as non-cash asset write downs of which $
2.4
billion is associated with our Biopharma segment.
•
In the second quarter of 2025, we identified additional productivity opportunities to further reduce costs primarily in SI&A, driven in large part by enhanced digital enablement, including automation and AI, and simplification of business processes. We expect costs associated with the additional productivity opportunities to be incurred through 2027 and to total approximately $
1.6
billion, primarily representing cash expenditures for severance, digital enablement and implementation, of which $
700
million is associated with our Biopharma segment.
•
In connection with our efforts to simplify the structure and sharpen the focus of our R&D organization, in the first quarter of 2025 we expanded this program after having identified additional opportunities to drive improvements in productivity and operational efficiencies through enhanced digital enablement, including automation and AI, and simplification of business processes. We expect costs to implement these initiatives to be incurred through 2026 and to total approximately $
600
million, primarily representing cash expenditures for severance, digital enablement and implementation, all of which is associated with our Biopharma segment. The majority of these costs were recorded in the first quarter of 2025, with cash outlays expected primarily in 2025 and 2026.
We now expect costs associated with all three components of this program to total approximately $
5.3
billion of which $
3.7
billion is associated with the Biopharma segment.
From the start of this program through March 30, 2025, we incurred total costs under this program of $
3.2
billion, of which $
2.7
billion is associated with our Biopharma segment (including $
2.5
billion of restructuring charges).
B. Manufacturing Optimization Program
In the second quarter of 2024, we announced that we launched a multi-year, multi-phased program to reduce our costs of goods sold, which is expected to include operational efficiencies, network structure changes, and product portfolio enhancements. The first phase of this program is focused on operational efficiencies and we expect costs for this first phase to total approximately $
1.6
billion, primarily representing cash expenditures for severance and implementation costs, all of which is associated with our Biopharma segment. From the start of this program through March 30, 2025, we incurred costs under this program of $
1.2
billion, substantially all of which is restructuring costs for our Biopharma segment. These costs were recorded primarily in 2024, with cash outlays expected primarily in 2025 and 2026.

587
million for our Realigning our Cost Base Program and credits of $
4
million for our Manufacturing Optimization Program) and credits of $
37

Note 4.
Other (Income)/Deductions—Net
(a)
The decrease in net interest expense in the first quarter of 2025, compared to the first quarter of 2024, reflects (i) lower interest expense mainly due to lower long-term debt and commercial paper balances and (ii) an increase in interest income primarily due to higher cash balances from sales of our remaining investment in Haleon.
(b)
The net losses in the first quarter of 2025 include, among other things, a net loss of $
144
million related to our investment in Haleon, composed of unrealized losses of $
1.0
billion, partially offset by $
900
million in realized gains on the sales of our remaining investment.
(c)
The amount for the first quarter of 2025 primarily includes certain product liability and other legal expenses related to products discontinued and/or divested by Pfizer. The amount for the first quarter of 2024 primarily included certain product liability expenses related to products discontinued and/or divested by Pfizer.
(d)
The amount for the first quarter of 2025 primarily represents an intangible asset impairment charge associated with our Biopharma segment of $
210
million for KRAS G12D, a Phase 2 indefinite-lived out-licensed asset that was discontinued by our out-licensing partner. The amount for the first quarter of 2024 represented intangible asset impairment charges associated with our Biopharma segment for developed technology rights due to updated commercial forecasts mainly reflecting competitive pressures.
(e)
The first quarter of 2024 primarily i
ncluded, among other things,
a $
150
million realized gain on the partial sale of our investment in Haleon.
(a)
The fair value amount is presented as of the date of impairment, as this asset is not measured at fair value on a recurring basis. See also
Note 1E
in our 2024 Form 10-K
.
(b)
Reflects intangible assets written down to fair value in 2025. Fair value was determined using the income approach, specifically the multi-period excess earnings method, also known as the discounted cash flow method. We started with a forecast of all the expected net cash flows for the asset and then applied an asset-specific discount rate to arrive at a net present value amount. Some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in this approach include: the amount and timing of the projected net cash flows, which includes the expected impact of competitive, legal and/or regulatory forces on the product; and assumptions about the probability of technical and regulatory success (PTRS) of ongoing clinical trials, the discount rate, which seeks to reflect the various risks inherent in the projected cash flows; and the tax rate, which seeks to incorporate the geographic diversity of the projected cash flows.

Tax Matters
A. Taxes on Income/(Loss) from Continuing Operations
Our effective tax rate for continuing operations was (
6.8
)% for the first quarter of 2025, compared to
8.6
% for the first quarter of 2024. The negative and lower effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2025, compared to the first quarter of 2024, was primarily due to favorable global income tax resolutions in multiple tax jurisdictions spanning multiple tax years, as well as a favorable change in the jurisdictional mix of earnings.
We elected, with the filing of our 2018 U.S. Federal Consolidated Income Tax Return, to pay our initial estimated $
15
billion repatriation tax liability on accumulated post-1986 foreign earnings (Transition Tax liability) over eight years through 2026. The seventh annual installment was paid by its April 15, 2025 due date and is reported in current
Income taxes payable
as of March 30, 2025. The remaining liability is reported in noncurrent
Other taxes payable.
Our obligations may vary due to the availability of attributes such as foreign tax and other credit carryforwards or carrybacks.
See
Note 5A
in our 2024 Form 10-K for information on our cash paid for income taxes, net of refunds.

B. Tax Contingencies
We are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions, and a certain degree of estimation is required in recording the assets and liabilities related to income taxes. All of our tax positions are subject to audit by the local taxing authorities in each tax jurisdiction. These tax audits can involve complex issues, interpretations and judgments and the resolution of matters may span multiple years, particularly if subject to negotiation or litigation.
The U.S. is one of our major tax jurisdictions, and we are regularly audited by the IRS. Tax years 2019 - 2022 are under audit. The IRS audit of Pfizer’s federal income tax returns for years 2016-2018 is effectively settled but the statute of limitation remains open for these tax years. Tax years 2023-2025 are open but not under audit. All other tax years are closed. In addition to the open audit years in the U.S., we have open audit years and certain related audits, appeals and investigations in certain major international tax jurisdictions dating back to 2014.
See
Note 5D
in our 2024 Form 10-K.
C. Tax Provision/(Benefit) on Other Comprehensive Income/(Loss)
(a)
Taxes are not provided for foreign currency translation adjustments relating to investments in international subsidiaries that are expected to be held indefinitely.

Financial Instruments
A. Fair Value Measurements
Financial Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis and Fair Value Hierarchy, using a Market Approach:
(a)
Includes money market funds primarily invested in U.S. Treasury and government debt. As of December 31, 2024, short-term equity securities included our investment in Haleon of $
6.5
billion
.
In the first quarter of 2025, we sold the remaining portion of our investment in Haleon for $
6.3
billion.
(b)
Long-term equity securities of $
132
million as of March 30, 2025 and $
133
million as of December 31, 2024 were held in restricted trusts for U.S. non-qualified employee benefit plans.
(c)
Includes life insurance policies held in restricted trusts for U.S. non-qualified employee benefit plans. The underlying invested assets in these contracts are marketable securities, which are carried at fair value, with changes in fair value recognized in
Other (income)/deductions—net
(see
Note 4
).
Financial Assets and Liabilities Not Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis––
The carrying value of Long-term debt, excluding the current portion, was $
58
billion as of March 30, 2025 and $
57
billion as of December 31, 2024. The estimated fair value of such debt, using a market approach and Level 2 inputs, was $
55
billion as of March 30, 2025 and $
54
billion as of December 31, 2024.
The differences between the estimated fair values and carrying values of held-to-maturity debt securities, private equity securities, long-term receivables and short-term borrowings not measured at fair value on a recurring basis were not significant as of March 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024. The fair value measurements of our held-to-maturity debt securities and short-term borrowings are based on Level 2 inputs. The fair value measurements of our long-term receivables and private equity securities are based on Level 3 inputs.

C. Short-Term Borrowings
(a)
Primarily includes cash collateral. See
Note 7F
.
D. Long-Term Debt
E. Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities
Foreign Exchange Risk––
A significant portion of our revenues, earnings and net investments in foreign affiliates is exposed to changes in foreign exchange rates. Where foreign exchange risk is not offset by other exposures, we manage our foreign exchange risk principally through the use of derivative financial instruments and foreign currency debt. These financial instruments serve to mitigate the impact on net income as a result of remeasurement into another currency, or against the impact of translation into U.S. dollars of certain foreign exchange-denominated transactions.
The derivative financial instruments primarily hedge or offset exposures in the euro, U.K. pound, Japanese yen, Chinese renminbi, Canadian dollar and Swedish krona, and include a portion of our forecasted foreign exchange-denominated intercompany inventory sales hedged up to
two years
. We may also seek to protect against possible declines in the net investments of our foreign business entities.
Interest Rate Risk––
Our interest-bearing investments and borrowings are subject to interest rate risk. Depending on market conditions, we may change the profile of our outstanding debt or investments by entering into derivative financial instruments like interest rate swaps, either to hedge or offset the exposure to changes in the fair value of hedged items with fixed interest rates, or to convert variable rate debt or investments to fixed rates. The derivative financial instruments primarily hedge U.S. dollar fixed-rate debt.
(a)
The notional amount of outstanding foreign exchange contracts hedging our intercompany forecasted inventory sales was $
4.9
billion as of March 30, 2025 and $
5.0
billion as of December 31, 2024.

PFIZER INC. AND SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES
NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(UNAUDITED)
With respect to our derivative financial instrument agreements with financial institutions, we do not expect to incur a significant loss from failure of any counterparty. Derivative financial instruments are executed under International Swaps and Derivatives Association master agreements with credit-support annexes that contain zero threshold provisions requiring collateral to be exchanged daily depending on levels of exposure. As a result, there are no significant concentrations of credit risk with any individual financial institution. As of March 30, 2025, the aggregate fair value of these derivative financial instruments that are in a net payable position was $
646
million, for which we have posted collateral of $
640
million with a corresponding amount reported in
Short-term investments
. As of March 30, 2025, the aggregate fair value of our derivative financial instruments that are in a net receivable position was $

Contingencies and Certain Commitments
We and certain of our subsidiaries are subject to numerous contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business, including tax and legal contingencies, guarantees and indemnifications. The following outlines our legal contingencies, guarantees and indemnifications. For a discussion of our tax contingencies, see
Note 5B
.
A. Legal Proceedings
Our legal contingencies include, but are not limited to, the following:
•
Patent litigation, which typically involves challenges to the coverage and/or validity of patents on various products, processes or dosage forms. An adverse outcome could result in loss of patent protection for a product, a significant loss of revenues from a product or impairment of the value of associated assets. We are the plaintiff in the majority of these actions.
20
PFIZER INC. AND SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES
NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(UNAUDITED)
•
Product liability and other product-related litigation related to current or former products, which can include personal injury, consumer fraud, off-label promotion, securities, antitrust and breach of contract claims, among others, and often involves highly complex issues relating to medical causation, label warnings and reliance on those warnings, scientific evidence and findings, actual, provable injury and other matters.
•
Commercial and other asserted or unasserted matters, which can include acquisition-, licensing-, intellectual property-, collaboration- or co-promotion-related and product-pricing claims and environmental claims and proceedings, and can involve complexities that will vary from matter to matter.
•
Government investigations, which often are related to the extensive regulation of pharmaceutical companies by national, state and local government agencies in the U.S. and in other jurisdictions.
Certain of these contingencies could result in increased expenses and/or losses, including damages, royalty payments, fines and/or civil penalties, which could be substantial, and/or criminal charges.
We believe that our claims and defenses in matters in which we are a defendant are substantial, but litigation is inherently unpredictable and excessive verdicts do occur. We do not believe that any of these matters will have a material adverse effect on our financial position. However, we could incur judgments, enter into settlements or revise our expectations regarding the outcome of matters, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and/or our cash flows in the period in which the amounts are accrued or paid.
We have accrued for losses that are both probable and reasonably estimable. Substantially all of our contingencies are subject to significant uncertainties and, therefore, determining the likelihood of a loss and/or the measurement of any loss can be complex. Consequently, we are unable to estimate the range of reasonably possible loss in excess of amounts accrued. Our assessments, which result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties, are based on estimates and assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by management, but that may prove to be incomplete or inaccurate, and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that might cause us to change those estimates and assumptions.
Amounts recorded for legal and environmental contingencies can result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and can rely heavily on estimates and assumptions. For proceedings under environmental laws to which a governmental authority is a party, we have adopted a disclosure threshold of $
1
million in potential or actual governmental monetary sanctions.
The principal pending matters to which we are a party are discussed below. In determining whether a pending matter is a principal matter, we consider both quantitative and qualitative factors to assess materiality, such as, among others, the amount of damages and the nature of other relief sought, if specified; our view of the merits of the claims and of the strength of our defenses; whether the action purports to be, or is, a class action and, if not certified, our view of the likelihood that a class will be certified by the court; the jurisdiction in which the proceeding is pending; whether related actions have been transferred to multidistrict litigation; any experience that we or, to our knowledge, other companies have had in similar proceedings; whether disclosure of the action would be important to a reader of our financial statements, including whether disclosure might change a reader’s judgment about our financial statements in light of all of the information that is available to the reader; the potential impact of the proceeding on our reputation; and the extent of public interest in the matter. In addition, with respect to patent matters in which we are the plaintiff, we consider, among other things, the financial significance of the product protected by the patent(s) at issue. Some of the matters discussed below include those which management believes that the likelihood of possible loss in excess of amounts accrued is remote.
A1. Legal Proceedings––Patent Litigation
We are involved in suits relating to our patents (or those of our collaboration/licensing partners to which we have licenses or co-promotion rights), including but not limited to, those discussed below. We face claims by generic drug manufacturers that patents covering our products (or those of our collaboration/licensing partners to which we have licenses or co-promotion rights and to which we may or may not be a party), processes or dosage forms are invalid and/or do not cover the product of the generic drug manufacturer. Also, counterclaims, as well as various independent actions, have been filed alleging that our assertions of, or attempts to enforce, patent rights with respect to certain products constitute unfair competition and/or violations of antitrust laws. In addition to the challenges to the U.S. patents that are discussed below, patent rights to certain of our products or those of our collaboration/licensing partners are being challenged in various other jurisdictions. Some of our collaboration or licensing partners face challenges to the validity of their patent rights in non-U.S. jurisdictions. For example, in April 2022, the U.K. High Court issued a judgment finding invalid a BMS patent related to Eliquis due to expire in 2026. In May 2023, the Court of Appeal dismissed BMS’s appeal and in October 2023, the Supreme Court refused BMS permission to appeal. Additional challenges are pending in other jurisdictions. Also, in July 2022, CureVac AG (CureVac) brought a patent infringement action against BioNTech and certain of its subsidiaries in the German Regional Court alleging that Comirnaty infringes certain German utility model patents and certain expired and unexpired European patents. Additional challenges
21
PFIZER INC. AND SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES
NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(UNAUDITED)
involving Comirnaty patents may be filed against us and/or BioNTech in other jurisdictions in the future. Adverse decisions in these matters could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
We are also party to patent damages suits in various jurisdictions pursuant to which generic drug manufacturers, payors, governments or other parties are seeking damages from us for allegedly causing delay of generic entry.
We also are often involved in other proceedings, such as inter partes review, post-grant review, re-examination or opposition proceedings, before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, the European Patent Office, or other foreign counterparts, as well as court proceedings relating to our intellectual property or the intellectual property rights of others, including challenges to such rights initiated by us. Also, if one of our patents (or one of our collaboration/licensing partner’s patents) is found to be invalid by such proceedings, generic or competitive products could be introduced into the market resulting in the erosion of sales of our existing products. For example, several of the patents in our pneumococcal vaccine portfolio have been challenged in inter partes review and post-grant review proceedings in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, as well as outside the U.S.
The invalidation of any of the patents in our pneumococcal portfolio could potentially allow additional competitor vaccines, if approved, to enter the marketplace earlier than anticipated. In the event that any of the patents are found valid and infringed, a competitor’s vaccine, if approved, might be prohibited from entering the market or a competitor might be required to pay us a royalty.
We are also subject to patent litigation pursuant to which one or more third parties seek damages and/or injunctive relief to compensate for alleged infringement of its patents by our commercial or other activities. If one of our marketed products (or a product of our collaboration/licensing partners to which we have licenses or co-promotion rights) is found to infringe valid patent rights of a third party, such third party may be awarded significant damages or royalty payments, or we may be prevented from further sales of that product. Such damages may be enhanced as much as three-fold if we or one of our subsidiaries is found to have willfully infringed valid patent rights of a third party.
Actions In Which We Are The Plaintiff
Xeljanz (tofacitinib)
Beginning in 2017, we brought patent-infringement actions against several generic manufacturers that filed separate abbreviated new drug applications (ANDAs) with the FDA seeking approval to market their generic versions of tofacitinib tablets in one or both of 5 mg and 10 mg dosage strengths, and in both immediate and extended release forms. To date, we have settled actions with several manufacturers on terms not material to us. The remaining actions continue in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware as described below.
In December 2024, we brought a patent infringement action against Alkem Laboratories Ltd. (Alkem) asserting the infringement and validity of our composition of matter patent, covering immediate release formulations of tofacitinib that was challenged by Alkem in its ANDA seeking approval to market a generic version of tofacitinib 5 mg and 10 mg immediate release tablets. In February 2025, we settled the action against Alkem on terms not material to us.
In April 2025, we brought a patent infringement action against Annora Pharma Private Limited (Annora) asserting the infringement and validity of our composition of matter patent, covering immediate release formulations of tofacitinib that was challenged by Annora in its ANDA seeking approval to market a generic version of tofacitinib 5 mg and 10 mg immediate release tablets.
Mektovi (binimetinib)
Beginning in August 2022,
two
generic companies notified us that they had filed ANDAs with the FDA seeking approval to market generic versions of Mektovi. The companies assert the invalidity and non-infringement of
two
method of use patents expiring in 2030, a method of use patent expiring in 2031,
two
method of use patents expiring in 2033, and a product by process patent expiring in 2033. Beginning in September 2022, we brought patent infringement actions against both of the generic filers in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware, asserting the validity and infringement of all
six
patents. In January 2025, we settled with
one
of the generic companies on terms not material to us.
In August 2022, we received notice from Teva Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Teva) that it had filed an ANDA seeking approval to market a generic version of Mektovi. Teva asserts the invalidity and non-infringement of
two
method of use patents expiring in 2033 and a product by process patent expiring in 2033. In June 2023, we brought a patent infringement action against Teva in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware, asserting the validity and infringement of the
three
patents.
Vyndaqel-Vyndamax (tafamidis/tafamidis meglumine)
Beginning in June 2023, several generic companies notified us that they had filed ANDAs with the FDA seeking approval to market generic versions of tafamidis capsules (61 mg) or tafamidis meglumine capsules (20 mg), challenging some or all of the patents listed in the FDA’s Orange Book for Vyndamax (tafamidis) and Vyndaqel (tafamidis meglumine). Scripps Research Institute (Scripps) owns the composition of matter patent and the method of treatment patents covering the products, and Pfizer
22
PFIZER INC. AND SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES
NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

is the exclusive licensee. Pfizer separately owns the crystalline form patent. Beginning in August 2023, we and Scripps brought patent infringement actions against the generic filers in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware, asserting the validity and infringement of the patents in suit. Pfizer is the sole plaintiff in actions that assert only the infringement and validity of the crystalline form patent.
Oxbryta (voxelotor)
In January 2024, Zydus Pharmaceuticals (USA) Inc., Zydus Lifesciences Limited, and Zydus Worldwide DMCC (collectively, Zydus) and MSN Pharmaceuticals Inc. and MSN Laboratories Private Ltd. (collectively, MSN) separately notified us that they had filed ANDAs with the FDA seeking approval to market generic versions of voxelotor tablets, challenging some of the patents listed in the FDA’s Orange Book for Oxbryta (voxelotor tablets in 300 mg and 500 mg strengths and/or for oral suspension) on non-infringement grounds. In March 2024, we filed patent infringement actions against both generic filers in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware, asserting the validity and infringement of the challenged patents. Zydus and MSN have not challenged our composition of matter patents or method of treatment patents for Oxbryta.
Nurtec (rimegepant)
In April 2024, Rubicon Research Private Limited, Teva Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Changzhou Pharmaceutical Factory, Natco Pharma Limited and Natco Pharma, Inc., MSN, Aurobindo Pharma Limited, Apitoria Pharma Private Limited and Aurobindo Pharma U.S.A. Inc. (collectively, Aurobindo) and Apotex Inc. and Apotex Corp. (collectively, Apotex) notified us that they had filed ANDAs with the FDA seeking approval to market generic versions of rimegepant orally disintegrating tablets, claiming noninfringement and/or challenging the validity of some or all of the patents listed in the FDA’s Orange Book for Nurtec (rimegepant orally disintegrating tablets Eq 75 mg base). In May 2024, we filed patent infringement actions against all the generic filers in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware.
Xtandi (enzalutamide)
Beginning in August 2024, several generic companies notified us and Astellas that they had filed ANDAs with the FDA seeking approval to market generic versions of Xtandi, challenging some or all of the patents listed in the FDA’s Orange Book for Xtandi. Beginning in August 2024, we brought patent infringement actions against the generic filers in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey, asserting the validity and infringement of the patents in suit.
Inlyta (axitinib)
In October 2024, Sandoz Inc. (Sandoz) notified us that it had filed an ANDA with the FDA seeking approval to market a generic version of Inlyta. Sandoz asserts the invalidity and non-infringement of the crystalline form patent for Inlyta that expires in 2030. In November 2024, we filed suit against Sandoz in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware, asserting the validity and infringement of the crystalline form patent for Inlyta.
Actions in Which We are the Defendant
Comirnaty (tozinameran)
In March 2022, Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Alnylam) filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware against Pfizer and Pharmacia & Upjohn Company LLC, our wholly owned subsidiary, alleging that Comirnaty infringes a U.S. patent issued in February 2022, and seeking unspecified monetary damages. In July 2022, Alnylam filed a second complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware against Pfizer, Pharmacia & Upjohn Company LLC, BioNTech and BioNTech Manufacturing GmbH, alleging that Comirnaty infringes a U.S. patent issued in July 2022, and seeking unspecified monetary damages. In May 2023, Alnylam filed a separate complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware against Pfizer and Pharmacia & Upjohn Company LLC alleging that Comirnaty infringes
four
additional U.S. patents issued on various dates in 2023 and seeking unspecified monetary damages. In February 2025,
one
of the patents asserted in the May 2023 complaint was dismissed from the litigation by stipulation of the parties. In August 2022, ModernaTX, Inc. (ModernaTX) and Moderna US, Inc. (Moderna) sued Pfizer, BioNTech, BioNTech Manufacturing GmbH and BioNTech US Inc. in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts, alleging that Comirnaty infringes
three
U.S. patents. In its complaint, Moderna stated that it is seeking damages for alleged infringement occurring after March 7, 2022. In March 2024, the U.S. Patent Office Patent Trial & Appeal Board instituted a review of
two
of the
three
patents in suit. In March 2025, the U.S. Patent Office issued a decision holding that the
two
Moderna patents were invalid.
In August 2022, ModernaTX filed a patent infringement action in Germany against Pfizer and certain subsidiary companies, as well as BioNTech and certain subsidiary companies, alleging that Comirnaty infringes
two
European patents. In March 2025, a German court found the asserted patents infringed; no decision on invalidity was rendered. In September 2022, ModernaTX filed patent infringement actions in the U.K. and in the Netherlands against Pfizer and certain subsidiary companies, as well as BioNTech and certain subsidiary companies, on the same
two
European patents. In its complaints, ModernaTX stated that it is seeking damages for alleged infringement occurring after March 7, 2022. In November 2023,
one
of the European patents was revoked by the European Patent Office. In December 2023, the other European patent was declared invalid by a court in the
23
PFIZER INC. AND SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES
NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(UNAUDITED)
Netherlands (the invalidity decision is limited to the Netherlands). In July 2024, the U.K. court revoked
one
patent, ruling that it was invalid, and held that the other patent was valid and infringed. ModernaTX has also filed additional patent infringement actions against Pfizer and BioNTech in certain other ex-U.S. jurisdictions.
In April 2023, Arbutus Biopharma Corporation (Arbutus) and Genevant Sciences GmbH (Genevant) filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey against Pfizer and BioNTech alleging that Comirnaty and its manufacture infringe
five
U.S. patents, and seeking unspecified monetary damages.
In April 2024, GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals SA and GlaxoSmithKline LLC (collectively, GSK Group) sued Pfizer and Pharmacia & Upjohn Company LLC, BioNTech, BioNTech Manufacturing GmbH and BioNTech US Inc. in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware, alleging that Comirnaty infringes
five
U.S. patents and seeking unspecified money damages. In August 2024, GSK Group filed an amended complaint alleging that Comirnaty infringes
three
additional U.S. patents.
In January 2025, Promosome LLC filed a complaint in the Unified Patent Court, Local Division Munich, against Pfizer and BioNTech and certain of their subsidiaries alleging that Comirnaty infringes a European patent that is in force only in France, Germany and Sweden, and seeking unspecified monetary damages in connection with the manufacture and sale of Comirnaty in France, Germany and Sweden.
Paxlovid
In June 2022, Enanta Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Enanta) filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts against Pfizer alleging that the active ingredient in Paxlovid, nirmatrelvir, infringes a U.S.
patent issued in June 2022, and seeking unspecified monetary damages. In December
2024, the District Court issued an order granting Pfizer’s motion for summary judgment, finding Enanta’s patent invalid.
Abrysvo
In August 2023, GSK Group filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware against Pfizer alleging that the active ingredient in Abrysvo infringes
four
U.S. patents. In November 2023, GSK Group amended its complaint to assert infringement of
two
additional patents. In November 2024, the GSK Group filed a second amended complaint, adding a
seven
th patent to the lawsuit. The second amended complaint seeks unspecified monetary damages and a permanent injunction against sales of Abrysvo for use in adults in age ranges for which GSK Group’s Arexvy product is also indicated.
In addition, we have challenged certain of GSK’s RSV vaccine patents in certain ex-U.S. jurisdictions, including the U.K., the Netherlands, Belgium and the Unified Patent Court, and GSK has asserted that Abrysvo infringes these patents.
In October 2024, the U.K. Court held that
two
of GSK’s U.K. patents were invalid and not infringed. In April 2025, the Company settled all of the patent disputes related to Abrysvo on terms not material to Pfizer.
Matters Involving Pfizer and its Collaboration/Licensing Partners
Comirnaty (tozinameran)
In July 2022, Pfizer, BioNTech and BioNTech Manufacturing GmbH filed a declaratory judgment complaint against CureVac in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts seeking a judgment of non-infringement for
three
U.S. patents relating to Comirnaty. In May 2023, the case was transferred to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia. Also in May 2023, CureVac asserted that Comirnaty infringes the
three
patents that were the subject of our declaratory judgment complaint, and in May and July 2023, CureVac asserted that Comirnaty infringes a number of additional U.S. patents.
In the U.K., Pfizer and BioNTech have sued CureVac seeking a judgment of invalidity of several patents and CureVac has made certain infringement counterclaims. In September 2024, the U.K. Court held that both of the CureVac patents in suit are invalid. In January 2025, the U.K. Court rejected CureVac’s request for permission to appeal.
Orgovyx (relugolix)
Beginning in January 2025, several generic companies notified us that they had filed ANDAs with the FDA seeking approval to sell a generic form of relugolix (Orgovyx), and challenging one or more patents listed in the FDA’s Orange Book for Orgovyx which are licensed to Pfizer. In March 2025, we, along with Sumitomo Pharma Switzerland GBBH, Sumitomo Pharma America, Inc., Takeda and Takeda Pharmaceuticals International AG jointly filed separate patent infringement actions in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware against the generic companies, asserting the infringement and validity of the patents in suit.
A2. Legal Proceedings––Product Litigation
We are defendants in numerous cases, including but not limited to those discussed below, related to our pharmaceutical and other products. Plaintiffs in these cases seek damages and other relief on various grounds for alleged personal injury and economic loss.

(UNAUDITED)
Asbestos
Between 1967 and 1982, Warner-Lambert owned American Optical Corporation (American Optical), which manufactured and sold respiratory protective devices and asbestos safety clothing. In connection with the sale of American Optical in 1982, Warner-Lambert agreed to indemnify the purchaser for certain liabilities, including certain asbestos-related and other claims. Warner-Lambert was acquired by Pfizer in 2000 and is a wholly owned subsidiary of Pfizer. Warner-Lambert is actively engaged in the defense of, and will continue to explore various means of resolving, these claims.
Numerous lawsuits against American Optical, Pfizer and certain of its previously owned subsidiaries are pending in various federal and state courts seeking damages for alleged personal injury from exposure to products allegedly containing asbestos and other allegedly hazardous materials sold by Pfizer and certain of its previously owned subsidiaries.
There also are a small number of lawsuits pending in various federal and state courts seeking damages for alleged exposure to asbestos in facilities owned or formerly owned by Pfizer or its subsidiaries.
Docetaxel
A number of lawsuits have been filed against Hospira and Pfizer in various federal and state courts alleging that plaintiffs who were treated with Docetaxel developed permanent hair loss. Hospira is a wholly-owned subsidiary that we acquired in September 2015. The significant majority of the cases also name other defendants, including the manufacturer of the branded product, Taxotere. Plaintiffs seek compensatory and punitive damages. Additional lawsuits have been filed in which plaintiffs allege they developed blocked tear ducts following their treatment with Docetaxel.
In 2016, the federal cases were transferred for coordinated pre-trial proceedings to an MDL in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana. In 2022, the eye injury cases were transferred for coordinated pre-trial proceedings to an MDL in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana.
Zantac
A number of lawsuits have been filed against Pfizer in various federal and state courts alleging that plaintiffs developed various types of cancer, or face an increased risk of developing cancer, purportedly as a result of the ingestion of Zantac. The significant majority of these cases also name other defendants that have historically manufactured and/or sold Zantac. Pfizer has not sold Zantac since 2006, and only sold an OTC version of the product. In 2006, Pfizer sold the consumer business that included its Zantac OTC rights to Johnson & Johnson and transferred the assets and liabilities related to Zantac OTC to Johnson & Johnson in connection with the sale. Plaintiffs in these cases seek compensatory and punitive damages.
In February 2020, the federal actions were transferred for coordinated pre-trial proceedings to an MDL in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida (the Federal MDL Court). Plaintiffs in the MDL filed against Pfizer and many other defendants a master personal injury complaint, a consolidated consumer class action complaint alleging, among other things, claims under consumer protection statutes of all 50 states, and a medical monitoring complaint seeking to certify medical monitoring classes under the laws of 13 states. In December 2022, the Federal MDL Court granted defendants’ Daubert motions to exclude plaintiffs’ expert testimony and motion for summary judgment on general causation, which has resulted in the dismissal of all complaints in the litigation. Plaintiffs have appealed the Federal MDL Court’s rulings.
In addition, (i) Pfizer has received service of Canadian class action complaints naming Pfizer and other defendants, and seeking compensatory and punitive damages for personal injury and economic loss, allegedly arising from the defendants’ sale of Zantac in Canada; and (ii) the State of New Mexico and the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore separately filed civil actions against Pfizer and many other defendants in state courts, alleging various state statutory and common law claims in connection with the defendants’ alleged sale of Zantac in those jurisdictions. In April 2021, a Judicial Council Coordinated Proceeding was created in the Superior Court of California in Alameda County to coordinate personal injury actions against Pfizer and other defendants filed in California state court. Coordinated proceedings have also been created in other state courts. The large majority of the state court cases have been filed in the Superior Court of Delaware in New Castle County.
Many of these Zantac-related cases have been outstanding for a number of years and could take many more years to resolve. From time to time, Pfizer has explored and will continue to explore opportunistic settlements of these matters. As of April 2025, Pfizer had settled, or entered into definitive agreements or agreements-in-principle to settle, subject to certain conditions, a substantial majority of the cases filed in state courts in which the plaintiff alleges use of a Pfizer product. The remaining unresolved state court cases continue in various state courts.
Chantix
Beginning in August 2021, a number of putative class actions have been filed against Pfizer in various U.S. federal courts following Pfizer’s voluntary recall of Chantix due to the presence of a nitrosamine, N-nitroso-varenicline. Plaintiffs assert that they suffered economic harm purportedly as a result of purchasing Chantix or generic varenicline medicines sold by Pfizer. Plaintiffs seek to represent nationwide and state-specific classes and seek various remedies, including damages and medical monitoring. In December 2022, the federal actions were transferred for coordinated pre-trial proceedings to an MDL in the U.S.

District Court for the Southern District of New York. Similar putative class actions in Canada and Israel, where the product brand is Champix, have been dismissed.
Depo-Provera
A number of lawsuits have been filed against Pfizer and certain subsidiaries in various federal and state courts alleging that plaintiffs who used the injectable version of Depo-Provera (active ingredient medroxyprogesterone acetate, or MPA) for contraception developed meningioma. The cases also name other defendants, including the manufacturers of generic versions of injectable MPA for contraception. Plaintiffs assert claims against Pfizer relating to both Depo-Provera and generic MPA products, and seek compensatory and punitive damages. In February 2025, the federal cases were transferred for coordinated pre-trial proceedings to an MDL in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Florida.
A3. Legal Proceedings––Commercial and Other Matters
Monsanto-Related Matters
In 1997, Monsanto Company (Former Monsanto) contributed certain chemical manufacturing operations and facilities to a newly formed corporation, Solutia Inc. (Solutia), and spun off the shares of Solutia. In 2000, Former Monsanto merged with Pharmacia & Upjohn Company to form Pharmacia. Pharmacia then transferred its agricultural operations to a newly created subsidiary, named Monsanto Company (New Monsanto), which it spun off in a two-stage process that was completed in 2002. Pharmacia was acquired by Pfizer in 2003 and is a wholly owned subsidiary of Pfizer.
In connection with its spin-off that was completed in 2002, New Monsanto assumed, and agreed to indemnify Pharmacia for, any liabilities related to Pharmacia’s former agricultural business. New Monsanto has defended and/or is defending Pharmacia in connection with various claims and litigation arising out of, or related to, the agricultural business, and has been indemnifying Pharmacia when liability has been imposed or settlement has been reached regarding such claims and litigation.
In connection with its spin-off in 1997, Solutia assumed, and agreed to indemnify Pharmacia for, liabilities related to Former Monsanto’s chemical businesses. As the result of its reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, Solutia’s indemnification obligations relating to Former Monsanto’s chemical businesses are primarily limited to sites that Solutia has owned or operated. In addition, in connection with its spin-off that was completed in 2002, New Monsanto assumed, and agreed to indemnify Pharmacia for, any liabilities primarily related to Former Monsanto’s chemical businesses, including, but not limited to, any such liabilities that Solutia assumed. Solutia’s and New Monsanto’s assumption of, and agreement to indemnify Pharmacia for, these liabilities apply to pending actions and any future actions related to Former Monsanto’s chemical businesses in which Pharmacia is named as a defendant, including, without limitation, actions asserting environmental claims, including alleged exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls. Solutia and/or New Monsanto are defending Pharmacia in connection with various claims and litigation arising out of, or related to, Former Monsanto’s chemical businesses, and have been indemnifying Pharmacia when liability has been imposed or settlement has been reached regarding such claims and litigation. In 2018, Bayer AG acquired Monsanto Company (New Monsanto), which is now a subsidiary of Bayer AG. Since the acquisition, New Monsanto has continued to defend and indemnify Pharmacia for these liabilities.
Environmental Matters
In 2009, as part of our acquisition of Wyeth, we assumed responsibility for environmental remediation at the Wyeth Holdings LLC (formerly known as Wyeth Holdings Corporation and American Cyanamid Company) discontinued industrial chemical facility in Bound Brook, New Jersey. Since that time, we have executed or have become a party to a number of administrative settlement agreements, orders on consent, and/or judicial consent decrees, with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection and/or federal and state natural resource trustees to perform remedial design, removal and remedial actions, and related environmental remediation activities, and to resolve alleged damages to natural resources, at the Bound Brook facility. We have accrued for the currently estimated costs of these activities.
We are also party to a number of other proceedings brought under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, as amended, and other state, local or foreign laws in which the primary relief sought is the cost of past and/or future remediation.
Contracts with Iraqi Ministry of Health
In 2017, a number of U.S. service members, civilians, and their families brought a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia against a number of pharmaceutical and medical devices companies, including Pfizer and certain of its subsidiaries, alleging that the defendants violated the U.S. Anti-Terrorism Act. The complaint alleges that the defendants provided funding for terrorist organizations through their sales practices pursuant to pharmaceutical and medical device contracts with the Iraqi Ministry of Health and seeks monetary relief. In July 2020, the District Court granted defendants’ motions to dismiss and dismissed all of plaintiffs’ claims. In January 2022, the Court of Appeals reversed the District Court’s decision. In June 2024, the U.S. Supreme Court issued an order granting certiorari, vacating the Court of Appeals’ decision, and remanding the case to the Court of Appeals.

Allergan Complaint for Indemnity
In 2019, Pfizer was named as a defendant in a complaint, along with King, filed by Allergan Finance LLC (Allergan) in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, asserting claims for indemnity related to Kadian, which was owned for a short period by King in 2008, prior to Pfizer’s acquisition of King in 2010. This suit was voluntarily discontinued without prejudice in January 2021.
Breach of Contract – Comirnaty
In 2023, Pfizer and BioNTech Manufacturing GmbH initiated separate formal proceedings against the Republic of Poland, the Republic of Romania and Hungary in Belgium’s Court of First Instance of Brussels. Pfizer and BioNTech are seeking an order from the Court holding those countries to their commitments for COVID-19 vaccine orders, which were placed as part of their contracts signed in 2021.
A4. Legal Proceedings––Government Investigations
Like other multi-national pharmaceutical companies, we are subject to extensive regulation by government agencies in the U.S., other developed markets and multiple emerging markets in which we operate. Criminal charges, substantial fines and/or civil penalties, limitations on our ability to conduct business in applicable jurisdictions, corporate integrity or deferred prosecution agreements, as well as reputational harm and increased public interest in the matter could result from government investigations in the U.S. and other jurisdictions in which we do business. These matters often involve government requests for information on a voluntary basis or through subpoenas after which the government may seek additional information through follow-up requests or additional subpoenas. In addition, in a
qui tam
lawsuit in which the government declines to intervene, the relator may still pursue a suit for the recovery of civil damages and penalties on behalf of the government. Among the investigations by government agencies are the matters discussed below.
Greenstone Antitrust Litigation
In 2019 and 2020, Attorneys General of more than 50 states and territories filed
two
complaints in the U.S. District Court for the District of Connecticut against a number of pharmaceutical companies, including Pfizer and Greenstone—a former Pfizer subsidiary that sold generic drugs. As to Greenstone and Pfizer, the complaints allege anticompetitive conduct in violation of federal and state antitrust laws and state consumer protection laws. The State Attorney General complaints were initially transferred to an MDL in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania for coordinated pre-trial proceedings but were transferred back to the District of Connecticut in April 2024. The Greenstone antitrust litigation also includes civil complaints filed in federal and state court by private and governmental plaintiffs against Pfizer, Greenstone, and a number of other defendants. These related civil lawsuits assert allegations that generally overlap with those asserted by the State Attorneys General. All of the related federal lawsuits are part of the MDL pending in Pennsylvania.
Subpoena relating to Tris Pharma/Quillivant XR
In October 2018, we received a subpoena from the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York (SDNY) seeking records relating to our relationship with another drug manufacturer and its production and manufacturing of drugs including, but not limited to, Quillivant XR.
We have produced records in response to this request
.
Government Inquiries relating to Meridian Medical Technologies
In February 2019, we received a Civil Investigative Demand (CID) from the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the SDNY. The CID seeks records and information related to alleged quality issues involving the manufacture of auto-injectors at Pfizer’s former Meridian site. In August 2019, we received a HIPAA subpoena issued by the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Missouri, in coordination with the Department of Justice’s Consumer Protection Branch, seeking similar records and information. We have produced records in response to these and subsequent requests.
U.S. Department of Justice Inquiries relating to India Operations
In March 2020, we received an informal request from the U.S. Department of Justice’s Consumer Protection Branch seeking documents relating to our manufacturing operations in India, including at our former facility located at Irrungattukottai in India. In April 2020, we received a similar request from the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the SDNY regarding a civil investigation concerning operations at our facilities in India. We have produced records pursuant to these requests.

In April 2023, we received a HIPAA subpoena issued by the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Western District of Virginia, in coordination with the Department of Justice’s Commercial Litigation Branch, seeking records and information related to programs Pfizer sponsored in retail pharmacies relating to Xeljanz. We have produced records pursuant to this request.
B. Guarantees and Indemnifications
In the ordinary course of business and in connection with the sale of assets and businesses and other transactions, we often indemnify our counterparties against certain liabilities that may arise in connection with the transaction or that are related to events and activities prior to or following a transaction. If the indemnified party were to make a successful claim pursuant to the terms of the indemnification, we may be required to reimburse the loss. These indemnifications are generally subject to various restrictions and limitations. Historically, we have not paid significant amounts under these provisions and, as of March 30, 2025, the estimated fair value of these indemnification obligations is not material to Pfizer.
In addition, in connection with our entry into certain agreements and other transactions, our counterparties may be obligated to indemnify us. For example, our global agreement with BioNTech to co-develop a mRNA-based coronavirus vaccine program aimed at preventing COVID-19 infection includes certain indemnity provisions pursuant to which each of BioNTech and Pfizer has agreed to indemnify the other for certain liabilities that may arise in connection with certain third-party claims relating to Comirnaty.

Segment, Geographic and Other Revenue Information
A. Segment Information
We manage our commercial operations through
three
operating segments, each led by a single manager: Biopharma, PC1 and Pfizer Ignite. Biopharma is engaged in the discovery, development, manufacture, marketing, sale and distribution of biopharmaceutical products worldwide. PC1 is our contract development and manufacturing organization and a leading supplier of specialty active pharmaceutical ingredients. Pfizer Ignite is an offering that provides strategic guidance and end-to-end R&D services to select innovative biotech companies that align with Pfizer’s R&D focus areas. Biopharma is the only reportable segment. We regularly review our operating segments and the approach used by management to evaluate performance and allocate resources.
Our commercial divisions market, sell and distribute our products, and global operating functions are responsible for the research, development, manufacturing and supply of our products. Each operating segment is supported by our global corporate enabling functions. At the beginning of 2025, we made the following changes within our Biopharma reportable segment that went into effect on January 1, 2025 to support our continued focus on commercial execution and to further strengthen Pfizer’s capabilities and leadership in discovering and developing breakthrough medicines and vaccines:
•
transitioned all activities within the former Pfizer Oncology Division to other parts of Biopharma. Specifically, within our Biopharma reportable segment the U.S. Oncology commercial organization and the global Oncology marketing organization, which were part of the former Pfizer Oncology Division, are now part of the Pfizer U.S. Commercial Division. As of January 1, 2025, the commercial structure within our Biopharma reportable segment is now comprised of the Pfizer U.S. Commercial Division, which now focuses on the commercialization of Pfizer’s entire product portfolio in the U.S. and is led by the Chief U.S. Commercial Officer, Executive Vice President and the Pfizer International Commercial Division, which focuses on the commercialization of Pfizer’s entire product portfolio in all international markets and is led by the Chief International Commercial Officer, Executive Vice President.
•
strategically combined our former global Oncology Research and Development (ORD) and Pfizer Research and Development (PRD) divisions to form a single Pfizer R&D organization led by the Chief Scientific Officer and President, Research and Development. This organization is responsible for overseeing all R&D activities with end-to-end responsibilities that span from discovery to late-phase clinical development, including facilitating regulatory submissions, engaging with health authorities and global medical strategies. The R&D organization also includes science-based disciplines, providing comprehensive technical expertise for the development of Pfizer's medicines and vaccines. A newly formed Chief Medical

Other Business Activities and Reconciling Items––
Other business activities include the operating results of PC1 and Pfizer Ignite as well as certain pre-tax costs not allocated to our operating segment results, such as costs associated with corporate enabling functions and other corporate costs, as well as for the three months ended March 31, 2024, our share of earnings from Haleon.
In 2025, Pfizer made the decision to discontinue Pfizer Ignite and will begin winding down this business while collaborating closely with our Ignite partners to ensure continuity and the successful transition of work.
Reconciling items include the following items, transactions and events that are not allocated to our operating segments: (i) all amortization of intangible assets; (ii) acquisition-related items; and (iii) certain significant items, representing substantive and/or unusual, and in some cases recurring, items that are evaluated on an individual basis by management and that, either as a result of their nature or size, would not be expected to occur as part of our normal business on a regular basis.
Segment Assets––
We manage our assets on a total company basis, not by operating segment, as our operating assets are shared or commingled. Therefore, our CODM does not regularly review any asset information by operating segment and, accordingly, we do not report asset information by operating segment. Total assets were $
208

Remaining Performance Obligations––
Contracted revenue expected to be recognized from remaining performance obligations for firm orders in long-term contracts to supply Comirnaty and Paxlovid to our customers totaled approximately $
3
billion and $
1
billion, respectively, as of March 30, 2025, which includes amounts received in advance and deferred, as well as amounts that will be invoiced as we deliver these products to our customers in future periods. Of these amounts, current contract terms provide for expected delivery of product with contracted revenue from 2025 through 2028, the timing of which may be renegotiated. Remaining performance obligations are based on foreign exchange rates as of the end of our fiscal first quarter of 2025 and exclude arrangements with an original expected contract duration of less than one year. Remaining performance obligations associated with contracts for other products and services were not significant as of March 30, 2025 or December 31, 2024.
Deferred Revenues––
Our deferred revenues primarily relate to advance payments received or receivable from various government or government sponsored customers for supply of Paxlovid and Comirnaty. The deferred revenues related to Paxlovid and Comirnaty totaled $

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS
GENERAL
The following MD&A is intended to assist the reader in understanding our financial condition and results of operations, including an evaluation of the amounts and certainty of cash flows from operations and from outside sources, and is provided as a supplement to and should be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes in
Item 1. Financial Statements
in this Form 10-Q.
References to operational variances pertain to period-over-period changes that exclude the impact of foreign exchange rates. Although foreign exchange rate changes are part of our business, they are not within our control and because they can mask positive or negative trends in the business, we believe presenting operational variances excluding these foreign exchange changes provides useful information to evaluate our results.

Restructuring Programs
Realigning Our Cost Base Program
•
In the fourth quarter of 2023, we announced that we launched a multi-year, enterprise-wide cost realignment program that aims to realign our costs with our longer-term revenue expectations.
•
In the second quarter of 2025, we announced additional anticipated productivity opportunities, designed to further reduce costs primarily in SI&A, driven in large part by enhanced digital enablement, including automation and AI, and simplification of business processes.
•
In connection with our efforts to simplify the structure and sharpen the focus of our R&D organization, in the first quarter of 2025 we expanded this program after having identified additional opportunities to drive improvements in productivity and operational efficiencies through enhanced digital enablement, including automation and AI, and simplification of business processes.
Manufacturing Optimization Program
––In the second quarter of 2024, we announced that we launched a multi-year, multi-phased program to reduce our costs of goods sold, which is expected to include operational efficiencies, network structure changes, and product portfolio enhancements.
See
Note 3
for the anticipated and actual costs of these programs. For a description of anticipated savings related to these programs, see the
Costs and Expenses––Restructuring Charges and Other Costs Associated with Acquisitions and Cost-Reduction/Productivity Initiatives

Our Business Development Initiatives
––We are committed to strategically capitalizing on growth opportunities, primarily by advancing our own product pipeline and maximizing the value of our existing products, but also through various business development activities. For a description of the more significant recent transactions through February 27, 2025, the filing date of our 2024 Form 10-K, see

Our First Quarter 2025 Performance
Total Revenues
––
Total revenues
decreased $1.2 billion, or 8%, in the first quarter of 2025 to $13.7 billion from $14.9 billion in the first quarter of 2024, reflecting an operational decrease of $908 million, or 6%, as well as an unfavorable impact of foreign exchange of $256 million, or 2%. The operational decrease was primarily driven by a decline in Paxlovid, partially offset by
33
growth from the Vyndaqel family, Comirnaty and several other products despite the unfavorable impact of higher manufacturer discounts resulting from the IRA Medicare Part D Redesign.
See the
Total Revenues by Geography
and
Total Revenues––Selected Product Discussion
sections for more information, including a discussion of key drivers of our revenue performance. Certain of our vaccines, including Comirnaty, are subject to seasonality of demand, with a greater portion of revenues anticipated in the fall and winter seasons, and Paxlovid revenues trend with infection rates.

Income from Continuing Operations Before Provision/(Benefit) for Taxes on Income
––The decrease in
Income from continuing operations before provision/(benefit) for taxes on income
of $636 million, to $2.8 billion in the first quarter of 2025, from $3.4 billion in the first quarter of 2024, was primarily due to lower revenues and an increase in
Restructuring charges and certain acquisition-related costs,
partially offset by a decreases in
Cost of sales
and
Selling, informational and administrative expenses.

section of the MD&A
of our 2024 Form 10-K.
Intellectual Property Rights and Collaboration/Licensing Rights
––The loss, expiration or invalidation of intellectual property rights, patent litigation settlements and judgments, and the expiration of co-promotion and licensing rights can have a material adverse effect on our revenues. Certain of our products have experienced patent-based expirations or loss of regulatory exclusivity in certain markets in the last few years, and we expect certain products to face increased generic competition over the next few years. While additional patent-based or regulatory exclusivity expiries will continue, we expect a moderate impact of reduced revenues due to patent expiries in 2025 and anticipate a more significant impact of reduced revenues from patent-based or regulatory exclusivity expiries in 2026 through 2030 as several of our in-line products experience these expirations. We continue to vigorously defend our patent rights against infringement, and we will continue to support efforts that strengthen worldwide recognition of patent rights while taking necessary steps to help ensure appropriate patient access.
For additional information on patent rights we consider most significant to our business as a whole, see the
Item 1. Business––Patents and Other Intellectual Property Rights
section of our 2024 Form 10-K. For a discussion of recent developments with respect to patent litigation involving certain of our products, see
Note 12A1
.
Regulatory Environment/Pricing and Access––Government and Other Payor Group Pressures
––Governments globally, as well as private third-party payors in the U.S., may use a variety of measures to control costs, including, among others, legislative or regulatory pricing reforms, drug formularies (including tiering and utilization management tools), cross country collaboration and procurement, price cuts, mandatory rebates, health technology assessments, forced localization as a condition of market access, “international reference pricing” (i.e., the practice of a country linking its regulated medicine prices to those of other countries), quality consistency evaluation processes and volume-based procurement. We anticipate that these and similar initiatives will continue to increase pricing and access pressures globally. In the U.S., we expect to see continued focus by the U.S. government on regulating drug pricing and access to medicine, including but not limited to, the potential for international reference pricing. The drug pricing provisions of the IRA are being implemented over the next several years. In August 2023, CMS published the first ten medicines subject to the Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Program, which requires manufacturers of select drugs to engage in a process with the federal government to set new Medicare prices which would go into effect in 2026. Eliquis was among the first ten medicines subject to the Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Program. In August 2024, the government released the new Medicare price for Eliquis, which, effective January 1, 2026, will be required to be offered to all Medicare beneficiaries and to covered entities participating in the 340B Program that dispense Eliquis to a Medicare beneficiary if that maximum fair price is lower than the discounted price such entities are offered under the 340B Program ceiling price calculation. The Eliquis Medicare price is factored into our long-term financial planning, in accordance with our standard financial reporting and forecasting protocols. On January 17, 2025, CMS announced the selection of another 15 drugs from Medicare Part D for the maximum fair price, with prices to be set and effective on January 1, 2027. Ibrance and Xtandi were included in the list of 15 drugs selected. Another 15 drugs from Medicare Part B or Medicare Part D will be selected by February 1, 2026, for the maximum price to be set and in effect by January 1, 2028. It is possible that more of our products could be selected in future years, which could, among other things, lead to lower revenues prior to expiry of intellectual property protections. We continue to evaluate the impact of the IRA on our business, operations and financial condition and results as the full effect of the IRA on our business and the pharmaceutical industry remains uncertain. The IRA also made significant changes to the Medicare Part D benefit design (IRA Medicare Part D Redesign), which will impact our revenues in 2025, including: an expected favorable impact from the $2,000 annual out-of-pocket cap and new Prescription Payment Plan,
34
more than offset by an expected unfavorable impact from the sunsetting of the Coverage Gap Discount Program and the addition of new manufacturer discounts in the initial and catastrophic coverage phases. We anticipate a net unfavorable impact to revenue in 2025 of approximately $1 billion, year-over-year, related to the Medicare Part D Redesign changes that take effect in 2025. We expect a higher impact in the beginning of 2025, moderating through the remainder of the year, when compared to 2024. We expect these changes will more acutely impact our higher-priced medicines as they are expected to reach catastrophic coverage earlier in the year. In addition, changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program or the 340B Program, including legal or legislative developments at the federal or state level with respect to the 340B Program, could have a material impact on our business.

.
Product Supply
––We periodically encounter supply delays, disruptions and shortages, including due to voluntary product recalls and natural or man-made disasters. In response to requests from various regulatory authorities, manufacturers across the pharmaceutical industry, including Pfizer, are evaluating their product portfolios for the potential presence or formation of nitrosamines and we are actively engaging with regulatory authorities on this topic. If nitrosamines are detected in products, this may lead to submission of comprehensive data packages to regulatory authorities to support discussions on the relevant intake limit for the product and potential impact on patient supply, and, in some instances, may lead to market action for such products. For example, in 2021, Pfizer recalled Chantix due to the presence of a nitrosamine, N-nitroso-varenicline, at or above acceptable intake limits communicated by various regulatory authorities. Following issuance of updated guidance on acceptable intake limits for N-nitroso-varenicline by regulatory authorities, Chantix has returned to market in certain international markets and may return to additional markets, including the U.S., in the future.
We have not seen a significant disruption of our supply chain in the first three months of 2025 and through the date of filing of this Form 10-Q, and all of our manufacturing sites globally have continued to operate at or near normal levels. We do not anticipate the availability of raw materials to have a significant impact on our operations in 2025, but are monitoring potential supply chain disruptions as a result of ongoing geopolitical and trade negotiations, which could, among other things, impact costs. We are continuing to monitor and implement mitigation strategies to reduce any potential risk or impact including active supplier management, qualification of additional suppliers and advanced purchasing to the extent possible. For information on risks related to product manufacturing, see the
Item 1A. Risk Factors––Product Manufacturing, Sales and Marketing Risks

The Global Economic Environment
section of the MD&A of our 2024 Form 10-K.
Global Trade Environment
––Issued or future executive orders or other new or changes in laws, regulations or policy regarding tariffs, could have a material adverse effect on our business, earnings, cash flows, liquidity and financial guidance. The actual impact of new tariffs on our business would be subject to a number of factors including, but not limited to, restrictions on trade, the effective date and duration of such tariffs, countries included in the scope of tariffs, changes to amounts of tariffs, and potential retaliatory tariffs or other retaliatory actions imposed by other countries. We are evaluating opportunities and developing plans which may help mitigate the potential impact of tariffs on our business and operations. See the
Item 1A. Risk Factors—Global Operations
section of our 2024 Form 10-K.
COVID-19
––In response to COVID-19, we developed Paxlovid and collaborated with BioNTech to jointly develop Comirnaty. As part of our strategy for COVID-19, we are continuing to make significant investments in breakthrough science. This includes continuing to evaluate Comirnaty and Paxlovid, including against new variants of concern, developing variant adapted vaccine candidates and developing potential combination respiratory vaccines and potential next generation vaccines and therapies. We are also evaluating Paxlovid for certain pediatric patients. See the
Product Developments
section within MD&A.
In 2025, for Comirnaty, we expect vaccination rates and market share in commercial markets and revenue phasing similar to 2024, primarily concentrated in the second-half of the year. We have assumed no material U.S. policy changes for our vaccines portfolio in 2025 for purposes of our financial guidance, but see the
Item 1A. Risk Factors—U.S. Healthcare Regulation
section of our 2024 Form 10-K for a description of risks and uncertainties that could impact revenue from our portfolio of vaccines.
In 2025, for Paxlovid, we expect most revenue to be generated through commercial channels. We also expect utilization for Paxlovid to follow infection rates and stable market share, and revenues may fluctuate based on the timing, duration and severity of COVID-19 cases.

Total Revenues by Geography
See the
Total Revenues––Selected Product Discussion
section within MD&A for additional analysis and
Note 13C
.
Product Revenue Deductions
––Our gross product revenues are subject to a variety of deductions, which generally are estimated and recorded in the same period that the revenues are recognized. These deductions represent estimates of the related obligations and, as such, knowledge and judgment are required when estimating the impact of these product revenue deductions on gross sales for a reporting period. Historically, adjustments to these estimates to reflect actual results or updated expectations, have not been material to our overall business and generally have been less than 1% of revenues. Product-specific rebates, however, can have a significant impact on year-over-year individual product revenue growth trends.
36
(a)
The increase in Medicare rebates in the first quarter of 2025 is primarily driven by the impact of higher manufacturer discounts as a result of IRA Medicare Part D Redesign. See the
Overview of Our Performance, Operating Environment, Strategy and Outlook
section within MD&A.
(b)
The 2024 amount included a $771 million favorable final adjustment to the estimated non-cash Paxlovid revenue reversal of $3.5 billion recorded in the fourth quarter of 2023.
Product revenue deductions are primarily a function of product sales volume, mix of products sold, contractual or legislative discounts and rebates.

Costs and Expenses
First Quarter of 2025 vs. First Quarter of 2024
Cost of Sales
Cost of sales
decreased $534 million in the first quarter of 2025, primarily due to:
•
a favorable revision of our estimate of accrued royalties; and
•
a $210 million favorable impact of foreign exchange,
partially offset by:
•
a $260 million unfavorable impact of changes in sales mix.
38
The decrease in
Cost of sales
as a percentage of revenues in the first quarter of 2025 was primarily due to all the factors discussed above, as well as the non-recurrence of the Paxlovid favorable final adjustment of $771 million recorded in the first quarter of 2024 to the estimated non-cash Paxlovid revenue reversal recorded in the fourth quarter of 2023.
Certain of our vaccines, including Comirnaty, are subject to seasonality of demand, with a greater portion of revenues and related cost of sales anticipated in the fall and winter seasons. See also the
Overview of Our Performance, Operating Environment, Strategy and Outlook
—The Global Economic Environment––COVID-19
section for information about our COVID-19 products.
Selling, Informational and Administrative Expenses
Selling, informational and administrative
expenses decreased $464 million in the first quarter of 2025, primarily reflecting ongoing productivity improvements as part of our cost realignment program that drove both a decrease of $185 million in marketing and promotional spend for various products and lower spending of $145 million in corporate enabling functions, as well as lower spending of $90 million on COVID-19 products.
Research and Development Expenses
Research and development expenses
decreased $290 million in the first quarter of 2025, primarily driven by a net decrease in spending of $260 million due to pipeline focus and optimization, as well as lower compensation-related expenses.
Restructuring Charges and Other Costs Associated with Acquisitions and Cost-Reduction/Productivity Initiatives
Realigning Our Cost Base Program
––
This program is expected to deliver total net cost savings of approximately $5.7 billion through 2027. The total net cost savings are composed of: (i) net cost savings of $4.5 billion expected to be achieved by the end of 2025, most of which was achieved by year-end 2024, and (ii) our recently announced additional anticipated net cost savings of $1.2 billion, primarily in SI&A, expected to be achieved by the end of 2027. In addition, we expect cost savings of approximately $500 million from our recently announced expansion of this program related to our R&D re-organization to be realized by the end of 2026, with the savings expected to be reinvested in R&D programs.
Manufacturing Optimization Program
––
We expect to begin to achieve initial savings from Phase 1 of this multi-phased program in the latter part of 2025 and continue to expect approximately $1.5 billion in net cost savings from this first phase by the end of 2027.
Certain qualifying costs for these programs in all periods since inception were recorded and reflected as Certain Significant Items and excluded from our non-GAAP measure of Adjusted Income. See the
Non-GAAP Financial Measure: Adjusted Income
section within MD&A.
For a description of our programs, as well as the anticipated and actual costs, see
Note 3
.
The program savings discussed above may be rounded and represent approximations. In addition to these programs, we continuously monitor our operations for cost reduction and/or productivity opportunities, especially in light of patent-based and regulatory exclusivity expiries as well as the expiration of collaborative arrangements for various products. Long-term improvement in gross margin will remain a key focus for the Company over the next few years.
Seagen acquisition
––
In connection with our acquisition of Seagen, we are focusing our efforts on achieving an appropriate cost structure for the combined company. We expect to generate approximately $1 billion of annual cost synergies, to be achieved by 2026. The one-time costs to generate these synergies are expected to be approximately $1.7 billion, incurred primarily from 2023 through 2025.
Other (Income)/Deductions—Net
The unfavorable period-over-period change of $273 million in the first quarter of 2025 was primarily driven by (i) net losses on equity securities in the first quarter of 2025 versus net gains on equity securities in the first quarter of 2024, (ii) the non-recurrence of a gain on the partial sale of our investment in Haleon in the first quarter of 2024 and (iii) higher intangible asset impairment charges, partially offset by (iv) lower net interest expense. See
Note 4

Changes in Tax Laws––
Many countries outside the U.S. have enacted legislation for global minimum taxation resulting from the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development’s (OECD) Base Erosion and Profit Shifting “Pillar 2” project. The EU has approved a directive requiring member states to incorporate the OECD provisions into their respective domestic laws, and countries outside the EU are also enacting the provisions into their domestic law. The provisions are generally effective for Pfizer since 2024, though significant details and guidance around the provisions are still pending. Income tax expense could be adversely affected as the legislation becomes effective in countries in which we do business, and such impact could be material to our results of operations. We continue to monitor pending OECD guidance and legislation enactment and implementation by individual countries.

In September 2024, Pfizer announced that it was voluntarily withdrawing all lots of Oxbryta (voxelotor) for the treatment of sickle cell disease in all markets where it is approved. Pfizer also discontinued all active voxelotor clinical trials and expanded access programs worldwide. Pfizer’s decision was based on the totality of clinical data that indicated at that time the overall benefit of Oxbryta no longer outweighed the risk in the approved sickle cell patient population. The data suggested an imbalance in vaso-occlusive crises and fatal events, which required further assessment. Pfizer has notified regulatory authorities about these findings and its decision to voluntarily withdraw Oxbryta from the market and discontinue distribution and clinical studies while further reviewing the available data and investigating the findings. In July 2024, the EMA initiated a referral procedure under Article 20 of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 for Oxbryta (voxelotor) to review the product’s benefits and risks. In October 2024, the EC suspended the Oxbryta marketing authorization while the EMA’s review of data is ongoing. In addition, the FDA has initiated an evaluation of newly identified safety signals. The FDA also has placed the Oxbryta (voxelotor) investigational new drug application on clinical hold following Pfizer’s market withdrawal. Pfizer is continuing to work with the EMA, FDA, and other regulators globally in relation to this matter.
In December 2024, the FDA issued a partial clinical hold for osivelotor, which prohibits Pfizer from enrolling new participants into osivelotor clinical studies at this time. Study participants currently enrolled can continue on the study drug. Communication with the FDA is ongoing.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE: ADJUSTED INCOME
Adjusted income is an alternative measure of performance used by management to evaluate our overall performance as a supplement to our GAAP Reported performance measures. As such, we believe that investors’ understanding of our performance is enhanced by disclosing this measure. We use Adjusted income, certain components of Adjusted income and Adjusted diluted EPS to present the results of our major operations––the discovery, development, manufacture, marketing, sale and distribution of biopharmaceutical products worldwide––prior to considering certain income statement elements as follows:
(a)
Most directly comparable GAAP measure.
(b)
The short-term incentive plans for substantially all non-sales-force employees worldwide are funded from a pool based on our performance, measured in significant part versus three budgeted metrics, one of which, beginning with the 2025 performance year, is Adjusted income (as defined for annual incentive compensation purposes) and accounts for 40% of the bonus pool funding tied to financial performance. Additionally, beginning with the 2025 performance year, the payout for performance share awards is determined in part by Adjusted diluted EPS, which is derived from Adjusted income. Any expenses for acquired IPR&D are included in our non-GAAP Adjusted results but we exclude certain of these expenses for our financial results for annual incentive compensation purposes. The bonus pool funding is largely based on financial performance, as measured by three metrics, modified by performance against certain of our non-financial pipeline metrics, and may be further modified by our Compensation Committee’s assessment of other factors.
Adjusted income and its components and Adjusted diluted EPS are non-GAAP financial measures that have no standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and, therefore, are limited in their usefulness to investors. Because of their non-standardized definitions, they may not be comparable to the calculation of similar measures of other companies and are presented to permit investors to more fully understand how management assesses performance. A limitation of these measures is that they provide a view of our operations without including all events during a period, and do not provide a comparable view of our performance to peers. These measures are not, and should not be viewed as, substitutes for their most directly comparable GAAP measures of
Net income attributable to Pfizer Inc. common shareholders
, components of
Net income attributable to Pfizer Inc. common shareholders
and
EPS attributable to Pfizer Inc. common shareholders—diluted
, respectively.
We also recognize that, as internal measures of performance, these measures have limitations, and we do not restrict our performance-management process solely to these measures. We also use other tools designed to achieve the highest levels of performance. For example, our R&D organization has productivity targets, upon which its effectiveness is measured. In addition, total shareholder return, both on an absolute basis and relative to a publicly traded pharmaceutical index, plays a significant role in determining payouts under certain of our incentive compensation plans.
Adjusted Income and Adjusted Diluted EPS
Amortization of Intangible Assets
—Adjusted income excludes all amortization of intangible assets.
Acquisition-Related Items
—Adjusted income excludes certain acquisition-related items, which are composed of transaction, integration, restructuring charges and additional depreciation costs for business combinations because these costs are unique to each transaction and represent costs that were incurred to restructure and integrate businesses as a result of an acquisition. We have made no adjustments for resulting synergies. Acquisition-related items may include purchase accounting impacts such as
43
the incremental charge to cost of sales from the sale of acquired inventory that was written up to fair value, depreciation related to the increase/decrease in fair value of acquired fixed assets, amortization related to the increase in fair value of acquired debt, and the fair value changes for contingent consideration.
Discontinued Operations
—Adjusted income excludes the results of discontinued operations, as well as any related gains or losses on the disposal of such operations. We believe that this presentation is meaningful to investors because, while we review our product portfolio for strategic fit with our operations, we do not build or run our business with the intent to discontinue parts of our business. Restatements due to discontinued operations do not impact compensation or change the Adjusted income measure for the compensation in respect of the restated periods, but are presented for consistency across all periods.
Certain Significant Items
—Adjusted income excludes certain significant items representing substantive and/or unusual items that are evaluated individually on a quantitative and qualitative basis. Certain significant items may be highly variable and difficult to predict. Furthermore, in some cases it is reasonably possible that they could reoccur in future periods. For example, although major non-acquisition-related cost-reduction programs are specific to an event or goal with a defined term, we may have subsequent programs based on reorganizations of the business, cost productivity or in response to generic or biosimilar entry or economic conditions. Legal charges to resolve litigation are also related to specific cases, which are facts and circumstances specific and, in some cases, may also be the result of litigation matters at acquired companies that were inestimable, not probable or unresolved at the date of acquisition, or legal matters related to divested products or businesses. Gains and losses on equity securities and pension and postretirement actuarial remeasurement gains and losses have a very high degree of inherent market volatility, which we do not control and cannot predict with any level of certainty, and we do not believe including these gains and losses assists investors in understanding our business or is reflective of our core operations and business. Unusual items represent items that are not part of our ongoing business; items that, either as a result of their nature or size, we would not expect to occur as part of our normal business on a regular basis; items that would be non-recurring; or items that relate to products we no longer sell. See the

ANALYSIS OF THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS
ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY, CAPITAL RESOURCES AND MARKET RISK
Our historically robust operating cash flows, which we expect to continue over time, is a key strength of our liquidity and capital resources and our primary funding source. We continue to believe that with our ongoing operating cash flows, together with our financial assets, access to capital markets, revolving credit agreement, and available lines of credit, we have and will maintain the ability to meet our liquidity needs to support ongoing operations, our capital allocation objectives, and our contractual and other obligations for the foreseeable future. For information about the sources and uses of our funds and capital resources, as well as our operating cash flows, see our

Credit Ratings
––The cost and availability of financing are influenced by credit ratings, and an increase or decrease in our credit rating could have a beneficial or adverse effect on financing. Our long-term debt is rated high-quality by both S&P and Moody’s.
These ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold securities and the ratings are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating organizations. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.
Debt Capacity––Lines of Credit
––As of the date of the filing of this Form 10-Q, we had access to a $7.0 billion committed U.S. revolving credit facility maturing in October 2029, which may be used for general corporate purposes including to support our global commercial paper borrowings. In addition to the U.S. revolving credit facility, our lenders have provided us an additional $274 million in lines of credit, of which $252 million expire within one year. Essentially all lines of credit were unused as of the date of the filing of this Form 10-Q.
Capital Allocation Framework
––Our capital allocation framework is designed to enhance long-term shareholder value and is based on three core pillars: maintaining and growing our dividend over time, reinvesting in the business and making share repurchases after de-levering our balance sheet. We have actively de-levered and as of March 30, 2025 are below our previously stated gross leverage target.
Dividends
––In April 2025, our BOD declared a dividend of $0.43 per share, payable on June 13, 2025, to shareholders of record at the close of business on May 9, 2025.
Common Stock Purchases
—As of March 30, 2025, our remaining share-purchase authorization was $3.3 billion, with no repurchases in the first three months of 2025. See
Note 12
in our 2024 Form 10-K for more information on our publicly announced share-purchase plans.
Haleon
— In the first quarter of 2025, we sold the remaining portion of our investment in Haleon for $6.3 billion. Pfizer intends to use the proceeds to support its capital allocation priorities.
