SUSTAINABILITY.
As a company whose technology base helps generate approximately 25% of the world’s electricity, our integration of
sustainability into our core business strategy and culture reflects our strategic imperative to electrify and decarbonize the world and to play
a crucial role in the energy transition. Our s
ustainability framework
is guided by our commitment to help the energy sector address the
energy trilemma of reliability, affordability, and sustainability.
To operationalize this commitment, we have built the sustainability governance framework of “the Control Room.” The Control Room is led
by our Chief Sustainability Officer, who supervises a cross-functional, global team, and chairs our Sustainability Council. Further, we have a
Safety and Sustainability Committee of the Board of Directors, which guides and oversees our sustainability goals, impacts, risks, and
efforts. Our operational efforts are aligned with our business strategy, the priorities of our stakeholders, our commitments, and our aim to
deliver innovative technologies to create a more sustainable electric power system.
The four pillars of our sustainability framework: Electrify, Decarbonize, Conserve, and Thrive:
•
Electrify: Catalyze access to more secure, sustainable, reliable, and affordable electricity, while helping to drive global
economic development.
We seek to add power generation and grid capacity to strengthen current electricity infrastructure and
provide critical redundancy, support electrification in underserved regions, and encourage economic development.
•
Decarbonize: Invent, deploy, and service technology to help decarbonize and electrify the world.
We seek to advance both
the near-term impact by improving the trajectory on carbon intensity and the long-term impact by deploying products that are
increasingly capable of lower carbon emissions once supporting infrastructure is deployed at scale.
•
Conserve: Innovate more while using less.
We are working to reduce both our direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions
and have set a goal to achieve carbon neutrality for our Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions by 2030. We also support the transition
to a more circular economy and recognize the importance of critical raw materials and nature in our mission. We are working to
track 90% of our top products as part of our circularity framework by 2030, including principles such as eco-design.
•
Thrive: Advance safe, responsible,

about these risks.
COMPETITION.
We believe GE Vernova's businesses' ability to supply the electric power industry with a broad array of advanced
technologies for an intelligent, sustainable power system that help customers accelerate the energy transition is a key differentiator among
various of our competitors. Due to increasing demand exceeding available capacity for products and services that supply the electrical
power industry, we face growing competition from emerging threats. The continuing ability to reduce cycle times and ensure available
capacity is expected to
allow us
to remain competitive as demand for our products and services grows significantly. In addition, continued
investment in our products and services and emerging technologies is necessary for us to successfully compete and deliver economic
value and performance to our customers through efficiency, reliability, and affordability.
Our businesses operate in highly competitive markets. We compete based on product performance, quality, branding, service and/or price
across the industries and geographies served. Various companies compete with us across single or multiple products and services.
Key Power segment competitors include Siemens Energy, Mitsubishi Power, Westinghouse, Framatome, and Rolls-Royce.
Key Wind segment competitors include Vestas, Siemens-Gamesa, and Nordex.
Key Electrification segment competitors include Hitachi Energy, Siemens Energy, Siemens, Schneider Electric, Mitsubishi Electric, and
ABB.
SEGMENTS
.
We report three business segments that are aligned with the nature of equipment and services they provide, specifically
Power, Wind, and Electrification.
Power.
Our Power segment serves power generation, industrial, government, and other customers worldwide with products and services
related to energy production. Our products and technologies harness resources such as
natural gas, oil, diesel, water, and nuclea
r to
produce electric power and include gas and steam turbines,
full balance of plant,
upgrade, and service
solutions.
Gas Power -
offers a wide spectrum of heavy-duty and aeroderivative gas turbines for utilities, independent power producers, and
numerous industrial applications, ranging from small, mobile power to utility scale power plants. Gas Power also delivers maintenance and
service solutions across total plant assets and over their operational lifecycle.
Nu
clear Power
-
provides nuclear technology solutions for boiling water reactors including reactor design, reactor fuel and support services,
and the design and development of small modular reactors through joint ventures with
Hitachi, Ltd.
Hydro Power -
provides a portfolio of solutions and services for hydropower generation for both large hydropower plants and small
hydropower solutions.
Steam Power -
offers a comprehensive range of steam turbine technologies and services primarily for nuclear power plants in North
America and coal-fired power plants, helping our customers deliver reliable energy, and supporting coal-fired plant customers
transitioning
to a lower-carbon future
.
We believe that gas power plays an essential role in the energy transition, serving as a fundamental source of reliable and dispatchable
power. Despite evolving market factors related to the energy transition, such as increased renewable energy penetration and new climate
change-related legislation and policies, we anticipate the gas power
industry
will grow over the next decade. We expect gas power
generation to increase at low-single digit rates, playing a critical role supporting load growth, maintaining grid stability, and energy security.
During the year ended December 31, 2024, GE Vernova's gas turbine installed base utilization was flat compared to
the same period last
year
. Growth in Asia from fewer outages and more HA units commissioned and higher utilization in the United States (
U.S.)
were offset by
Europe where increased nuclear, hydro, and renewable energy drove lower gas operations in the year. Global electricity demand increased
by low-single digits.
As of December 31, 2024, our fundamentals remained strong with approximately $73.4 billion in r
emaining performance obligations
(RPO)
and a gas turbine installed base of approximately 7,000 units with approximately 1,700 units under long-term service agreements
and
an
average remaining contract life of approximately 10 years. As of December 31, 2024, we had 32 HA-Turbines in RPO, 30 being installed
and commissioned, and 115 HA-Turbines in our installed base with approximately 2.9 million operating hours.
We maintain a strong focus on our underwriting discipline and risk management to secure deals that meet our financial hurdles and ensure
we deliver confidently for our customers. Operating in emerging markets presents uncertainties in deal closures due to financing and other
complexities. Given the long-cycle nature of our business and the ongoing challenges from inflationary pressures, our Power segment has
proactively implemented lean initiatives to
sustain
cost productivity, collaborated closely with suppliers, and adjusted product and service
pricing in line with market demand, inflation, and industry dynamics.
We continue to invest in new product development. In Nuclear Power, we have an agreement
with a customer
for the deployment of small
modular nuclear reactor (SMR) technology, making it the first commercial contract of its kind in North America. SMRs have the potential to
reduce nuclear power plant costs and cycle times through their standardized and modularized design. In Gas Power, we are committed to
long-term investments to meet our
growing demand from our customers
by enhancing production capacity at existing factories to address
the increasing need for both equipment and services. We continue to invest in technologies and decarbonization pathways to deliver lower
carbon-emitting and more reliable power. In the fourth quarter, we secured an agreement in the United Kingdom for one of the world's first
commercial-scale gas-fired power stations with carbon capture, aiming to capture up to 2 million tons of CO
2
annually and contributing to
the United Kingdom's net-zero goals. We are committed to advancing decarbonization technologies that we believe will provide our
customers with options for more r
enewable
and more dependable energy.

Wind.
Our Wind segment includes our wind generation technologies, inclusive of onshore and offshore wind turbines and blades. In our
Wind segment,
we engineer, manufacture, and commercialize wind turbines,
an important technology playing a role in the energy transition
as we seek to decarbonize the
world's energy sector
.
Onshore Wind -
delivers wind turbines, technology, and services for the onshore wind power industry by focusing on work-horse products in
select geographies, while continuing to innovate the technology to create wind turbines suitable for various markets and environmental
conditions. Our workhorse products include our
2.8-127m, 3.6-154m, and 6.1-158m onshore units.
Wind services assist customers in
improving cost, capacity, and performance of their assets over the lifetime of their fleets, utilizing digital infrastructure to monitor,
predict,
and
optimize wind farm energy performance.
Offshore Wind
- provides offshore wind power technologies and wind farm development for the offshore wind power sector
.
Our workhorse
product in the offshore market is our Haliade-X 220m offshore
unit
.
LM Wind Power
- designs, produces, and tests wind
turbine blades.
As we focus on providing carbon-free electricity reliably and at scale, we have simplified our segment management structure and portfolio
of product offerings, focusing on fewer and more reliable workhorse products. Our w
orkhorse products account for approximately
70%
of
our equipment RPO at
December 31, 2024
. Included in our RPO are services agreements on approximately
23,000
of our onshore wind
turbines, from an installed base of approximately
57,000
units.
At Onshore Wind, we are focused on improving our overall fleet availability. We are reducing product variants and deploying repairs and
other corrective measures across the fleet. Concurrently, we intend to operate in fewer geographies and focus on those geographic regions
that a
lign better with our products and supply chain footprin
t, positioning our workhorse products to targeted countries. Our volume mix has
shifted towards the U.S., currently representing approximately 75% of Onshore Wind's equipment RPO, while our international volume has
become smaller and more profitable. Specifically in the U.S., the
IRA
introduced new, and extended existing, tax incentives, significantly
improving project economics for our customers and tu
rbine producers. Our projects in the U.S. generally benefit from incentives available to
our customers and broadly available IRA incentives
.
We will continue to monitor government actions for any changes that could adversely
impact the market for wind turbine manufacturers.
Finally
, we are continuing our restructuring
program
to reduce our operating costs and
are seeing the benefits both operationally and financially
.
At Offshore Wind
, we continue to experience pressure related to our product and project costs and execution timelines, as we deliver on
our existing backlog. We are committed to driving quality improvements, installation efficiencies, and cost productivity. Similar to Onshore
Wind,
we have embarked on a restructuring program to reduce our operating costs
.
Electrification.
Our Electrification segment includes grid solutions, power conversion, solar and storage solutions, which we collectively
refer to as Electrification Systems, and Electrification Software, that provide products and services required for the transmission,
distribution, conversion, storage, and orchestration of electricity from point of generation to point of consumption. Several of the key
offerings in this segment, for example, include our high-voltage direct current transmission (HVDC) products, power transformers,
switchgear, and our grid automation related products and services.
Grid Solutions
- enables power utilities and industries worldwide to effectively manage electricity from the point of generation to
consumption, helping the reliability,
efficiency, and
resiliency of the grid. Offerings include a comprehensive portfolio of equipment,
hardware, protection and control, automation, and digital services. Grid Solutions also addresses the challenges of the energy transition by
safely and reliably connecting intermittent renewable energy generation to transmission networks.
Power Conversion
- applies the science and systems of power conversion to provide motors, generators, automation, and control

energy generation sources.
Electrification Software
- supports the transmission, distribution, conversion, storage, and orchestration of electricity from point of
generation to point of consumption.
We continue to experience
robust demand
for our systems, equipment, and services. Demand remains strong for large scale transmission-
related equipment to interconnect renewables and move bulk power. We also continue to benefit from higher growth in orders from other
transmission activities within our Grid Solutions business.
Our Grid Solutions business is positioned to support grid expansion and modernization needs globally.
We participate in the onshore
interconnection sector and the rapidly growing
offshore interconnection sector
with new products and technology. We have developed and
seek to continue developing new technologies with the intention of solving for a denser, more resilient, stable, and efficient electric grid with
lower future greenhouse gas emissions.
We
adjust
pricing and contractual terms of our products and services based on demand, inflation, and industry dynamics. Customer lead-
times have increased as a result of demand outstripping supply, though we are proactively managing this by deploying lean initiatives to
reduce lead-times and drive cost productivity. In addition, we are making investments to expand our capacity and capabilities to support this
continued growth while benefiting from synergies across our Electrification businesses.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT.
GE Vernova’s R&D efforts focus on driving the energy transition. We are engineering the
technologies, forging the partnerships, and delivering innovations to electrify and decarbonize the world. We expect to invest approximately
$5 billion of cumulative R&D from 2025 through 2028 across our businesses. Approximately half of this R&D is focused on continuously
2024 FORM 10-K
7
industrializing existing products and supporting our installed base for this decade. The other half is focused on long-term innovation to
deliver our next generation of differentiated products.
R&D is performed within each of our businesses, and at multiple locations around the world, including at our research facilities in
Niskayuna, New York and Bangalore, India, which we refer to collectively as Advanced Research. Advanced Research partners with our
businesses on programs to create the technology breakthroughs that will feed our future product roadmaps. They are guided by our
customers’ demands for sustainable, affordable, resilient, and secure energy. Additionally, Advanced Research partners with other
established and start-up companies and educational institutions to incubate and commercialize new technology and launch new
businesses in markets that are key to the energy transition but go beyond GE Vernova’s core businesses.
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY.
We have a substantial portfolio of intellectual property (
IP)
assets, registered and unregistered, that
protect both our investments in R&D across our businesses as well as our products and services. To protect our innovation, we rely on a
variety of IP rights and data protection measures, as well as monitor the activities of third parties to ensure
that unauthorized use of IP does
not go unremedied
.
Patents are an important part of our IP strategy. They protect our inventions around the world. We shape and reposition our patent portfolio
to cover emerging and other technologies that drive our core businesses. Software, which is important to all of our businesses, but is
especially central to the IP position of the Electrification businesses, is protected by a combination of copyrights, patents, and contractual
protections.
We protect our trade secrets and confidential know-how by actively enforcing our internal policies for data classification and protection and
by requiring and enforcing specific innovation and proprietary information agreements and
non-disclosure agreements
. We also utilize
contemporary cybersecurity tools and systems, as well as physical security measures, that safeguard our most valuable data from insider
threats and third-party concentrated efforts to misappropriate our IP. See Item 1C. "Cybersecurity" for further information.
While our patents and other IP protections are important to our operations, we do not consider any single IP asset or group of assets to be
of material significance to any of our financial segments or our businesses as a whole. However, we believe that we derive a sustained
competitive advantage both from our IP portfolio as well as technical know-how embedded in our products and manufacturing techniques
developed over decades. We further believe that our understanding of our customers’ needs, technology expertise, and manufacturing
know-how are critical to our business.
In addition to our IP portfolio, we have a license to use certain IP from GE Aerospace, including the GE name and the GE Monogram. The
license applies to our products and services, as well as to natural extensions and evolutions thereof.
See “Certain Relationships and
Related Person Transactions—Agreements with GE—Agreements Governing Intellectual Property” in our information statement dated
March 8, 2024, which was attached as Exhibit 99.1 to a Current Report on Form 8-K furnished with the SEC on March 8, 2024 (the
Information Statement).
GLOBAL SUPPLY CHAIN.
Annually, we purchase approximately $20 billion in materials and components sourced from over 100
countries.
We face various supply chain challenges, many of which are industry-wide or arise from geopolitical and economic conditions
beyond our control. These include global conflicts, global economic trends, geopolitical dynamics like sanctions,
tariffs and
other trade
tensions, inflation, logistics issues, human rights landscape shifts, and regulatory changes. Additionally, potential disruptions such as
natural disasters and other extreme
weather conditions, global
pandemics, and cyber-attacks could significantly impact our operations,
financial performance, and ability to meet customer commitments.
To address these challenges, we maintain strong supplier relationships and prioritize opportunities to localize our supply chain to serve our
distinct geographies, while at the same time allowing us to maintain a globally diverse supply chain for operational resiliency. Our risk-
based supplier onboarding process involves thorough due diligence, focusing on performance, labor standards, ethical sourcing, and
human rights, supported by an audit program.
We are expanding these efforts to consider environmental impact and environmental, social
and governance (
ESG)
regulations, along with alignment to our GE Vernova sustainability framework.
Internally, we manage risks through cyber mitigation, business continuity planning, and crisis management. We have developed cross-
business councils for supply chain and procurement to proactively share best practices around supply chain resiliency. We are also
enhancing our risk management tools to leverage technology for better market trend analysis and risk mitigation concerning commodity
pricing, availability, lead-times, country specific tariff
impacts, and
ESG compliance. Specifically, to minimize inflationary impacts, we have a
sourcing process to monitor commodity price fluctuations across the ferrous, non-ferrous, precious metals, and energy commodities. We
continue to employ and evolve lean practices across our operations to enhance safety, quality, and delivery performance, building new
capabilities to scale our supply chain aligned to our business growth.

proximately 24,000 employees in Europe, 19,000 employees in the U.S., 18,000 employees in Asia, and
7,000 employees in Latin America. GE Vernova’s relationship with employee-representative organizations around the world takes many
forms.
•
Within the U.S., we have approximately 1,300 union-represented production and maintenance employees who are covered by a
four-year collective bargaining agreement that was ratified for a two-year extension in 2023 and expires in June of 2025.
•
In Europe, we engage with approximately 100 representative organizations such as works councils and trade unions, in
accordance with local law. Social dialogue, including information, consultation, and negotiation, is a key component of doing
business in Europe and a driver of sustainable business growth for us in the region.
•
In addition to the U.S. and Europe, we also engage with employee representative bodies in China (2,200 employees), India (2,000
employees), Canada (700 employees), Brazil (600 employees), and Mexico (150 employees).
We strive to build and maintain productive relationships with all trade unions and employee-representative organizations with which we
engage. More broadly, our relationship
with every employee
, regardless of functional discipline, geography or representation status, is a
priority. The purpose, passion, and expertise our employees embody every day is fundamental to providing essential electricity around the
world and for the future of our environment. It is our mission to inspire, engage, and develop our employees to their fullest potential.
ENVIRONMENTAL, HEALTH, AND SAFETY MATTERS.
GE Vernova is committed to providing and promoting a safe and healthy
working environmen
t, using natural resources and energy in a sustainable way,
and avoiding an adverse impact to employees and
contractors, our customers, the
environment, and
the communities where we do business. We support our customers by maintaining the
highest standards in safeguarding our employees, our contracting partners, and the environment.
In addition to our own internal e
nterprise standards and core requirements
on various
EHS
topics, we are subject to international, national,
state, and local EHS laws, regulations, and industry and customer standards, including EHS licensing and authorization requirements.
These EHS laws apply to a broad range of activities across our whole product lifecycle and our entire global organization, including those
related to:
•
protection of the environment and use of natural resources;
•
occupational health and safety;
•
the use, management, release, storage, transportation, r
emediation, and
disposal of, and exposure to, hazardous substances and
waste;
•
our products, including the use of certain chemicals in our products and production processes;
•
emissions to air and water; and
•
climate change and greenhouse gas emissions.
EHS laws vary by jurisdiction and have become increasingly stringent over time. These requirements impose certain responsibilities on our
business, including the obligation to install pollution control technologies and obtain and maintain various environmental permits, the cost of
which may be substantial. Satisfying such local EHS requirements is often a minimum requirement for us, and we commit extensive
resources to maintaining our compliance with these requirements. For example, by applying our enterprise standards and core
requirements everywhere (except where local regulations are more stringent), we often go beyond local compliance requirements,
especially where local standards are weak or lacking. Safety is incorporated into our
lean
operating method and we prioritize safeguarding
our employees and contractors. We also enhance our internal enterprise standards and core requirements regularly through a culture of
continuous improvement and documenting opportunities to improve through internal and external audits.
Our EHS management system includes measures to verify that we are monitoring adherence to GE Vernova EHS standards and regulatory
requirements through audits and inspections. Operations are assessed on a regular basis as part of our management of change
(MOC)
process to mitigate safety risks. EHS operational reviews at both the business and GE Vernova level address progress on program
execution as well as strategy discussions related to emerging EHS risks.

Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we presently deem less significant may also adversely affect our
business.
Risks Relating to Our Business and Our Industry
Risks Relating to Operations and Supply Chain
We provide complex and specialized products, solutions, and services, and we could be adversely affected by actual or
perceived quality issues or safety failures.
We produce highly sophisticated and leading-edge products and provide specialized
solutions and services for complex technology and engineered products and projects, including both products and software. Many of our
products, solutions, and services involve complex industrial machinery or infrastructure projects, such as gas turbines, onshore and
offshore wind turbines, grid infrastructure, or nuclear power generation. A serious product or execution failure could result in a range of
adverse outcomes, including injuries or death, widespread power outages, suspension of power production, installation or fleet delivery
delays, environmental impacts, or similar systemic issues and could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial
position, cash flows, and results of operations. Actual or perceived design, production, performance, or other quality issues related to new
product introductions or existing product lines have resulted and can result in direct warranty, maintenance, and other claims for damages,
including costs associated with project delays, repairs, or replacements, some of which have been and can in the future be for significant
amounts. For example, during the summer of 2024, a wind turbine blade event occurred, related to a manufacturing deviation, at the
Vineyard Wind offshore wind farm where we are the manufacturer and supplier of our newly developed Haliade-X 220m wind turbines
(Halia
de-X). See Item 7. "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Offshore Wind" for
additional information.
Quality issues can also result in reputational harm to our business with a potential loss of attractiveness of our
products, solutions, and services to new and existing customers. A widespread fleet issue could result in revenue loss while the associated
product is suspended from operation. This risk is pronounced in connection with the introduction of new technology. For example, due to
the difficulties associated with scaling up production of new products and components, the challenges of servicing our substantial installed
fleet of onshore wind turbines and the difficulties of servicing our offshore wind turbines, a widespread fleet product quality issue with our
wind turbines could cause us to incur substantial costs and could take significant time to address. Additionally, many of our products,
solutions, and services function under demanding operating conditions and meet exacting certification, performance, and reliability
standards that we, our customers, or regulators adopt. Developing and maintaining products, solutions, and services that meet or exceed
these standards can be costly and technologically challenging and require extensive coordination of our suppliers and team members at
our technology, manufacturing, and remote project sites in both developed and developing markets around the world. Failures to deliver
products, solutions, and services that meet these standards, whether actual or perceived, have resulted and may in the future result in
customers or other third parties asserting contractual or other claims, often for significant amounts, or regulators suspending installation or
operations, which could have significant adverse financial, competitive, or reputational effects.
Our products contain and are integrated with products from third parties. From time to time, the processes used to ensure the quality of
those third-party products may fail to detect defects. Despite the operational processes around product design, manufacture, performance,
and servicing that we and our customers or other third parties have developed to meet rigorous quality standards, the risk of operational
process or product failures and other problems cannot be eliminated. Such problems could result in increased costs, delayed payments,
lost products or services revenue, and product, safety, quality, regulatory, or environmental risks, which could have an adverse effect on our
financial results.
If our ongoing efforts to achieve our anticipated operational cost savings and implement initiatives to control or reduce our
operating costs are not successful, our financial results and cash flows may be adversely affected.
Achieving our long-term
financial results and cash flow goals depends significantly on our ability to control and/ or reduce our operating costs. Generally, because
many of our costs are affected by factors completely, or substantially outside our control, we must seek to control or reduce costs through
productivity initiatives. We seek continued cost savings through lean operations and supply chain management. While controlling our cost
base is important for our business and future competitiveness, there is no guarantee that we will achieve this goal. Additionally, cost
savings anticipated by us are based on estimates and assumptions that are inherently uncertain and may be subject to significant business,
economic and competitive uncertainties, and contingencies, all of which are difficult to predict and may be beyond our control. For example,
the rapid pace of innovation among onshore and offshore wind turbine manufacturers in recent years has led to short product cycles, early
market introductions, and faster time to market, all of which have and can lead to quality and execution issues, higher costs, or other
2024 FORM 10-K
12
challenges to achieving profitability for new products. Such risks are especially acute in the offshore wind industry, which is a nascent
industry, with higher ramp up costs and the potential for new product introductions to result in losses both in the short-and in the long-run.
See Item 7. "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Offshore Wind" for a description
of recent quality and execution issues we have experienced at our Offshore Wind projects. If we are not able to identify and implement
initiatives that control and/or reduce costs and increase operating efficiency, or if the cost savings initiatives we have implemented to date
do not generate expected cost savings, our financial results could be adversely affected.
We enter into long-term service agreements in connection with significant contracts for the sale of products, particularly in our Gas Power
business unit. In connection with these agreements, we estimate our products’ durability and reliability, as well as our costs associated with
delivering the products and the provision of services over time in order to be profitable and generate acceptable returns on our investments.
Particularly for our long-cycle businesses and contracts like these, a failure to appropriately estimate, plan for, or execute our business
plans may adversely affect our delivery of products, services, and outcomes in line with our projected financial performance or cost
estimates, and ultimately may result in excess costs, build-up of inventory that becomes obsolete, lower profit margins and cash flows, and
an erosion of our competitive position.
Significant disruptions in our supply chain, including the high cost or unavailability of raw materials, components, and products
essential to our business, and significant disruptions to our manufacturing and production facilities and distribution networks
could adversely affect our future financial results, and our ability to execute our operations on a timely basis.
Our reliance on third-
party suppliers, contract manufacturers and service providers, and commodity markets to secure raw materials, parts, components, and
sub-systems used in our products exposes us to volatility in the prices and availability of these materials, parts, components, systems, and
services. As our supply chains extend into many different countries and regions of the world, including many developing economies, we are
also subject to global economic and geopolitical dynamics, including tariffs, and risks associated with exporting or importing components
and raw materials for completing the construction or incorporation process in other countries.
We operate in a supply-constrained environment and have faced, are facing, and may in the future face, supply-chain shortages,
inflationary pressures, shortages of skilled labor, transportation and logistics challenges and manufacturing disruptions that impact our
revenues, profitability, cash flow, and timeliness in fulfilling customer orders. To manage the impact of supply chain shortages and
inflationary pressures, we have sought, and may continue to seek, to negotiate long-term agreements with suppliers, develop relationships
with alternative suppliers, drive productivity initiatives in our manufacturing operations, provide training to our employees, develop alternate
transportation routes, modes, and providers, and share rising costs with our customers. While these measures have successfully mitigated
against historical impact, we expect supply chain pressures across our businesses will continue to challenge and adversely affect our
operations and financial performance for some period of time. In addition, some of our suppliers or their sub-suppliers are limited-or sole-
source suppliers, and our ability to meet our obligations to customers depends on the performance, product quality, and stability of such
suppliers. Generally, raw materials and components are available from a number of different suppliers, although we rely on a single
supplier, a small number of suppliers, or suppliers located in a single country for certain materials and components, including for example
some semiconductor chips, cobalt, certain steel, hafnium, and other rare earth metals. We have in the past experienced, and in the future
may experience, disruptions related to availability of components and materials sourced from single suppliers, but the impact to our
operations and financial results of such disruptions have not been material. However, if one of these suppliers were unable to provide us
with a raw material or component we need, our ability to manufacture some of our products or provide some of our services could be
adversely affected if and to the extent that we are unable to find a sufficient alternative supply channel in a reasonable period of time or on
commercially reasonable terms in light of the circumstances.
Disruptions in deliveries, capacity constraints, production disruptions up-or down-stream, price increases, cyber- related attacks, or
decreased availability of raw materials or commodities, including as a result of war, natural disasters, actual or threatened public health
emergencies, increased tariffs or import or export restrictions, or other business continuity events, adversely affect our operations and,
depending on the length and severity of the disruption, could limit our ability to manufacture products on a timely basis and could harm our
financial results. Additionally, nonperformance or underperformance by third-party suppliers could materially impact our ability to perform
obligations to our customers, which could result in a customer terminating their contract with us, exposing us to liability, and substantially
impairing our ability to compete for future contracts and orders.
Furthermore, we depend on multiple routes and modes of transport to acquire components and materials used in our operations. We are
vulnerable to disruptions in transport and logistics activities due to weather-related problems, strikes, lockouts, inadequacy of roadways,
transportation infrastructure and port facilities, hostilities, acts of terrorism, or other events. We are also subject to fluctuations in the costs
of transportation. We may be unable to store components and materials sufficient for more than a limited period of production, which
increases our dependence on efficient logistics. In addition, during transport and shipping, our products and/or their components and
materials may become damaged. Such factors could also result in liability and significant reputational harm. These factors could adversely
impact our ability to deliver quality products, solutions, and services to our customers and may have a substantial adverse impact on our
business activities, results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition.
Any interruption in the operations of our manufacturing facilities may impair our ability to deliver or provide products, solutions,
and services.
We are dependent on our global production and operating network to develop, manufacture, assemble, supply, and service
our offerings. A work stoppage, labor shortage, or other production limitation, including i
mport or export restrictions
, or transportation
issues, among others, could adversely affect our manufacturing facilities and negatively impact our reputation and market position. In
addition, manufacturing disruptions related to significant public health and safety events, severe weather, financial distress, unscheduled
downtimes, manufacturing deviations, quality issues, production constraints, mechanical failures, cybersecurity attacks, and geopolitical
dynamics and risks could interrupt our ability to deliver or provide certain products, solutions, and services. Such risks may be heightened
in emerging market countries, which may be subject to varying degrees of economic, political, and social instability.
We also have internal dependencies on certain key manufacturing or other facilities. For example, our Onshore and Offshore Wind
businesses are, and may in the future be, reliant on our internal ability to manufacture blades for wind turbines through our LM Wind Power
business, which accounts for a substantial percentage of our wind blade production. Similarly, we internally manufacture certain specialized
transformers for our Grid Solutions business. If we are unable to produce or assemble these components internally in sufficient quantities,
2024 FORM 10-K
13
due to disturbances at a certain production location or for any other reason, we may be forced to increase the volume of wind turbine
blades or transformers purchased from external suppliers which could lead to delays, quality control issues, or additional costs.
Any significant event affecting one of our production or operating facilities may result in a disruption to our ability to supply customers. The
impact of these risks is heightened if our production capacity is at or near full utilization (or if we lack alternative manufacturing sites) and
could result in our inability to accept orders or deliver products in a timely manner. Additionally, significant capital investment to increase
manufacturing capacity may be required to expand our business or meet increased demand for existing or newly introduced products in the
future. Any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business results, cash flows, financial condition, or prospects.
Our failure to manage customer relationships and customer contracts could adversely affect our financial results.
An important
element of our success is our ability to manage customer relationships, while delivering against our contractual requirements and
anticipating changes in customer requirements and circumstances. Existing or potential customers may delay or cancel plans to purchase
our products, solutions, and services, including large infrastructure projects, and may not be able to fulfill their obligations to us in a timely
fashion or at all as a result of business deterioration, cash flow shortages, shifts in the availability of financing for certain types of projects or
technologies (such as prohibitions on financing for fossil fuel-based projects or technologies), macroeconomic conditions, changes in law,
disputes, or other delays. If a large customer was to experience difficulties in fulfilling its obligations to us, cease doing business with us,
significantly reduce the amount of its purchases from us, favor competitors or new entrants, change its purchasing patterns, or impose
unexpected fees on us, our business may be harmed. In addition, many of our customer contracts are complex and contain warranty and
other provisions that could cause us to incur significant repair or replacement costs, penalties, liquidated or other damages, and/or
unanticipated expenses with respect to the timely delivery, functionality, quality, deployment, operation, and availability of our products,
solutions, and services. For example, we face risks in our Wind business related to our ability to assemble and deliver specific components
such as nacelles on the timelines and schedules detailed and otherwise comply with our customer contracts. Failure to adhere to
requirements under our customer agreements, whether such failure is actual or alleged, has resulted in and could in the future result in
higher potential costs, present litigation risks, or expose us to liquidated or other damages.
Our customers include numerous governmental owned or affiliated entities within and outside the U.S., including the U.S. federal
government and state and local entities. Some of those contracts could be subject to the risk of delay, modification, or termination if future
government funding or support is not available. We also at times face greater challenges with the timely collection of receivables with
customers that are sovereign governments, government owned entities, or customers located in emerging markets.
Our ability to maintain our investment grade credit ratings could affect our ability to access capital, could increase our interest
rates, and could limit our ability to secure new contracts or business opportunities.
The success of our commercial relationships is
predicated on our ability to maintain our corporate investment grade ratings. Our credit risk is evaluated by major independent rating
agencies. Any future downgrades of our credit ratings could increase our cost of borrowing of any indebtedness we may incur. Adverse
changes in our investment grade credit ratings could affect our borrowing and bonding capacity and terms in the future, may increase our
interest expense or other costs of capital, or capital may not be available to us on competitive terms, or at all, and may reduce our ability to
secure new contracts or business opportunities with operating partners, suppliers, and customers, each of which would negatively impact
our financial performance. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our credit ratings, and any changes or downgrades
related to our credit ratings, including any announcement that our ratings are under review for a downgrade, may have a negative impact
on our liquidity, capital position, bonding capacity, and access to credit.
We enter into fixed-price contracts with our customers and our failure to mitigate certain risks associated with such contracts
may result in reduced operating margins.
Some of our contracts have been established on a fixed-price basis which commit us to a
specific price well before the completion of the applicable project. However, actual revenues or costs may be different from those we
originally estimated and may result in reduced profitability or losses on projects. Some of these risks include:
•
difficulties encountered on our large-scale projects related to the procurement of materials or due to schedule disruptions, product
performance failures, unforeseen site conditions, rejection clauses in customer contracts, or other factors that may result in
additional costs to us, reductions in revenue, claims, or disputes;
•
our inability to obtain compensation for additional work we perform or expenses we incur as a result of unanticipated technical
issues or our customers providing deficient design, engineering information, products, or materials;
•
reliance on historical cost and/or execution data that is not representative of current conditions, including as a result of inflation
and increases in labor and material costs;
•
delays or productivity issues caused by weather conditions, or other force majeure events (e.g., pandemics);
•
requirements to pay liquidated or other damages, upon our failure to meet schedule or performance requirements of our contracts;
•
difficulties in engaging third-party subcontractors, product manufacturers, or materials suppliers or failures by third-party
subcontractors, product manufacturers, or materials suppliers to perform could result in project delays and cause us to incur
additional costs; and
•
modifications to projects that create unanticipated costs or delays.
As a result of one or more of these factors, we may incur losses or contracts may not be as profitable as we expect, and this could
materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition.
Risks Relating to Industry Dynamics
The strategic priorities and financial performance of many of our businesses are subject to market and other dynamics related to
decarbonization, which can pose risks in addition to opportunities.
Given the nature of our businesses and the industries we serve,
we must anticipate and respond to market, technological, regulatory, governmental policy, and other changes driven by broader trends
related to decarbonization efforts in response to climate change and energy security. In particular, we provide products, solutions, and
services to utilities and other customers in the power generation sector, which has historically been carbon intensive and has been in the
midst of a transition with global efforts to lower greenhouse gas emissions. For example, the significant decreases in recent years in the
cost of energy for renewable sources of power generation (such as wind and solar), along with ongoing changes in government, investor,
2024 FORM 10-K
14
customer and consumer policies, commitments, preferences, and considerations related to climate change, in some cases have adversely
affected, and may continue to affect, the demand for and the competitiveness of products, solutions, and services related to fossil fuel-
based power generation, including sales of new gas turbines and the utilization and servicing needs for existing gas power plants that are
unmitigated with capabilities such as hydrogen or carbon capture. Conversely, increased government policy focus on fossil fuel generation
and use, and reversion of existing policies to facilitate implementation of renewable energy sources in the various jurisdictions in which our
products are sold, may result in reduced demand for our renewable energy products and services, including decarbonization.
Continued shifts toward greater penetration by renewables in both new capacity additions and the proportionate share of power generation,
particularly depending on the pace and timeframe for such shifts across different industries globally, could have a material adverse effect on
the performance of our Power segment and our consolidated results. We also face risks and uncertainties for those businesses related to
future levels and timeframes of government subsidies and credits (including the impact of the IRA in the U.S. and other U.S. and global
policies), timeframes for negotiations with regulators, significant price competition among product manufacturers, competition with solar
power-based and other sources of renewable energy, the risk that a segment of the renewable energy industry may be deprioritized, the
pace at which power grids are modernized to maintain reliability with higher levels of renewables penetration, and industry-wide shifts in
profitability levels.
Our long-term success depends on our ability to effectively address both electrification and decarbonization, which over time will require
adapting our technology portfolio to changing customer preferences and government policies and scaling innovative low-carbon and
carbon-neutral technologies. If we fail or are perceived to not be adequately advancing decarbonization objectives, or if investors or
financial institutions shift funding away from companies in fossil fuel-related industries, our and our customers’ access to capital could be
negatively impacted. Furthermore, governments may enact or implement policies that impact these dynamics as they pertain to us or our
customers in unforeseeable ways. The achievement of decarbonization goals for the electric power industry over the coming decades is
also likely to depend in part on technologies that are not yet deployed or widely adopted today but that may become more important over
time (such as hydrogen-based power generation, carbon capture and sequestration technologies, small modular or other advanced nuclear
power and grid-scale batteries or other storage solutions). Successfully navigating these changes will require significant investments in
power grids and other infrastructure, R&D, and new technology and products, both by us and third parties. Our success in advancing
decarbonization objectives across our businesses will also depend in part on the actions of governments, regulators and other market
participants to invest in infrastructure, create appropriate market incentives and to otherwise support the development of new technologies
in time to take advantage of existing or emerging market opportunities. Considering the above, there is no assurance that we will be
successful in addressing effectively either electrification or decarbonization.
The process of developing new high-technology products and enhancing existing products to address the impact of climate change is often
complex, costly and uncertain, and we may pursue strategies or make investments that do not prove to be commercially successful in the
timeframes expected or at all. If the decarbonization landscape changes faster than anticipated or in a manner that we do not anticipate,
demand for our products, solutions, and services could be adversely affected.
Demand
for certain of our products, solutions, and services, particularly in our Power segment, depend on oil and gas regulatory
policy, prices and global and regional supply and demand, and technological innovations and efficiencies, which are subject to
factors beyond our control and may adversely affect our operating results.
Demand for certain of our products, solutions, and
services, particularly in our Power segment, is partially affected by oil and gas regulatory policy, prices, and demand for oil and, in
particular, gas, which are subject to factors beyond our control. Several U.S. and international pledges, agreements, and initiatives, such as
those adopted at the 2023 United Nations Climate Change Conference (
COP28
), resulted in more stringent regulations on oil and gas
operations, which could impact production costs, reduce oil and gas demand, and curtail future investments in gas turbine generation. The
oil and gas segment could also experience a reduction in utilization by the switch away from gas to other sources of energy if prices for
such alternative sources are lower than those for gas.
Energy prices could impact many of our customers’ cash flows and their ability to fund exploration and development activities. Because
prices of oil and gas products are set on a commodity basis, the volatility in oil and gas prices and demand can impact our customers’
activity levels and spending for our products, solutions, and services. Expectations about future prices and price volatility are important for
determining future spending levels. Actual and anticipated increases in oil and gas prices (and corresponding low demand for oil and gas)
have in the past contributed to, and may in the future contribute to, an overall economic recession, which may raise risks across our
industries. During these periods, certain countries that are heavily dependent on income from oil and gas may curtail investments in capital
intensive oil and gas, power generation and transmission projects due to insufficient funds, which would also lead to less demand for
certain of our products, solutions, and services in our Power segment. Furthermore, persistently high gas prices as well as potential gas
shortages, which may be further exacerbated by the conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East, pose additional risks in particular for the
market for large gas turbines, including the service market.
Energy intensive technological innovations and efficiencies, such as artificial intelligence, may affect or may be perceived to affect
electricity demand and the related demand for our equipment and services. The nature and extent of this impact on demand is uncertain.
We may be unable to adjust our personnel and functional cost base fast enough to adapt to demand swings, which may result in under-or-
overcapacities. This inefficiency as well as sustained low demand for our products, solutions, and services, particularly in our Power
segment, could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial position, cash flows, and results of operations and could require
us to record asset impairments.
We could be subject to risks in connection with our ability to connect to power grids and our customers’ ability to sell the
electricity they generate or to establish grid connections efficiently.
The connection or access to a power grid is essential when it
comes to generating electricity. Factors beyond our control, such as regulatory constraints, permitting restrictions and delays, or system
failures, could impair our ability to connect our power generation products to the grid. If our customers fail to obtain a connection or access
to the transmission grids on a timely basis, or on economically reasonable terms and, as a result, they are delayed or prevented from
entering into an agreement (whether on a statutory or contractual basis) concerning the purchase of the electrical energy generated, the
timing of orders and/or project milestones could be impacted, and we could experience a material adverse effect on our business, results of
2024 FORM 10-K
15
operations, cash flows, and financial condition. Grid capacity constraints and the limited availability of land to build connection infrastructure
could further exacerbate the risks to our business.
There are statutory rules and regulations which govern the connection of power generation products to the power grid in the markets where
we operate. This helps ensure that grids are safe and stable and that there is sufficient supply of electricity. Moreover, the full transmission
and dispatch output of electricity may be curtailed as a result of various grid constraints, such as grid congestion, restrictions on
transmission capacity of the grid and restrictions on electricity dispatch during certain periods. Electricity transmission lines may experience
unplanned outages due to system failures, accidents and severe weather conditions, or planned outages due to repair and maintenance,
construction work and other reasons beyond our control. For example, as electricity generated from wind farms today is currently often not
stored and must be transmitted or used once it is generated, some of the wind turbines of a wind farm may be turned off during such period
when electricity is unable to be transmitted due to grid congestion or other grid constraints. Such events could reduce the actual net power
generation of the wind farms. In addition, a number of other factors may further decrease electricity output, including wind speed or wind
direction or other severe weather condition.
As a result, we and our customers may experience significant financial losses from inefficient electricity outputs, the inability to connect to
power grids, or grid capacity constraints, which may in turn cause the decrease in the demand for our products and could lead to a material
adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition.
Some of our operations involve the handling, use, transportation, and disposal of radioactive and hazardous materials, which
subject us and our customers to regulations, related costs and delays and potential liabilities for injuries and claims.
Our
operations involve the handling, use, transportation, and disposal of radioactive and hazardous materials, including nuclear fuel, nuclear
power devices and their components. The risks associated with radioactive materials and the public perception of those risks can affect our
business. Failure to properly handle radioactive and hazardous materials could pose a health risk to humans or wildlife and could cause
personal injury, property damage (including environmental contamination), and damage the health and safety of the surrounding
community. If an accident were to occur, its severity could be significantly affected by the nature of the accident and the speed of corrective
action taken by us and others, including emergency response personnel, as well as other factors beyond our control, such as weather and
wind conditions. In addition to health risks, a release of these materials may cause damage to, or the loss of, property and may adversely
affect property values. Actions taken in response to an accident could result in significant costs. Activities of our contractors, suppliers or
other counterparties similarly may involve toxic, hazardous, and radioactive materials and we may be liable contractually, or under
applicable law, to contribute to remedy damages or other costs arising from such activities.
Adverse public reaction to developments in the use of nuclear power or nuclear radiation could directly affect our customers and indirectly
affect our business. Adverse public reaction, increased regulatory scrutiny, and potential litigation and other legal challenges could
contribute to a slowdown in, or in some cases, a complete halt to new construction of nuclear power plants, an early shut down of existing
power plants, delays or resistance to reopening power plants that have been shut down, or a dampening of the favorable regulatory climate
needed to introduce new nuclear technologies. Negative public perceptions could also lead to increased regulation or limitations on the
activities of our customers, more onerous operating requirements, or other conditions that could have a material adverse impact on our
customers and our business.
We are subject to international, federal, state, and local regulations governing handling, use, transportation, and disposal of radioactive and
hazardous materials. These requirements are complex and subject to frequent change. Our compliance with amended, new, or more
stringent requirements, stricter interpretations of existing requirements, or the future discovery of contamination may require us to make
material expenditures or subject us to liabilities that we currently do not anticipate. Such expenditures and liabilities may adversely affect
our business, results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition.
We seek to protect ourselves from liability associated with accidents through contractual precautions with our counterparties, but there can
be no assurance that such contractual limitations on liability will be effective in all cases or that our or our counterparties’ insurance will
cover all the liabilities we have assumed under those contracts. While we maintain insurance coverage as part of our overall risk
management strategy, these policies do not protect us against all liabilities associated with accidents or for unrelated claims. The costs of
defending against a claim arising out of an incident involving radioactive or hazardous materials, such as a precautionary evacuation, and
any damages awarded as a result of such a claim, could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition.
Wind energy is a variable source of electricity and is susceptible to the impacts of weather conditions and other seasonal factors
and constraints.
Due to the variable availability of wind energy, coupled with various transmission limitations, such as grid congestion
caused by the underdevelopment of the local power grids and temporary transmission interruptions caused by system upgrades, wind
power may not be a viable base load source of electricity. As such, while demand for wind power is expected to increase, there are
challenges to wind power becoming a large-scale substitute for other energy sources unless special technologies (e.g., energy storage) are
developed to ensure a more stable and reliable output of electricity generated by the wind power industry. We cannot be certain that our
efforts to develop and introduce advanced wind technologies will be successful, or how successful wind power will be as a larger share of
total power generation over a long horizon. If future developments or innovations in the wind power industry are less successful than those
of other energy sources, there may be a negative impact on the future prospects of the wind power industry, which, in turn, could materially
and adversely affect the demand for our products, solutions, services, and platforms.
The generation of wind power depends on wind conditions and patterns, which are inherently uncertain and difficult to predict or anticipate.
Sales of our wind turbines and the provision of related technical services are subject to seasonal variations since the delivery and
installation of our wind turbines depend on the construction cycles of wind farm projects by our customers. The installation and
maintenance of offshore wind turbines can be particularly impacted by weather-related scheduling delays due to their complex
infrastructure, higher wind speeds, and the challenges of accessing offshore sites. Adverse events relating to our wind business operations
during peak demand periods can create unpredictability in activity and utilization rates and affect demand for our support services.
Furthermore, wind turbine specifications must be suitable for the wind conditions expected at a particular site. Therefore, unavailability of
locations that are suitable for the wind turbines we offer would have a negative impact on our sales and thus materially adversely affect our
business, results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition.

Risks Relating to Macroeconomic and Geopolitical Conditions
Our business is exposed to risks associated with the volatile global economic environment and geopolitical conditions.
Adverse
changes in economic or geopolitical conditions, particularly in locations where our customers, suppliers, or operations are located, as well
as concerns about a range of other external factors including global trade and global supply chain, developments in energy prices, inflation,
interest rates, changes in government monetary or fiscal policies, import or export restrictions, tariffs, labor market challenges,
currenc
y
exchange rate volatility, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition and
may adversely impact the demand for our products, solutions, and services. Rising inflation and interest rates may increase our cost of
capital and could reduce the number of customers who purchase our products, solutions, and services as credit becomes more expensive
or less available. The consequences of geopolitical conflicts, including the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine, the conflicts in the
Middle East, and possible conflicts that could emerge in other geopolitically sensitive areas, such as the Taiwan Strait and broader Asia
Pacific region, which have resulted in sanctions and other measures imposed by the EU, the U.S., and other countries in response, have
also caused and may continue to cause disruption and instability in global markets, supply chains and industries that negatively impact our
businesses, results of operations, cash flows, financial condition, and pose reputational risks. In addition, our customers and suppliers
could be affected directly by an economic downturn and some could face credit issues or cash flow problems that could give rise to
payment delays, increased credit risk, bankruptcies, and other financial hardships, which could adversely impact customer demand for our
products as well as our ability to manage normal commercial relationships with our customers and suppliers. Depending on their severity
and duration, the effects and consequences of global economic and political conditions could have an adverse impact on our results of
operations, cash flows, and financial condition.
Unexpected events, such as natural disasters, geopolitical conflicts, pandemics, and other events beyond our control, may
increase our cost of doing business or disrupt our operations.
The occurrence of one or more unexpected events, including
geopolitical conflicts (such as the Russia-Ukraine conflict and the conflicts in the Middle East), acts of terrorism or violence, civil unrest,
fires, tornadoes, tsunamis, hurricanes, earthquakes, floods and other forms of severe weather in regions in which we operate or in which
our suppliers are located could adversely affect our operations and financial performance. Natural disasters, product failures, power
outages or other unexpected events could result in physical damage to and complete or partial closure of one or more of our manufacturing
facilities or distribution centers, temporary or long-term disruption in the supply of component products from local and international
suppliers, and disruption and delay in the transport of our products to project sites and distribution centers. A public health epidemic or
pandemic poses the risk that our employees, contractors, suppliers, customers, and other business partners may be prevented from
conducting business activities for an indefinite period of time, including due to shutdowns, travel restrictions, or other actions that may be
requested or mandated by governmental authorities, or that such epidemic or pandemic may otherwise interrupt or impair business
activities. Our operations and financial performance were negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic that caused a slowdown of
economic activity, disruptions in global supply chains, and significant volatility and disruption of financial markets. Existing insurance
coverage may not provide protection for all the costs that may arise from such events, and any incidents may result in loss of, or increased
costs of, such insurance. In addition, while we have disaster recovery and business continuity plans (including those relating to our
information technology systems), they may not be fully responsive to, or capable of eliminating or materially minimizing losses associated
with, catastrophic events. As a result, any business disruption could still negatively affect our business, operating results, cash flows, or
financial condition.
Political and economic instability, restrictive trade policies, restrictions on the repatriation of funds, and export and import restrictions may
disrupt our supply chain and impact our ability to generate products, solutions, and services to meet customer demands. The prices of raw
materials and other components that we use in production may increase and be susceptible to significant fluctuations due to trends in
supply and demand, commodity prices, currency exchange rates, transportation costs, government regulations and tariffs, price controls,
and economic conditions, among other factors. In addition, various geopolitical factors, including the level of economic activity in China, the
conflict in Ukraine, and the conflicts in the Middle East, have added to the volatility in energy costs. These circumstances may have a
substantial adverse impact on our business activities, results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition.
Our business, results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition could be adversely affected by any negative impact on
the global economy and financial markets resulting from the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine.
Global markets
experienced volatility and disruption as a result of the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine. Although the length and impact of the
ongoing conflict is highly unpredictable, the conflict in Ukraine has contributed and could continue to contribute to volatility in global
financial markets, energy costs, and commodity prices and exacerbate existing supply chain constraints. Additionally, the conflict in Ukraine
has led to sanctions and other penalties being levied by the United States, European Union, and other countries against Russia. Additional
potential sanctions and penalties have also been proposed and/or threatened. Our business and financial performance have been
negatively impacted by the sanctions and penalties implemented in response to the conflict between Russia and Ukraine. For example, in
2022 we recognized $0.2 billion of pre-tax charges primarily from impairments of receivables, inventory, contract assets, and equity method
investments directly resulting from the sanctions relating to this conflict, predominantly related to our Power business. Due to the expansion
of U.S. sanctions in 2023, we recognized an additional pre-tax charge of $0.1 billion primarily from impairments of inventory, receivables,
and contract assets.
While our remaining net asset exposure to Russia is not material, we continue to actively monitor the dynamic
situation in Ukraine and applicable laws, sanctions, and trade control restrictions resulting from the conflict. The extent to which our
operations and financial results may be affected by the ongoing conflict in Ukraine will depend on various factors, including the extent and
duration of the conflict; the effects of the conflict on regional and global economic and geopolitical conditions; the effects of further laws,
sanctions, and trade control restrictions on our business, the global economy, and global supply chains; and the impact of fluctuations in
the exchange rate of the ruble. Continuation or escalation of the conflict may also magnify the impact of other risks identified in this
Information Statement, including cybersecurity, regulatory, and reputational risks
Risks Relating to Competition and Managing Growth
We operate in highly competitive environments. Our failure to compete successfully could adversely affect our results of
operations, cash flows, and financial condition.
Our products, solutions, and services are subject to significant competitive pressures,
and in many of the industries in which we operate we face intense competition from both international and domestic competitors. The
continual development of advanced technologies, new and existing products and solutions including product enhancements, and high
2024 FORM 10-K
17
quality but cost-effective supply chain, production, and delivery methods are critical to remaining competitive by maintaining commercially
attractive products, solutions, and services at acceptable pricing levels. A change in the strategic priorities of our business or a failure to
anticipate or respond quickly to a number of factors including technological developments, evolving industry standards, new regulations or
incentives, changing customer demands, supply chain issues, or innovations in production techniques in the industries we serve could
cause us to experience lower revenues, price erosion, lower margins, and could result in forgone growth opportunities. Competition has
also intensified as a result of international expansion by existing industry participants exploiting new markets and increasing pressure from
competitors from other regions who strive to improve the quality and reliability of their technologies and expand beyond their existing
markets. For example, China is a large manufacturer and developer of wind equipment and technology and Chinese wind turbine
manufacturers may increasingly pursue selling their wind turbine products in markets outside of China. The entry of new market
participants could further intensify competition.
Moreover, some of our competitors receive financial and other assistance from their
governments, which may allow them to have a longer-term investment approach and greater risk tolerance to realizing returns and other
benefits from their investments and business strategies and execution than may be available to companies, such as us, that do not have
similar governmental funding and assistance.
If we are unable to respond successfully to these competitive pressures, our business, results
of operations, cash flows, and financial condition may be adversely affected.
Our business strategy may include acquisitions, investments, joint ventures, partnerships, or divestitures to support our growth
and financial performance, and our failure to successfully execute these transactions could adversely affect our business.
Our
business strategy may include the acquisition, in part or in whole, of technologies and businesses that expand or complement our existing
businesses. Successful growth through acquisitions depends upon our ability to identify suitable acquisition targets or assets, conduct due
diligence, negotiate transactions on favorable terms, and ultimately complete such transactions and integrate the acquired target or asset
successfully. Certain transactions may be subject, in certain circumstances, to the consent of
GE
under the Tax Matters Agreement, as
discussed in “—Risks Relating to the Spin-Off.”
Transactions may expose us to significant risks and uncertainties, including:
•
competition for targets and assets, which may lead to substantial increases in purchase price or terms that are less attractive to
us;
•
failure to timely integrate or separate acquired or divested companies’ assets, people, and products;
•
failure to comply with laws and regulations, including any required disclosures and filings, in one or multiple jurisdictions in relation
to a transaction;
•
expenses, delays, and difficulties in integrating acquired businesses into our existing businesses;
•
diversion of our management’s attention from existing operations to the
acquisition
and integration process, as applicable;
•
dependence on external sources of capital, in particular to finance the purchase price of Transactions;
•
rulings by antitrust or other regulatory bodies;
•
acquired companies’ previous failures to comply with applicable legal, regulatory or other governmental requirements;
•
inability to produce products at increased scale or loss of previously available distribution channels;
•
heightened external scrutiny on acquired IP rights, or lack of IP rights for the acquired portfolio;
•
a failure to accurately predict or to realize expected growth opportunities, cost savings, synergies, and market acceptance of
acquired companies’ products;
•
a failure to identify or appropriately assess material issues, problems or liabilities during due diligence review of acquisition targets
(or its agents) prior to acquisition;
•
successor liability imposed by regulators for actions by the target (or its agents) prior to acquisition;
•
continued losses and exposures for liabilities not transferred to a buyer or otherwise divested in a divestiture;
•
difficulties in retaining key customers and personnel; and
•
adverse market reactions to a transaction.
Various other assessments and assumptions regarding a transaction may prove to be incorrect, and actual developments may differ
significantly from our expectations.
In addition, we also regularly evaluate a variety of potential strategic transactions, including equity method investments, joint ventures and
other strategic alliances that could further our strategic business objectives. We may not successfully identify, assess, or manage the risks
presented by these strategic transactions, including those outlined above. Equity investments and other strategic alliances pose additional
risks, as we could share ownership in both public and private companies and in some cases management responsibilities with one or more
other parties whose objectives for the alliance may diverge from ours over time, who may not have the same priorities, strategies, or
resources as we do, or whose interpretation of applicable policies may differ from our own.
Our business strategy may also include the divestiture of certain assets or operating units in order to enable the redeployment of capital.
We may encounter difficulty in finding buyers or face other limitations such as regulatory, governmental, or contractual requirements that
could delay or prevent the accomplishment of our objectives and adversely affect our business. These limitations include the provisions of
the Separation and Distribution Agreement described under “Certain Relationships and Related Person Transactions—Agreements with GE
—Separation and Distribution Agreement—Credit Support” in the Information Statement.
The occurrence of any of the above in connection with any
transaction c
ould have a material adverse effect on our business results, cash
flows, financial condition, or prospects.
There are risks associated with our joint venture arrangements, consortiums, and similar collaborations with third parties for
certain projects, which could impose additional costs and obligations on us.
We have entered and expect to continue to enter into
joint venture arrangements for manufacturing and commercial operations and/or project development and funding. We also enter into
agreements with third parties to act as a consortium to perform projects.
Our joint venture arrangements may expose us to risks, including risks with respect to the economic, political, and regulatory environment
of any foreign entities with which we partner, legal and regulatory violations committed by partners whose actions are outside of our control,
2024 FORM 10-K
18
and risks associated with contractual, governmental or certain exclusivity obligations with partners that may impose operational restrictions
on us. Furthermore, these arrangements may require us to incur non-recurring and other charges, increase expenditures, or disrupt our
ordinary business activities. If joint venture, consortium, or other strategic partners cannot meet their obligations due to financial or other
difficulties, including if they declare bankruptcy or otherwise modify their capital structure, we could be required to provide additional
investment or services or take responsibility for breaches of contracts or assume additional financial or operational obligations which could
have a substantial adverse impact on our business, results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition.
We currently have equity interests in multiple joint ventures and expect to enter into additional joint venture arrangements in the future. Our
influence over these entities varies depending on the level and nature of ownership and/or rights agreed, and for some of these entities our
influence may be limited. Even in joint ventures where we have greatest influence, we are usually required to reach consensus with our
joint venture partners in connection with major decisions concerning the operations of the joint ventures. This could create the risk of
impasses on decisions, given that our partners in these arrangements may have economic or business interests that diverge from our
interests. Additionally, differences in views among the joint venture participants may result in delayed decisions or disputes. Conflicts may
arise in these arrangements concerning the achievement of performance milestones or the interpretation of significant terms under any
agreement (including financial obligations), termination rights, or the ownership or control of IP developed during the arrangement. We also
cannot control the actions of our joint venture partners. We sometimes have joint and several liabilities with our joint venture partners under
the applicable contracts for joint venture projects and we cannot be certain that our partners will be able to satisfy any potential liability that
could arise. These factors could potentially harm the business and operations of a joint venture and, in turn, our business and operations.
In addition, our arrangements involving joint ventures may restrict us from gaining access to the cash flows or assets of these entities. In
some cases, our joint ventures have governmentally imposed restrictions on their abilities to transfer funds to us.
In addition, success on consortium projects depends in part on whether our consortium partners fulfill their contractual obligations. Such
projects are subject to the risk that our consortium partners may block or delay decisions which could be integral to the success of the
project or investments in the project, or could implement strategies that are contrary to our economic interests, resulting in a lower return
than expected. If any of these third parties fails to perform its contractual obligations satisfactorily, we may be required to provide or procure
added services to compensate for such failure. Such third-party failures may also expose us to reputational harm as well as complaints
from customers and other counterparties. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business results, cash flows,
financial condition, or prospects.
Our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to develop and introduce new technologies.
In many of the industries in which
we operate, technologies change rapidly, and customer needs evolve regularly. Our future growth will depend on our ability to continue to
innovate by developing and commercializing new products, solutions, and services. The commercial success of new technologies, such as
hydrogen-based power generation, carbon capture and sequestration technologies, small modular or other advanced nuclear power and
grid-scale batteries or other storage solutions, depends on many factors, including the pace of innovation, the development costs and the
availability of capital resources to fund those costs, the levels of competition from others developing similar or other competing
technologies, our ability to obtain or maintain government permits or certifications, the effectiveness of our production, distribution, and
marketing efforts, the availability of raw materials and components, and the costs to customers to deploy and provide support for the new
technologies. Also, overall market demand, growth, and acceptance of our new innovations remain key to their success, as well as the
timing of when we bring these offerings to market. If and to the extent these predictions are proved wrong, our investments in new
products, solutions, and services may not achieve revenue or profits at all or the recovery of investments may be over an extended period.
Unsuccessful efforts to develop and adapt our products, solutions, and services could ultimately result in lower revenue, lower margins,
and/or higher costs, which could harm our competitive position and adversely impact our financial performance.
We face a complex global operating environment, particularly in emerging markets.
Due to our global nature, we deal with a range of
legal and regulatory systems with varying requirements. Due to the nature of our projects and products, we face risks associated with
engagements with foreign officials and government agencies, including the risks of complying with diverse procedures and standards
imposed by (among others) the FCPA and similar anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions. We also face risks associated
with compliance with global privacy and data security laws and regulations. Navigating a variety of legal and regulatory regimes may
increase the difficulty of compliance, particularly as such laws change or are interpreted in unexpected ways. In addition, as an employer of
permanent and fixed-term contract employees and contractors, we are required to create compensation programs, employment policies
and other administrative programs that comply with the laws of multiple countries. We also must communicate, monitor, and uphold group-
wide standards and directives across our global network, including in relation to our suppliers, subcontractors, and other relevant
stakeholders. Our failure to manage our geographically diverse operations successfully could impair our ability to react quickly to changing
business and market conditions and to enforce compliance with group-wide standards and procedures.
Risks Relating to Government Regulations and Legal Matters
Policies may alter the demand mix for our products in unfavorable ways. Any reductions or the elimination of governmental
incentives or policies that support renewable energy could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations,
cash flows, financial condition, and prospects.
Parts of our business benefit significantly from government policies that support utility
scale renewable energy and enhance the economic feasibility of such projects in regions in which we operate or plan to develop and
operate renewable energy facilities. In a number of economic regions and countries, notably in the U.S., EU, Japan, and South Korea, the
federal governments and some state and other local governments provide incentives, such as tax incentives, renewable portfolio
standards, or feed-in-tariffs, that support or are designed to support the sale of energy from utility scale renewable energy facilities, such as
wind, hydro, and solar energy facilities and support the manufacture of products to be used in these facilities. As a result of budgetary
constraints, political factors or otherwise, governments from time to time may review such laws and policies and take actions that would be
less conducive to the development and operation of renewable energy facilities or to the manufacture of products for these facilities. Any
reductions or the elimination of governmental incentives or policies that support renewable energy, such as the imposition of additional
taxes or other assessments on renewable energy, could result in the lack of a satisfactory market for the development and/or financing of
new renewable energy projects, our abandoning the development of renewable energy projects, reduced return on the manufacture of
products for these facilities, or a loss of our investments in such projects or reduced project returns from such projects. Additionally, a broad
decline in public support or a rollback of policy support for renewable energy technologies could adversely impact our business.

In the U.S., the IRA includes incentives for development and production of renewable energy. In particular, the IRA extends the availability
of investment tax credits (ITCs) and production tax credits (PTCs) to certain renewable energy projects and provides a credit for the
manufacture of qualifying products. We and our tax equity partners benefit from ITCs and PTCs with respect to qualifying renewable energy
projects. In structuring tax equity partnerships and determining ITC and PTC eligibility, we have relied upon applicable tax law and
published In
ternal Revenue Service (IRS) guidanc
e. However, the application of law and guidance regarding ITC and PTC eligibility to the
facts of particular renewable energy projects is subject to a number of uncertainties. The IRS, Department of Treasury, and Congress may
modify existing guidance with respect to the application of the IRA, possibly with retroactive effect. We may face uncertainties as a result of
efforts to pass legislation to repeal, substantially modify, or invalidate some or all of the provisions of the IRA. Additionally, our operations
and strategic plans may have to change if certain provisions of the IRA were to be repealed, modified, or invalidated. Furthermore, there
can be no assurance that the IRS will agree with our approach in the event of an audit. Any of the foregoing items could reduce the amount
of ITCs or PTCs available to us and our tax equity partners. In this event, we could be required to adjust the terms of future tax equity
partnerships or seek alternative sources of funding for renewable energy projects, each of which could have a material adverse effect on
our business, financial condition, cash flows, results of operations, and prospects. We expect to claim credits associated with the
manufacture of qualified products. We rely on applicable tax law and guidance to determine the amount of these credits. However, the
Department of the Treasury or IRS may issue additional guidance that may reduce our eligibility for
credits
or may disagree with our
interpretation of the applicable tax law in the event of an audit. Our business could also be adversely affected by the loss or significant
reduction in access to U.S. government technology grants and related funding programs. Beyond incentives policies, new environmental
regulatory actions or significant modifications to existing policies of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), such as the EPA’s
announcement in April 2023 of proposed new air emissions standards for natural gas operators, could increase our operating costs or
impede sales of our products, solutions, and services.
In Europe, we benefit from a number of government-sponsored programs, incentives, and initiatives related to renewable energy. In
December 2020, the EU agreed to reduce net EU greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% by 2030, compared to 1990 levels. In May
2022, the EU announced the REPowerEU plan which seeks to rapidly reduce the EU’s dependence on fossil fuels by 2027. Furthermore,
the EU introduced the Green Deal Industrial Plan that is expected to further accelerate the expansion of renewable energy and green
technologies including easing state aid rules to enable higher subsidies. A key component of the Green Deal Industrial Plan is the Net Zero
Industry Act to simplify regulations, speed up permits and promote cross-border projects to accelerate climate neutrality. There can be no
assurance that these EU regulations will remain in effect in their present form or at all, and the elimination, reduction, or modification of
these regulations could materially harm our renewable energy programs.
International, national, and state governments and agencies continue to evaluate and promulgate legislation and regulations that are
focused on reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Caps or fees on carbon emissions have been and may continue to be established and the
cost of such caps or fees could disproportionately affect the fossil- fuel sectors. While such legislation and regulations could boost demand
for our technologies that contribute to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, such as hydrogen and carbon capture technologies,
compliance with greenhouse gas emission legislation and regulations applicable to our or our customers’ operations may have significant
implications that could adversely affect our business and operating results.
Failure to meet ESG (including sustainability) expectations or standards or achieve our ESG goals could adversely affect our
business, results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition.
There has been an increased focus from regulators and
stakeholders on
ESG
matters. These include areas such as greenhouse
gas emissions and climate-related risks that are particularly
relevant for the industries we serve and our businesses, as well as inclusive employment practices and equal employment opportunities
,
responsible sourcing, human rights and social responsibility, and corporate governance. We have established sustainability goals aligned
with certain ESG goals and targets. Our ability to accomplish them presents numerous operational, regulatory, financial, legal, and other
challenges, several of which are outside of our control.
Increasing focus on ESG factors has led to enhanced interest in the review of performance results by investors and other stakeholders and
the potential for litigation and reputational risk. Some investors have used, and may continue to use, ESG criteria to guide their investment
strategies, and may not invest in us, or divest their holdings of us, if they believe our policies relating to ESG matters are inadequate. Our
voluntary disclosures of ESG data under standards such as the Global Reporting Initiative, the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board
(
SASB
), and recommendations issued by the Financial Stability Board’s Task Force for Climate-related Financial Disclosures (
TCFD
) are
evaluated and rated by various organizations that assess corporate ESG performance. Unfavorable ESG ratings, or our inability to meet
the ESG standards set by specific investors, may lead to unfavorable sentiment toward us, which could have a negative impact, among
other things, on our stock price and cost of capital. Regulatory requirements related to ESG or sustainability reporting have been adopted in
the EU that apply or will apply to us when effective, due to our revenues and employee populations in the EU, including the EU
CSRD
, EU
Taxonomy, and the EU
CSDDD
.
In the U.S., such regulations have been issued requiring carbon emissions and climate risk disclosures in
California, related to pension investments in California, and for the responsible investment of public funds in Illinois.
Additional regulation is
pending at the SEC, at the federal level for government contractors, and in other states. Globally, we anticipate an increase in carbon
emissions and climate risk disclosure requirements under the International Sustainability Standards Board framework, such as the recently
adopted Australian climate-related financial disclosures legislation. We expect regulatory requirements related to ESG matters to continue
to expand globally, particularly in the EU. We may be affected by our ability to meet evolving and expanding emissions reporting
requirements and by investor and public perception of our reporting and performance related to voluntary climate standards. Given the
increasing scrutiny on ESG matters as well as the increasing number of regulatory obligations relating to our business, there is also an
increasing risk that we could be perceived as or accused of making inaccurate or misleading statements regarding our performance against
ESG-related measures and/or ESG initiatives.
Failure to achieve our ESG goals, commitments and targets or comply with emerging ESG regulations could adversely affect our business,
results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition. Changes in ESG regulations could lead to additional operational restrictions and
compliance requirements upon us or our products, require new or additional investment in product designs, result in carbon offset
investments or otherwise could negatively impact our business and/or competitive position. Any such failure could harm our reputation,
adversely impact our ability to attract and retain customers and talent and expose us to increased scrutiny from the investment community
and enforcement authorities.

International trade policies may impact demand for our products and our competitive position.
Changes in government policies on
foreign trade and investment can affect the demand for our products solutions, and services, impact our competitive position, subject us to
escalating costs, or prevent us from being able to offer our products, solutions, and services in certain countries. The implementation of
more restrictive trade policies, such as import or export controls, required licenses or authorizations to engage in business dealings with
certain countries or entities, higher tariffs, restrictions on outbound investment, more detailed inspections, exchange controls, a
government’s adoption of “buy national” policies, local production requirements, or other barriers to entry, in countries where we sell large
quantities of products, solutions, and services could be disruptive and costly to our business and could negatively impact our business,
results of operations, cash flows, financial condition, and prospects.
Failure to obtain or comply with federal, state and local government approvals, licenses, and permits may negatively affect our
ability to produce, market, and sell our products, solutions, and services.
Parts of our business are required to obtain, and to comply
with, federal, state, and local government approvals, licenses, and permits. Any of these approvals, licenses, or permits may be subject to
denial, revocation, or modification under various circumstances. Failure to obtain or comply with the conditions of approvals, licenses, or
permits may adversely affect our operations by suspending our activities or curtailing our work and may subject us to penalties and other
sanctions. For example, our nuclear operations in the U.S. are subject to regulation by the NRC. Failure to obtain approval or renewal of
our NRC licenses could result in significant disruptions to our nuclear business. Obtaining licenses and permits can be subject to extended
time delays due to governmental requirements and policies as well as local official processes and availability.
Although existing licenses are routinely renewed by various regulators, renewal could be denied or jeopardized by various factors, including
the failure to comply with EHS laws and regulations, the failure to comply with permit conditions, violations found during inspections or
otherwise, or local community, political, or other opposition.
In addition, concerns about climate change and increased environmental activism could slowdown regulatory approval of fossil fuel-based
power generation activities that could negatively impact the related products, solutions, and services we provide to customers. If new
legislation or regulations are enacted or implemented, or if existing laws or regulations are amended or are interpreted or enforced
differently, we may be required to obtain additional operating approvals, licenses, or permits. Moreover, changes in industry standards and
governmental regulations may cause us to incur substantial costs to adapt our products, solutions, and services. Our inability to obtain, and
to comply with, the approvals, licenses, or permits required for our business could have a material adverse effect on us. In addition, our
customers are often required to obtain, and comply with, approvals, licenses, or permits required for their businesses, and their failure to
obtain, or comply with, those approvals, licenses, or permits
may n
egatively impact our ability to provide products and services to them and
to execute our projects.
The physical effects of climate change, including weather disruptions and related effects, could adversely impact our business.
The physical effects of climate change can include extreme variability in weather patterns such as increased frequency and severity of
significant weather events (e.g., flooding, hurricanes, and tropical storms), natural hazards (e.g., increased wildfire risk), rising mean
temperature and sea levels, and long-term changes in precipitation patterns (e.g., drought, desertification, or poor water quality). Climate
change may also produce general changes in weather or other environmental conditions, including temperature or precipitation levels, and
thus may impact consumer demand for electricity generation. Such effects have the potential to affect business continuity and operating
results, and could disrupt our operations or those of our customers or suppliers, including through direct damage to physical assets and
indirect impacts from supply chain disruption and market volatility. These effects may negatively impact our business, results of operations,
cash flows, and prospects.
Our operations are subject to various EHS laws and regulations, and potential litigation, and non-compliance with or liabilities
under such laws and regulations could result in substantial costs, fines, sanctions, claims, additional regulatory oversight,
suspension of operations, and reputational harm.
We are subject to extensive domestic and international EHS regulations. In addition
to EHS regulatory compliance obligations, we may face liability arising out of the normal course of business, including alleged personal
injury, property damage, and human health risks due to exposure to hazardous substances, processes, or working conditions at our current
or former facilities. We may also face liability in connection with the actions or omissions of third-party contractors working at our project
sites or facilities. Any perceived or actual employee safety issues could result in substantial costs to us that may exceed our reserves, harm
our reputation, divert management’s attention, and could potentially affect our ability to continue operating in certain jurisdictions.
In addition, we may become subject to increased regulatory oversight and suspensions of our operations for events that may occur at our
projects. For example, we experienced a blade event during 2024 at our Vineyard Wind project, which, among other things, resulted in our
having to suspend operations at that project for an extended period and being subject to additional regulatory oversight at that project. See
Item 7. "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Offshore Wind" for further information.
We may be impacted by material changes in EHS regulations or subject to substantial liability for environmental impacts, both of which may
require increased capital expenditures. We may also be subject to increasingly stringent environmental standards in the future, particularly
as greenhouse gas emissions, and climate change regulations and initiatives increase and EHS laws and regulations grow in number and
complexity. Such laws and regulations may impose additional liability on industrial manufacturers for the use or generation of chemicals,
such as per/polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), contained in components and products sourced in connection with manufacturing and
services operations, and if adopted, may create additional liability, impact product design, manufacturing, and/or servicing and negatively
affect financial results. Environmental laws also generally impose liability for investigation, remediation, and removal of hazardous materials
and other waste products on property owners and those who dispose of materials at waste sites, whether or not the waste was disposed of
legally at the time in question. Some environmental laws provide for joint and several or strict liability for remediation of releases of
hazardous substances, which could result in us incurring a liability for environmental damage without regard to our negligence or fault.
Such laws and regulations could expose us to liability arising out of the conduct of operations or conditions caused by others, or for our acts
which were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time the acts were performed.

Our nuclear operations expose us to various additional environmental, regulatory, and financial risks, including:
•
potential liabilities relating to harmful effects on the environment and human health resulting from nuclear operations and the
storage, handling and disposal of radioactive materials;
•
unplanned expenditures relating to maintenance, operation, security, defects, upgrades and repairs required by the NRC and
other government agencies;
•
limitations on the amounts and types of insurance commercially available to cover losses that might arise in connection with
nuclear operations; and
•
potential liabilities arising out of a nuclear, radiological or criticality incident, whether or not it is within our control.
Our nuclear operations are subject to various safety-related requirements imposed by the U.S. Government, the Department of Energy, and
the NRC. In the event of non-compliance, these agencies might increase regulatory oversight, impose fines or shut down our operations,
depending upon the assessment of the severity of the situation. Revised security and safety requirements promulgated by these agencies
could necessitate substantial capital and other expenditures. In addition, we must comply with and are affected by laws and regulations
relating to the award, administration, and performance of U.S. Government contracts. Government contract laws and regulations affect how
we do business with our customers and, in some instances, impose added costs on our business. A violation of specific laws and
regulations could result in the imposition of fines and penalties or the termination of our contracts or debarment from bidding on contracts.
We may be subject to periodic claims, litigation, regulatory proceedings, and enforcement actions, which may adversely affect
our business and financial performance.
From time to time, we are involved in claims, lawsuits, regulatory proceedings, investigations,
and enforcement actions brought or threatened against us in the ordinary course of business. Our business is subject to the risk of claims
involving current and former employees, affiliates, subcontractors, suppliers, competitors, stockholders, government regulatory agencies or
others through private actions, class actions, whistleblower claims, administrative proceedings, regulatory actions, investigations, or other
proceedings. Additionally, we have had, and expect in the future to have, customers who assert contractual or other claims related to the
performance or design of our products, timeliness of delivery or other aspects of our commercial relationships. Given the nature of our
business, which often involves large projects and long-term commercial relationships, such claims, whether asserted in commercial
discussions, litigation or other types of proceedings, can be for significant amounts.
Global enforcement of anti-corruption laws, such as the FCPA, has increased substantially in recent years, with more frequent voluntary
self-disclosure by companies, aggressive investigations (including coordinated investigations across countries and governmental
authorities) and enforcement proceedings by U.S. and non-U.S. governmental agencies, and assessment of significant civil and criminal
fines, penalties, and other sanctions against companies and individuals. We may face liability under anti-corruption laws based upon
actions or inactions even when they are not subject to our control. Our global activities can also subject us to legacy legal proceedings and
legal compliance risks that relate to claimed anti-competitive conduct or improper payments of certain companies we acquire during the
pre-acquisition periods. Such investigations or government scrutiny may also impact our ability to participate in various governmental
financing programs and could limit our access to project financing from multilateral development banks and the World Bank.
Due to the inherent uncertainties associated with the resolution of claims, litigation, regulatory proceedings, investigations, and
enforcement actions, it is often difficult to accurately predict the ultimate outcome of any such actions or proceedings. The outcome of such
claims, actions, lawsuits, investigations, and proceedings, is often difficult to assess or quantify, as plaintiffs or regulatory agencies may
seek injunctive relief or recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts, and the magnitude of the potential loss may remain unknown for
substantial periods of time or until the time of a final judgment, award, order or settlement. Given that our business involves large scale
infrastructure projects and products and service contracts with a long duration, we are involved in commercial litigation or disputes from
time to time where the initial amounts claimed by counterparties have been and may be large, even if ultimately our liability or settlement
amounts to resolve such claims is significantly lower. In addition, plaintiffs in many types of actions may seek punitive damages, civil
penalties, consequential damages or other losses, or injunctive or declaratory relief.
Activist stockholders advocating for certain governance or strategic changes may also bring actions against us. These proceedings or
actions could result in substantial cost and may require us to devote substantial resources to defend ourselves and distract our
management from the operation of our business.
While we maintain insurance for certain potential liabilities, such insurance does not cover all types and amounts of potential liabilities and
is subject to various exclusions as well as caps on amounts recoverable. We may therefore incur significant expenses defending any such
suit or government charge and may be required to pay amounts or otherwise change our operations in ways that could adversely affect our
results of operations, and cash flows, and financial condition. For further information on material pending legal proceedings, see Note
22
in
the Notes to the consolidated and combined financial statements.
We are subject to antitrust and competition laws that can result in sanctions and conditions on the way we conduct our business.
We are subject to antitrust and competition laws, which generally prohibit certain types of conduct deemed to be anti-competitive, including
price fixing, bid rigging, cartel activities, price discrimination, market monopolization, tying arrangements, acquisitions of competitors,
allocation schemes, and other practices that have, may have, or are perceived to have an adverse effect on competition. Regulatory
authorities may have authority to impose fines and sanctions or to require changes or impose conditions on the way we conduct business
in connection with alleged non-compliance with applicable law. Under certain circumstances, violations of antitrust laws could result in
suspension or debarment of our ability to contract with certain parties or complete certain transactions. In addition, an increasing number of
jurisdictions also provide private rights of action for competitors or consumers to seek damages asserting claims of anti-competitive
conduct. Increased government scrutiny of our actions or enforcement or private rights of action could adversely affect our business or
damage our reputation. In addition, as previously reported by GE, the power and grid businesses that GE acquired from Alstom in 2015
were the subject of significant cases involving alleged anti-competitive conduct or improper payments by Alstom in the pre-acquisition
period. A number of these matters remain ongoing as we seek to resolve them, and it is possible that additional claims from legacy Alstom
conduct could arise in the future. Conducting internal investigations or responding to audits or investigations by government agencies could
be costly and time-consuming. An adverse outcome under any such investigation or audit could subject us to fines or criminal or other
penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on our business results, cash flows, financial condition, or prospects.
2024 FORM 10-K

We are subject to laws and regulations governing government contracts, public procurement, and government reimbursements
in many jurisdictions, and the failure to comply could adversely affect our business.
We have agreements relating to the sale of our
offerings to government entities around the world. As a result, we are subject to various statutes and regulations in a variety of jurisdictions
that apply to companies doing business with the government. The laws governing government contracts can differ from the laws governing
private contracts and government contracts may contain terms and conditions that are not applicable to private contracts or that expose us
to higher levels of risk and potential liability than non-government contracts. Similarly, most jurisdictions have public procurement laws and
reimbursement policies that set out rules and regulations for purchases and reimbursements by governmental entities. Certain countries
impose additional requirements on government suppliers as a prerequisite to doing business in the country including, among other things,
local headcount requirements, local manufacturing and supplier requirements, and technology or IP transfers. These jurisdictions may
modify their laws, policies, rules, or regulations, or impose new requirements that could adversely affect our business.
For contracts with the U.S. federal government, with certain exceptions, we must comply with the Federal Acquisition Regulation and
applicable agency rules, the Procurement Integrity Act, the Buy American Act, and/ or the Trade Agreements Act. Some governmental
entities, including the U.S. federal government, can terminate contracts for their convenience or for our default. These governmental
entities may also be subject to continued legislative funding approval. Early termination for convenience of one or more of our contracts, or
a change in a government customer’s funding levels, could impact our expected revenues. A termination for default of one or more of our
contracts could subject us to penalties and damages resulting from the default, including costs for the governmental entity to reprocure the
items under contract, in addition to other penalties previously listed. In addition, the U.S. federal government could invoke the Defense
Production Act, requiring that we accept and prioritize contracts for materials deemed necessary for national defense, regardless of loss in
revenue incurred on such contracts. In such circumstances, we may be required to reallocate time and resources away from our customers
to fulfill U.S. federal government requests under the Defense Production Act. This could cause us to be unable to fulfill contractual
obligations to non-U.S. federal government customers and harm long-term business relationships with our customers, suppliers, and
channel partners, which could adversely affect our business.
We are also subject to government audits, investigations, and oversight proceedings with respect to regulations governing government
contracts, public procurement, and government reimbursements. Efforts to ensure our business arrangements comply with applicable laws
involve substantial costs. It is possible that governmental and enforcement authorities will conclude that our business practices do not
comply with current or future laws and regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us, defense can be costly, time-consuming,
and may require significant financial and personnel resources. If we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those
actions could have a significant impact on our business, including the imposition of civil, criminal, and administrative penalties, damages,
disgorgement, monetary fines, individual imprisonment, possible exclusion from participation in certain government programs, contractual
damages, reputational harm, delayed or reduced payments, diminished profits and future earnings, and curtailment or restructuring of our
operations. In addition, any of our government contracts could be terminated or we could be suspended or debarred from all government
contract work or participation in projects involving multilateral development banks. Any of these risks could have a material adverse effect
on our business, results of operations, cash flows, financial condition, or prospects.
Our failure to comply with financial services regulatory obligations could damage our reputation, result in regulatory action
against us and adversely affect our business.
Certain of our affiliates are or intend to become a broker-dealer or a registered investment
adviser, as applicable, and will provide fee-based services in respect of the arranging and syndication of securities, transaction advisory
and structuring, and investment management inclusive of tax equity investments. For the first two years of GE Vernova’s existence, these
services will be provided to GE on a cost-basis. In the future, such services may be provided to third parties on an arms-length basis. For
more information, see “Certain Relationships and Related Person Transactions—Agreements with GE—Framework Investment
Agreement
”
in the Information Statement. While we believe these kinds of transactions are beneficial to our business, the functions that these affiliates
will perform may give rise to conflicts of interest, because these transactions will typically involve investments in large energy infrastructure
projects to which GE Vernova’s businesses will sell equipment and services. Such conflicts of interest, whether actual or perceived, may
result in potential litigation or regulatory enforcement actions. Broker-dealers are registered with the SEC and are members of self-
regulatory organizations such as FINRA. As such, they are subject to the regulations established under the Exchange Act and FINRA rules.
Registered investment advisers are registered with the SEC and are subject to the requirements and regulations of the Advisers Act. The
regulations to which broker-dealers and registered investment advisers are subject are extensive and evolving over time, and the level of
financial regulation has generally increased in recent years. A failure to comply with the obligations imposed by the Advisers Act, Exchange
Act or FINRA rules, including recordkeeping, advertising and operating requirements, disclosure obligations and prohibitions on fraudulent
activities, could result in examinations, investigations, sanctions, and reputational damage, and could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition, and results of operations. See Item 1. "Business—Regulation—Manufacturer and Servicer—Financial
Services" for further information.
Risks Relating to Employee Matters
If we are unable to attract and retain highly qualified personnel, we may not be able to execute our business strategy effectively
and our operations and financial results could be adversely affected.
Our operations and future success depend on our ability to
recruit, develop, and retain highly qualified personnel, particularly our senior management team, key employees and technical personnel,
and on our efficient utilization of our workforce. Our team members are the key resource to developing, manufacturing, and delivering our
products and providing technical services to our customers around the world. Some of our project sites involve placing team members in
geographically remote or high-risk locations, and we may expend significant efforts and incur substantial costs to satisfy employee safety
criteria and retain highly skilled personnel. For example, the installation, operation, and maintenance of offshore wind turbines is difficult,
labor intensive, and costly, and requires the availability of a highly skilled labor force. Notwithstanding our safety precautions and
compliance with applicable laws and regulations, we have experienced safety incidents that resulted in serious injury and death, involving
our employees and contractors, and we may be unable to avoid similar incidents in the future. Any safety concerns or incidents, regardless
of fault, could adversely affect our ability to attract additional qualified employees or contractors. Factors that may affect our ability to attract
and retain sufficient numbers of qualified employees and contractors include employee morale, our reputation, competition from other
employers, our ability to manage attrition, and availability of qualified individuals. Difficulties in hiring or retaining highly qualified personnel,
the failure to properly manage succession plans, or the unexpected loss of experienced employees resulting in the depletion of our
institutional knowledge base as well as difficulties in efficient utilization of our workforce could have an adverse impact on our business
2024 FORM 10-K
23
performance, reputation, results of operations, liquidity, or financial condition. Failure to ensure that we have the depth and breadth of
personnel with the necessary skill set and experience, or the loss of key employees, could impede our ability to deliver our growth
objectives and execute our strategy.
We have significant net liabilities with respect to our postretirement benefit plans, including pension, healthcare, and life
insurance benefits obligations, and the actual costs of these obligations could exceed current estimates and asset returns could
be less than current estimates.
As of December 31, 2024, our total postretirement benefit plans’ net liabilities for our employees, our
former employees, and certain legacy former employees unrelated to our core business and allocated to us by GE was approximately $1.7
billion.
These net liabilities arise under multiple benefit plans and statutory obligations in various countries. Increases in pension,
healthcare, and life insurance benefits obligations and costs and decreases in rate of return of associated assets can adversely affect our
earnings, cash flows, and financial condition. In addition, there may be upward pressure on the cost of providing healthcare benefits to
current and future retirees and there can be no assurance that the measures we have taken to control increases in these costs will succeed
and this could have a material adverse effect on our business results, cash flows, and financial condition. Most of the liabilities arise under
pension plans, including defined benefit pension plans,
and include plans that are fully funded, partly funded, or unfunded.
Our results of operations may be positively or negatively affected by the amount of income or expense we record for our defined benefit
pension plans. U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (
GAAP)
requires that we calculate income or expense for the plans using
actuarial valuations, which reflect assumptions about financial markets, interest rates, discount rate, and the expected long-term rate of
return on plan assets. We are also required to make an annual measurement of plan assets and liabilities, which may result in a significant
reduction or increase in equity. The factors that impact our pension calculations are subject to changes in key economic indicators, and
future decreases in the discount rate or low returns on plan assets can increase our funding obligations and adversely impact our financial
results. In addition, although U.S. GAAP expense and pension funding contributions are not directly related, key economic factors that
affect U.S. GAAP expense would also likely affect the amount of cash we would be required to contribute to pension plans under the
Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (
ERISA)
. Failure to achieve expected returns on plan assets driven by various factors,
including sustained market volatility, could also result in an increase in the amount of cash we would be required to contribute to pension
plans.
The defined benefit obligation is determined by actuarial assumptions such as the rate of compensation increase or pension progression
rate and biometric factors (such as participant mortality), as well as the discount rate applied. The basis for determining the discount rate is
in principle the yield on high-quality corporate bonds. A change of the discount rate and changes of the assessments of market yields used
may result in significant changes to the defined benefit obligation. Differences between actual experience and the predicted actuarial
assumptions, discount rates, and investment performance on plan assets can affect defined benefit plan liabilities.
We assumed certain liabilities from GE in connection with the Spin-Off, including some liabilities unrelated to our core business. For
example, we retained and assumed responsibility for certain liabilities for pension, healthcare, and life insurance benefits previously
provided to GE employees, including our employees, our former employees, and certain other legacy former employees unrelated to our
core business and allocated to us by GE.
We currently partially rely on estimates and assumptions made by GE with respect to the scope,
probability, and magnitude of these liabilities.
Such estimates and assumptions involve complex judgments which are difficult to make.
Actual developments may differ from estimates and assumptions, thereby resulting in an increase or decrease in our actual obligations for
these liabilities. Changes in economic conditions, financial markets, investment performance, or legal conditions governing these liabilities
can result in significant increases or decreases in the size of our actual obligations over time. Any of these factors and developments could
have a material adverse effect on our business results, cash flows, financial condition, or prospects. Furthermore, accounting standards
and legal conditions governing our pension obligations are subject to changes in applicable legislation, regulations, or case law. We cannot
provide any assurance that we will not incur new or more extensive pension obligations in the future due to such changes.
Any of these factors and developments could have a material adverse effect on our business results, cash flows, financial condition, or
prospects. For a discussion regarding how our financial statements have been and can be affected by our pension and healthcare benefit
obligation, see Note
13
in the Notes to the consolidated and combined financial statements.
Disruptions caused by labor disputes or organized labor activities could harm our business.
A significant number of our employees
around the world are members of, or represented by, labor unions and are covered by collective bargaining agreements with varying
durations and expiration dates. Many of our European employees belong to, or are represented by, works councils. Union and works
council requirements may limit our flexibility in managing costs and responding to market changes. In addition, employees who are not
currently members of, or otherwise represented by, labor organizations may seek such membership or representation, as applicable, in the
future.
We cannot ensure that existing collective bargaining agreements will prevent a strike or work stoppage at our facilities in the future, that we
will be successful in negotiating new collective bargaining agreements, that such negotiations will not result in significant increases in the
cost of labor, including healthcare, pensions, or other benefits, or that a breakdown in such negotiations will not result in the disruption of
our operations, including by way of strikes or work stoppages. In addition, negotiations with labor unions, possible work stoppages and
other labor problems could divert management attention, which could further harm our business. Furthermore, some of our customers and
suppliers have unionized work forces. We may experience an adverse impact on our operating results, financial condition, cash flows, and
competitive position if we are subject, directly or indirectly, to labor actions by our or our suppliers’ or customers’ employees, or as a result
of general country strikes or work stoppages unrelated to our business or collective bargaining agreements.
Our reputation and our ability to conduct business may be impaired by improper conduct by any of our employees, agents, or
business partners.
Misconduct, fraud, non-compliance with applicable laws and regulations, or other improper activities by any of our
employees, agents, or business partners could have a significant negative impact on our business and reputation. Such misconduct could
include payments to government officials, bribery, fraud, anti-kickback and false claims rules, competition, export and import compliance,
money laundering, data privacy, and lobbying and similar activities. The FCPA, the U.K. Bribery Act of 2010, the Brazil Clean Companies
Act, China’s Unfair Competition Law, India’s Prevention of Corruption Act, and similar anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws in other
jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose

of obtaining or retaining business. We operate in parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree. It is
possible that the controls that we undertake to facilitate lawful conduct, which include training, internal control policies, and other
safeguards to educate our employees and certain third parties, could be intentionally circumvented or become inadequate because of
changed conditions. As a result, we cannot assure that our controls will protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our
employees or agents. Any alleged or actual violations of these laws or regulations may subject us to government scrutiny, criminal, civil, or
administrative sanctions, stockholder lawsuits, reputational damage, and other liabilities. In some instances, we make self-disclosures to
relevant authorities who may pursue or decline to pursue enforcement proceedings against us. The costs associated with the investigation,
remediation, and potential notification of any violation to customers, regulators, and counterparties could be material. Any of the foregoing
could have a material adverse effect on our business results, cash flows, financial condition, or prospects.
Risks Relating to Technology and Intellectual Property
We may be unable to obtain, maintain, protect, or effectively enforce our IP rights.
We cannot assure that our means of obtaining,
maintaining, and enforcing our IP rights will be adequate to maintain a competitive advantage. The laws of many jurisdictions may not
protect our IP rights or provide an adequate forum to effectively address situations where our IP rights have been compromised.
Furthermore, protecting against the unauthorized use of proprietary technology is difficult and expensive and we may need to litigate with
third parties to enforce or defend patents issued to us and our other IP rights or to determine the enforceability and validity of our
proprietary rights or those of others. Determining whether an offering infringes, misappropriates, or otherwise violates a third party’s IP
rights involves complex legal and factual issues, and the outcome of this type of litigation is often uncertain and may not always be
consistent. An adverse determination in any such litigation could materially impair our IP rights and may have a negative impact on our
business
.
From time to time, we may receive notices from third parties alleging infringement, misappropriation, or violation of their IP rights. We are
also subject to lawsuits alleging infringement, misappropriation, or other violation of third-party IP rights. When such claims are asserted
against us (or to avoid such claims), we may sometimes seek to license the third party’s IP rights, which may be costly. We may be unable
to obtain necessary licenses on satisfactory terms, if at all. If we are unable to obtain an adequate license, we may be subject to lawsuits
seeking damages or an injunction against the manufacture, import, marketing, sale, or operation of certain of our offerings or against the
operation of part of our business as presently conducted. Any settlement payment or other compromise may have future repercussions on
our ability to defend and protect certain of our IP rights. We do not maintain insurance for claims or litigation involving the infringement,
misappropriation, or other violation of IP rights. Regardless of the merits or outcome, the resolution of any IP dispute could require
significant financial and management resources.
Adverse judicial rulings or our entry into any license or settlement agreement in connection with third-party claims could affect our ability to
compete on certain offerings and have a material adverse effect on our business results, cash flows, financial condition, or prospects. Our
agreements with our customers and other third parties typically include indemnification or other provisions under which we agree to
indemnify or otherwise be liable to them for losses suffered or incurred as a result of certain third-party IP claims. We may not always be
successful in limiting our liability with respect to such obligations and could become subject to large indemnity payments or damages claims
from contractual breach, which could harm our business results, cash flows, financial condition, or prospects. Furthermore, protecting
confidential information and trade secrets can be difficult and, even if a successful enforcement action is brought, such action may not be
effective in protecting our confidential information and trade secrets. Additionally, the increased sharing of our data with third parties as a
result of right to repair legislation could increase the risk of loss or damage to our confidential information and IP. If we cannot adequately
obtain, maintain, protect, or enforce our IP rights, our competitors may be able to compete more successfully against us, which could have
a material adverse effect on our business results, cash flows, financial condition, or prospects.
We may not receive protection for pending or future applications relating to IP rights owned by or licensed to us and the scope of protection
allowed under any issued IP rights may not be sufficiently broad to protect our products, services, solutions, and any associated
trademarks. Products sold by our competitors may infringe, misappropriate, or otherwise violate IP rights owned or licensed by us. Any
issued IP rights owned by or licensed to us may be challenged, invalidated, held unenforceable, or circumvented in litigation or other
proceedings, and these limited IP rights may not provide us with effective competitive advantages. Intellectual property rights may also be
unavailable, limited, unenforceable, or practically unenforceable in some countries, and some governments may require us to transfer our
IP rights to local entities to do business in their jurisdiction, either of which could make it easier for competitors to capture increased market
position. We may also incur substantial costs to protect ourselves in litigation or other proceedings involving the validity and enforceability
of our IP rights. If claims against us are successful, we could lose valuable IP rights. An unfavorable outcome in any such litigation could
have a material adverse effect on our business results, cash flows, financial condition, or prospects.
We do not own the GE trademark or logo, and any elimination of our rights to use specified trademarks granted to us under our
Trademark License Agreement with GE could have an adverse effect on our business results, cash flows, financial condition, or
prospects.
We do not own the GE trademark or logo, which we use in line with our Trademark License Agreement with GE and in
combination with the “Vernova” trademark that is owned by us. GE owns and controls the GE brand, and the integrity and strength of the
GE brand will depend in large part on the efforts and businesses of GE and other licensees of the GE brand and how the brand is used,
promoted, and protected by them, which will be largely outside of our control.
Furthermore, there are certain circumstances under which the Trademark License Agreement may be terminated. Termination of the
Trademark License Agreement would eliminate our rights to use the specified trademarks granted to us under this agreement and may
result in our having to negotiate a new or reinstated agreement with less favorable terms or cause us to lose our rights under the
Trademark License Agreement, which would require us to change our corporate name and undergo significant rebranding efforts. These
rebranding efforts may require significant resources and expenses and may affect our ability to attract and retain customers, all of which
could have an adverse effect on our business results, cash flows, financial condition, or prospects. We own the “Vernova” trademark and
have taken steps to protect it. We have filed trademark applications and have been issued registrations for this trademark around the world.
We cannot be certain that, notwithstanding the legal protections, others do not or will not infringe or misappropriate our IP rights in this
trademark.

Increased cybersecurity requirements, vulnerabilities, threats, and more sophisticated and targeted computer crimes pose a risk
to our systems, networks, products, solutions, services, and data, as well as our reputation, which could adversely affect our
business.
We manufacture and sell products that rely upon software and computer systems to operate properly and process and store
confidential information. Our products often are connected to, and reside within, our customers’ information technology (IT) infrastructures.
In some jurisdictions, we are expected to design our products to include appropriate cybersecurity protections, and regulatory authorities
review such protections when granting marketing authorizations. The measures we take to protect our products and IT systems from
unauthorized access may not be effective, particularly because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems
change frequently, increase in sophistication, and often are not recognized until launched against a target. These risks apply to our installed
base of products, products we currently sell, new products we will introduce in the future, and older technology that we no longer sell or
service but remains in use by customers.
Increased global cybersecurity vulnerabilities, threats, computer viruses, and more sophisticated and targeted cyber-related attacks, such
as ransomware, as well as cybersecurity failures resulting from human error and technological errors, pose a risk to our security. They also
pose a risk to the security of our customers', partners', suppliers', and third-party service providers' infrastructure, products, systems, and
networks and the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of our data and our customers’ data, as well as associated financial risks. As
attackers become more capable (including sophisticated state or state-affiliated actors), and as critical infrastructure increasingly becomes
digitized, the risks in this area continue to grow. A significant cyber-related attack, such as an attack on power grids or power plants, could
pose broader disruptions and adversely affect our business even if such an attack does not involve our products, solutions, services, or
systems. We have also observed an increase in third-party cyber incidents and ransomware attacks on our suppliers, service providers and
software providers, and our efforts to mitigate adverse effects on us if this trend continues may not be successful in the future. The large
number of suppliers that we work with requires significant effort for the initial and ongoing verification of their implementation of effective
cybersecurity requirements. The increasing degree of interconnectedness and shared liability between us and our partners, suppliers, and
customers also poses a risk to the security of our network as well as the larger ecosystem in which we operate. There can be no assurance
that our various cybersecurity measures - including employee training, monitoring and testing, performing security reviews and requiring
business partners with connections to our network to appropriately secure their IT systems, and maintaining protective systems and
contingency plans - will be sufficient to prevent, detect, and limit the impact of cyber-related attacks, and we remain vulnerable to known or
unknown threats. For example, we outsource certain cybersecurity functions and will continue to look for opportunities to utilize managed
security service providers.
In addition, we collaborate with GE Aerospace on certain cybersecurity functions and will continue to do so
during a transition period following our Spin-Off. These
arrangements will increase our overall cyber risk given the degree of our
interconnectedness with the provider and the potential impact on our outsourced functions that could be caused by an attack on such a
provider.
In addition to existing risks from the integration of digital technologies into our business portfolio, the adoption of new technologies in the
future may also increase our exposure to cybersecurity incidents and failures. An unknown vulnerability or compromise could potentially
impact the security of our software or connected products and lead to the misuse or unintended use of our products, loss of our IP,
misappropriation of sensitive, confidential or personal information, safety risks or unavailability of products.
We also have access to sensitive, confidential or personal information or information in our businesses that is subject to privacy and
security laws, regulations or customer-imposed controls. We have vulnerability to security incidents, theft, misplaced, lost or corrupted data,
programming errors, employee errors or malfeasance (including misappropriation by departing employees) that could potentially lead to the
material compromise of sensitive, confidential or personal information, improper use of our systems, software solutions or networks,
unauthorized access, use, disclosure, modification or destruction of or denial of access to information, defective products, production
downtimes, and operational disruptions.
Furthermore, we rely on software, hardware, and other material components from a number of third parties to manufacture our products. If
a material cyber incident impacting a supplier were to result in its prolonged inability to manufacture and/or ship such components, this
could impact our ability to manufacture our products. In addition, third-party sourced software components, malicious code, or a critical
vulnerability emerging within such software could expose our customers to increased cyber risk. If we were to experience a significant
cybersecurity incident impacting our information systems or data, the costs associated with the investigation, remediation, and potential
notification of the incident to customers, regulators, and counterparties could be material. Any such impact could result in financial or
reputational damage, as well as expose us to litigation and regulatory enforcement actions.
Failure to comply with evolving data privacy and data protection laws and regulations or to otherwise protect personal
information in the jurisdictions in which we operate, may adversely impact our business and financial results.
We have access to
sensitive, confidential, proprietary, or personal information (including employee information) in our businesses that is subject to a variety of
jurisdiction specific data privacy and security laws, regulations, standards, contractual obligations, or customer-imposed controls. The legal
and regulatory environment related to data privacy, data protection, and cyber security is increasingly complex and rigorous, with new and
constantly evolving requirements applicable to our business. This evolution is further complicated by the adoption of new technologies,
particularly generative
AI
, which raises novel privacy and security issues. Enforcement practices vary widely in the jurisdictions in which our
businesses operate and are likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future.
As a result of our worldwide operations, we are subject to rapidly shifting privacy and data protection laws and regulations. In the U.S.,
various federal and state regulators, including the Federal Trade Commission, have adopted, or are considering adopting, laws,
regulations, and standards concerning personal information, privacy, and data security. There are also U.S. state privacy laws that impose
privacy and security obligations on companies that collect and process personal information. These state laws, and similar state or federal
laws or regulations that may be enacted in the future, may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies and thus incur
substantial compliance-related expenses or otherwise suffer adverse impacts on our business. Internationally, many of the jurisdictions in
which we operate have adopted unique data privacy and cybersecurity legal frameworks with which we must comply. Violations of
applicable data privacy or data protection laws or regulations could result in substantial fines, regulatory investigations, reputational
damage, orders to cease processing or to change uses of data, sanctions, and enforcement notices, and raise the potential for civil claims
and proceedings, including class action litigation.
2024 FORM 10-K
26
International, federal, and state laws, regulations, and standards can differ significantly from one another and may be interpreted and
applied differently over time and from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. It is not uncommon for there to be a period of uncertainty over how to
practically apply the law, such as when there is a delay in regulators issuing supplementary guidance or implementing regulations to
provide clarity on their expectations. We are also observing an increase in jurisdictional specific requirements related to the cross-border
transfer of personal information, which can bring complexity to processing operations that are supported by external third parties located
globally. Given our global footprint, this complexity may significantly complicate our compliance efforts and impose considerable costs, such
as costs related to organizational changes, modification of our data processing practices and policies, implementation of additional
protection technologies, or consultation with third parties who have jurisdictional expertise. In addition, compliance with applicable
requirements may take time away from management of other issues and can divert resources from other initiatives and projects. Any failure
or perceived failure by us to comply with applicable international, federal, or state laws, regulations, standards, contractual obligations, or
customer-imposed controls relating to data privacy and security could adversely affect our business and result in damage to our reputation
and our relationship with our customers.
Risks Relating to Financial, Accounting, and Tax Matters
Volatility in currency exchange rates may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
As a
result of our global operations, we generate and incur a significant portion of our revenues and expenses in currencies other that the U.S.
d
ollar.
Our business is subject to foreign currency exchange rates fluctuations, particularly with respect to the Euro and the British pound
sterling.
Changes in the value of currencies of the countries in which we do business relative to the value of the U.S. dollar could affect our ability to
sell products competitively and control our cost structure, which could have an adverse effect on our business, cash flows, financial
condition, and results of operations. Additionally, we are subject to foreign exchange translation risk due to changes in the value of foreign
currencies in relation to our reporting currency, the U.S. dollar. As the U.S. dollar fluctuates against other currencies in which we transact
business, revenue and income can be impacted, including revenue decreases due to unfavorable foreign currency impacts. Strengthening
of the U.S. dollar relative to the euro and the currencies of the other countries in which we do business, could materially and adversely
affect our ability to compete in international markets and our sales growth in future periods. In addition, we may be unable to hedge the
effects of foreign exchange rate and interest rate changes in a cost-effective manner. For a discussion of the ways and extent to which we
attempt to mitigate the impact of foreign exchange risk, see Note 20 in the Notes to the consolidated and combined financial statements
and Item 7A. "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk." Any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our
business results, cash flows, financial condition, or prospects.
We may not be able to access the capital and credit markets on terms that are favorable to us, or at all, and we may be restricted
or delayed in accessing our cash held overseas.
Our business relies on the availability of financing for our products and services. The
capital and credit markets may experience extreme volatility or disruptions that may lead to uncertainty and liquidity issues for both
borrowers and investors. Certain customers and suppliers, as well as our business, may need access to credit and trade finance lines and
other financing instruments for certain transactions. We have a $3.0 billion committed credit facility and a $3.0 billion committed trade
finance facility, but there can be no assurance that these facilities will be sufficient to meet our future needs for such transactions.
Additionally, we may need to access the capital markets to supplement our existing funds and cash generated from operations to satisfy
our needs for example, for working capital or capital expenditure requirements. A variety of factors beyond our control could impact the
availability or cost of capital, including domestic or international economic conditions, increases in key benchmark interest rates and/or
credit spreads, the adoption of new or amended banking or capital market laws or regulations, and the repricing of market risks and
volatility in capital and financial markets. In the event of adverse capital and credit market conditions, we may be unable to obtain capital
market financing on favorable terms, or at all, and changes in credit ratings issued by nationally recognized credit-rating agencies could
adversely affect our ability to obtain capital market financing and the cost of such financing. Additionally, a large portion of our total
consolidated cash will be held overseas and may not be efficiently accessible to GE Vernova to finance or to otherwise support our capital
market requirements. Such factors may impact our ability, or the ability of our customers or suppliers, to obtain debt financing, guarantees,
or hedging from financial institutions which may negatively impact our business.
In addition, large energy projects may require co-financing of projects through project development loans, structured debt financing or
equity investments, including those done in collaboration with our Financial Services business. It is possible that such financing may not be
available, or that the cost may be higher than anticipated, negatively impacting our ability to bid for certain projects, or negatively impacting
our earnings, cash flows, and returns. The termination of, expiration of, or exhaustion of funding capacity or commitments available to us
under our Framework Investment Agreement with GE, our inability to maintain sufficient balance sheet capacity to make future tax equity
commitments, or an inability to generate sufficient U.S. tax base to allow us to monetize tax credits, could reduce our ability to make, or
prevent us from making at all, future such investments, which could further negatively impact our financial condition. Any of these risks
could have a material adverse effect on our business results, cash flows, financial condition, prospects, and the market price of our
securities.
Future material impairments in the value of our long-lived assets, including goodwill, could adversely affect our business.
We
review our long-lived assets, including identifiable intangible assets, goodwill, and property, plant, and equipment (PP&E), for impairment at
least annually. All long-lived assets are reviewed when there is an indication that impairment may have occurred. Changes in market
conditions or other changes in the outlook of value may lead to impairment charges in the future. In addition, we may sell assets that we
determine are not critical to our strategy. Future events or decisions may lead to asset impairments or related charges. Certain non-cash
impairments may result from a change in our strategic goals, business direction, or other factors relating to the overall business
environment. Material impairment charges could negatively affect our results of operations.
Changes in tax laws, tax rates, tariffs, adverse positions taken by taxing authorities, and tax audits could impact operating
results.
We are subject to income and other taxes (including sales, excise, and value-added) in the U.S. and numerous foreign
jurisdictions. The determination of the Company’s worldwide provision for income taxes and liability for income and other tax liabilities
requires judgment and is based on diverse legislative and regulatory structures that exist in the various jurisdictions where the Company
operates. These factors, together with changes in tax laws, tax rates, tariffs, changes in interpretation of tax laws, the resolution of tax
2024 FORM 10-K
27
assessments or audits by various tax authorities, and the ability to fully utilize tax loss carryforwards and tax credits, could impact our
operating results, including additional valuation allowances for deferred tax assets. Potential changes to tax laws, including changes to
taxation of global income, may have an effect on our subsidiaries structure, operations, sales, liquidity, cash flows, capital requirements,
effective tax rate and performance. For example, legislative or regulatory measures by U.S. federal, state or non-U.S. governments such as
newly adopted global minimum taxes or other changes to the treatment of global income could increase our cash tax costs and effective tax
rate. We are unable to predict what tax reforms may be proposed or enacted in the future or what effect such changes would have on our
business, but such changes could potentially result in higher tax expense and payments, along with increasing the complexity, burden, and
cost of compliance.
Our tax burden could increase as a result of ongoing or future tax audits.
We are subject to periodic tax audits by tax authorities. Tax
authorities may not agree with our interpretation of applicable tax laws and regulations. As a result, such tax authorities may assess
additional tax, interest, and penalties. We regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits and other tax disputes to determine the
appropriateness of our tax provision and establish reserves for material, known tax exposures. However, the calculation of such tax
exposures involves the application of complex tax laws and regulations in many jurisdictions. Therefore, there can be no assurance that we
will accurately predict the outcomes of any tax audit or other tax dispute or that issues raised by tax authorities will be resolved at a
financial cost that does not exceed our related reserves. As such, the actual outcomes of these disputes and other tax audits could have a
material impact on our financial results.
Our ability to use deferred tax assets may be subject to limitation.
We have deferred tax assets in certain countries and our ability to
use such assets will depend on taxable income generation in the relevant countries. Further, while the majority of these assets either do not
currently have an expiration date or have an expiration date that is later than when we expect to use such assets, subsequent changes to
applicable tax laws in these jurisdictions could impact our ability to fully benefit from the deferred tax assets.
Risks Relating to the Spin-Off
The Spin-Off could result in significant tax liability to GE and its stockholders if it is determined to be a taxable transaction.
GE
received a private letter ruling from the IRS to the effect that, among other things, the Spin-Off, qualifies as a transaction that is tax-free for
U.S. federal income tax purposes under Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Code. In connection with the completion of the Spin-Off, GE
received a written opinion from each of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP and Ernst & Young, LLP to the effect that the Spin-
Off qualifies for non-recognition of gain and loss under Section 355 and related provisions of the Code.
The opinion of counsel and the opinion of Ernst & Young, LLP did not address any U.S. state or local or foreign tax consequences of the
Spin-Off. Each opinion assumed that the Spin-Off would be completed according to the terms of the Separation and Distribution Agreement
and relies on the facts as stated in the Separation and Distribution Agreement, the Tax Matters Agreement, the other ancillary agreements,
the
Information Statemen
t and a number of other documents.
In addition, the opinion of counsel, the opinion of Ernst & Young, LLP, and the private letter ruling relied on certain facts, assumptions,
representations, and undertakings from GE and us regarding the past and future conduct of the companies’ respective businesses and
other matters. If any of these facts, assumptions, representations, or undertakings are incorrect or not otherwise satisfied, GE and its
stockholders may not be able to rely on the opinion of counsel, the opinion of Ernst & Young, LLP, or the private letter ruling and could be
subject to significant tax liabilities.
The opinion of counsel and the opinion of Ernst & Young, LLP will not be binding on the IRS or the courts, and there can be no assurance
that the IRS or a court will not take a contrary position. Notwithstanding the opinion of counsel, the opinion of Ernst & Young, LLP, or the
private letter ruling, the IRS could determine on audit that the Spin-Off or any of certain related transactions is taxable if it determines that
any of these facts, assumptions, representations, or undertakings are not correct or have been violated or if it disagrees with the
conclusions in the opinion that are not covered by the private letter ruling, or for other reasons, including as a result of certain significant
changes in the stock ownership of GE or us after the Spin-Off. If the conclusions expressed in the opinion of counsel or the opinion of Ernst
& Young, LLP are challenged by the IRS, and if the IRS prevails in such challenge, the tax consequences of the Spin-Off (including the tax
consequences to GE and the U.S. Holders (as defined in the Information Statement)) could be materially less favorable.
If the Spin-Off were determined not to qualify for non-recognition of gain or loss under Section 355 and related provisions of the Code, each
U.S. Holder who received our common stock in the Spin-Off would generally be treated as having received a distribution in an amount
equal to the fair market value of our common stock received, which would generally result in: (i) a taxable dividend to the U.S. Holder to the
extent of that U.S. Holder’s pro rata share of GE’s current or accumulated earnings and profits; (ii) a reduction in the U.S. Holder’s basis
(but not below zero) in GE common stock to the extent the amount received exceeds the stockholder’s share of GE’s earnings and profits;
and (iii) taxable gain from the exchange of GE common stock to the extent the amount received exceeds the sum of the U.S. Holder’s
share of GE’s earnings and profits and the U.S. Holder’s basis in its GE common stock. See “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax
Consequences of the Spin-Off” in the Information Statement.
If the Spin-Off were determined not to qualify as tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we could have an indemnification
obligation to GE, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations.
If, as a
result of any of our representations being untrue or our covenants being breached, the Spin-Off were determined not to qualify for non-
recognition of gain or loss under Section 355 and related provisions of the Code, we could be required by our Tax Matters Agreement with
GE to indemnify GE for the resulting taxes and related expenses. Those amounts could be material. Any such indemnification obligation
could adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations.
For example, if we or our stockholders were to engage in transactions that resulted in a 50% or greater change by vote or value in the
ownership of our stock during the four-year period beginning on the date that begins two years before the date of the Spin-Off, the Spin-Off
would generally be taxable to GE, but not to GE stockholders, under Section 355(e), unless it were established that such transactions and
the Spin-Off were not part of a plan or series of related transactions. If the Spin-Off were taxable to GE due to such a 50% or greater
change by vote or value in the ownership of our stock, GE would recognize gain equal to the excess of the fair market value on the April 2,
2024 FORM 10-K
28
2024 (Distribution Date) of our common stock distributed to GE stockholders over GE’s tax basis in our common stock, and we generally
would be required to indemnify GE for the tax on such gain and related expenses. Those amounts could be material. Any such
indemnification obligation could adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations. See “Certain
Relationships and Related Person Transactions— Agreements with GE—Tax Matters Agreement" in the Information Statement.
We agreed to numerous restrictions to preserve the non-recognition tax treatment of the Spin-Off, which may reduce our
strategic and operating flexibility.
To preserve the tax-free nature of the Spin-Off and related transactions, we agreed in the Tax Matters
Agreement to covenants and indemnification obligations that address compliance with Section 355 and related provisions of the Code, as
well as state, local and foreign tax law. These covenants include certain restrictions on our activity for a period of two years following the
Spin-Off. Specifically, we are subject to certain restrictions on our ability to enter into acquisition, merger, liquidation, sale, and stock
redemption transactions with respect to our stock or assets and we may be required to indemnify GE against any resulting tax liabilities
even if we do not participate in or otherwise facilitate the acquisition. Furthermore, we are subject to specific restrictions on discontinuing
the active conduct of our trade or business, the issuance or sale of stock or other securities (including securities convertible into our stock
but excluding certain compensatory arrangements), and sales of assets outside the ordinary course of business. These covenants and
indemnification obligations may limit our ability to pursue strategic transactions or engage in new businesses or other transactions that may
maximize the value of our business, and might discourage or delay a strategic transaction that our stockholders may consider favorable.
See “Certain Relationships and Related Person Transactions— Agreements with GE—Tax Matters Agreement” in the Information
Statement.
We may be unable to achieve some or all of the benefits that we expect to achieve from the Spin-Off.
We may be unable to achieve
the full strategic and financial benefits expected to result from the separation and distribution, or such benefits may be delayed or not occur
at all. We believe that, as an independent, publicly traded company, we are able to, among other things, more effectively focus on our own
distinct operating priorities and strategies, better address specific market dynamics and target innovation, create incentives for our
management and employees that align more closely with our business performance and the interests of our stockholders, achieve
operational simplification and cost savings, and articulate a clear investment proposition and tailored capital allocation policy to attract a
long-term investor base best suited to our business needs. We may be unable to achieve some or all of the benefits that we expect to
achieve as an independent company in the time we expect, if at all, for a variety of reasons, including: (i) compliance with the requirements
of being an independent, publicly traded company require significant amounts of our management’s time and effort, which may divert
management’s attention from operating and growing our business; (ii) we may be more susceptible to market fluctuations, actions by
activist stockholders, and other adverse events than if we were still a part of GE; (iii) our businesses are less diversified than GE’s
businesses prior to the separation; (iv) the actions required to separate GE’s and our respective businesses could disrupt our operations;
and (v) under the terms of the Tax Matters Agreement, we are restricted from taking certain actions that could cause the Spin-Off to fail to
qualify as a tax-free transaction and these restrictions may limit us for a period of time from pursuing strategic transactions and equity
issuances or engaging in other transactions that may increase the value of our business. If we fail to achieve some or all of the benefits that
we expect to achieve as an independent company, or do not achieve them in the time we expect, our business, financial condition, cash
flows, and results of operations could be adversely affected.
We could incur substantial additional costs and experience temporary business interruptions, and we may not be adequately
prepared to meet the requirements of an independent, publicly traded company on a timely or cost-effective basis.
Prior to the
Spin-Off, we operated as part of GE, and GE provided us with various corporate functions. Following the Spin-Off, GE does not provide us
with assistance other than the transition and other services described under “Certain Relationships and Related Person Transactions” in
the Information Statement. These services do not include every service that we received from GE in the past, and GE is only obligated to
provide the transition services for limited periods following completion of the Spin-Off. Following the cessation of any transition services
agreements, we need to provide internally or obtain from unaffiliated third parties the services we will no longer receive from GE. Although
we have made progress in providing and obtaining such services, we may be unable to replace all of these services in a timely manner or
on terms and conditions as favorable as those we receive from GE.
Since the Spin-Off, we have been installing and implementing IT infrastructure to support certain of our business functions, including
accounting and financial reporting, human resources, legal and compliance, communications, and indirect sourcing. We may incur
substantially higher costs than anticipated as we continue our transition from the existing transactional and operational systems and data
centers we used as part of GE. If we are unable to complete our transition effectively, we may incur temporary interruptions in business
operations. Any delay in implementing, or operational interruptions suffered while implementing, our new IT infrastructure could disrupt our
business and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
In addition, we are subject to reporting and other obligations under the Exchange Act. The Exchange Act requires that we file annual,
quarterly, and current reports with respect to our business and financial condition.
Beginning with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
year ended December 31, 2025, we will be required to conduct an
annual management assessment of the effectiveness of our internal
control over financial reporting and include a report by our independent registered public accounting firm on the effectiveness of internal
control over financial reporting. Under the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002, as amended (the Sarbanes Oxley Act), we are also required to
maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures. These reporting and other obligations may place significant demands on
management, administrative, and operational resources, including accounting systems and resources. If we fail to comply with financial
reporting requirements and other rules that apply to reporting companies under the Exchange Act, we may be unable to conclude that our
internal control over financial reporting is effective. If we are not able to comply with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley
Act in a timely manner, or if we or our independent registered public accounting firm identify deficiencies in our internal control over
financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses, the market price of shares of our common stock could decline and we could
be subject to sanctions or investigations by the SEC or other regulatory authorities, which would require additional financial and
management resources.
Moreover, we cannot be certain that these measures would ensure that we implement and maintain adequate controls over our financial
processes and reporting in the future. Even if we were to conclude, and our auditors were to concur, that our internal control over financial
reporting provided reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for
external purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP, because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting might not
2024 FORM 10-K

prevent or detect fraud or misstatements. This, in turn, could have an adverse impact on trading prices for shares of our common stock,
and could adversely affect our ability to access the capital markets.
We have limited operating history as an independent, publicly traded company, and our historical combined financial information
is not necessarily representative of the results we would have achieved as an independent, publicly traded company and may not
be a reliable indicator of our future results.
We derived the historical combined financial information for 2022 and 2023 included in this
Annual Report on Form 10-K from GE’s consolidated financial statements, and this information does not necessarily reflect the results of
operations, cash flows, and financial position we would have achieved as an independent, publicly traded company during the periods
presented, or those that we will achieve in the future. This is primarily because of the following factors:
•
Prior to the Spin-Off, we operated as part of GE, and GE performed various corporate functions for us. Our historical combined
financial information for 2022 and 2023 reflects allocations of corporate expenses from GE for these functions. These allocations
may not reflect the costs we have incurred or will incur for similar services as an independent, publicly traded company.
•
The agreements and transactions we entered into with GE in connection with the Spin-Off, such as GE’s provision of transition
and other services and indemnification obligations, have caused and will continue to cause us to incur new costs. See “Certain
Relationships and Related Person Transactions—Agreements with GE” in the Information Statement.
•
Our historical combined financial information for 2022 and 2023 does not reflect changes that we have experienced and that we
expect to continue to experience as a result of our separation from GE, including changes in the financing, cash management,
operations, cost structure, and personnel needs of our business. As part of GE, we enjoyed certain benefits from GE’s operating
diversity, reputation, size, purchasing power, ability to borrow, and available capital for investments; following the Spin-Off, we no
longer have those benefits.
Following the Spin-Off, we have incurred and will continue to incur additional costs and demands on management’s time associated with
being an independent, publicly traded company, including costs and demands related to corporate governance, investor and public
relations, and public financial reporting. Our success depends on our ability to continue to integrate our businesses that operate in various
aspects of the power industry, which historically operated separately into one cohesive company. In addition, we depend on the successful
cooperation of our leadership team, who have limited experience leading our business. For additional information about our past financial
performance and the basis of presentation of our combined financial statements,
see “
Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined
Financial Statements" in the Information Statement and the
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations,” and our combined and consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in the Information Statement and in
this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Certain of our directors and employees may have actual or potential conflicts of interest because of their financial interests in, or
because of their previous or continuing positions with, GE or other entities with which we have commercial arrangements.
Because of their current or former positions with GE, certain of our executive officers and directors own equity interests in both us and GE.
Continuing ownership of GE shares and equity awards could create, or appear to create, potential conflicts of interest if we and GE face
decisions that could have implications for both us and GE. Our
Board
chair
currently also serves on the board of directors of GE. Potential
conflicts of interest could arise in connection with the resolution of any dispute between us and GE regarding the terms of the agreements
governing the separation and distribution and our relationship with GE following the separation and distribution. See “Certain Relationships
and Related Person Transactions” in the Information Statement for information about some of these agreements. Potential conflicts of
interest may also arise out of any commercial arrangements that we or GE may enter into in the future. In addition, some of our
independent directors serve on boards or management of companies with which we have commercial relationships, including investors.
Similar potential conflicts of interest could arise as a result. A dispute regarding a potential or actual conflict of interest involving us and GE
or any of such other companies could negatively impact our businesses, results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition. In
addition, public perception of such an actual or apparent conflict of interest could pose reputational risks and expose us to increased
scrutiny from investors and regulators. Although we have policies governing conflicts of interest, they may not sufficiently protect against
these risks.
Our written code of conduct applies to our directors and executive officers, as well as employees, and intends to promote honest and
ethical conduct, including the handling of actual or apparent conflicts of interests between personal and professional relationships. Our
governance principles assist with governance practices, including a requirement that directors disclose actual or potential conflicts of
interest and recuse themselves from any discussion or decision affecting their personal, business, or professional interests. The
governance principles also delegate the resolution of any conflict of interest question involving a director or an executive officer to the
Nominating and Governance Committee and the resolution of any conflict of interest issue involving any other officer of the Company to the
CEO. In addition, each of our officers and directors have confirmed their ongoing obligation to notify management of their outside activities,
which enables management to monitor future potential conflicts of interest, whether with GE or other third parties.
We may not be able to arrange for the termination or replacement of, and the release of GE and its subsidiaries from, the
remaining parent company credit support obligations.
To support GE Vernova in selling products and services globally, prior to the
Spin-Off, GE entered into contracts on behalf of GE Vernova or issued parent company guarantees or trade finance instruments supporting
the performance of what are subsidiary legal entities transacting directly with customers of GE Vernova, in addition to having provided
similar credit support for some non-customer related activities of GE Vernova (collectively, “GE credit support”), which is further described
in "Certain Relationships and Related Person Transactions— Agreements with GE—Separation and Distribution Agreement—Credit
Support” section in the Information Statement. The Separation and Distribution Agreement requires us to use reasonable best efforts to
arrange for the termination or replacement of, and the release of GE and its subsidiaries from, all GE credit support. See Item 7.
"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Capital Resources and Liquidity—Parent
Company Credit Support" for information about the amounts of the parent
company guarantees.
For the obligations that remain outstanding
under GE credit support, we are required to indemnify GE against any amounts paid in connection with such GE credit support. Pursuant to
the Separation and Distribution Agreement, we are subject to certain restrictions and covenants with respect to contracts underlying GE
credit support under which GE or its subsidiaries remain liable, including a prohibition on certain amendments and on any disposition of
such contracts (including indirectly through dispositions of our subsidiaries). These provisions may restrict us from extending contracts, or
amending contracts in a manner which increases GE’s obligations under, outstanding GE credit support, or require us to obtain third-party
2024 FORM 10-K
30
credit support with respect to such obligations. In each case, these provisions could delay or prevent the accomplishment of our objectives
and adversely affect our business. In addition, so long as obligations remain outstanding under GE credit support, unless GE otherwise
consents, it will be a condition to any acquisition or change of control of GE Vernova that the acquiring person have the financial and
operational capacity to satisfy those obligations, have unsecured investment grade ratings, and agree to be bound by all the same
provisions applicable to us under the Separation and Distribution Agreement with respect to the GE credit support, or we, or such acquiring
person will be required to provide third-party credit support reasonably acceptable to GE with respect to such GE credit support. This
condition may discourage, delay, or prevent certain types of transactions involving an actual or a threatened acquisition, or change in
control of GE Vernova, including unsolicited takeover attempts, even though the transaction may offer our stockholders the opportunity to
sell their shares of our common stock at a price above the prevailing market price. For more information on our obligations pertaining to the
GE credit support, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity—Parent
Company Credit Support” and “Certain Relationships and Related Person Transactions—Separation and Distribution Agreement—Credit
Support” in the Information Statement.
We or GE may fail to perform under various transaction agreements that were executed as part of the separation.
In connection
with the separation, we and GE entered into various transaction agreements related to the Spin-Off. All of these agreements govern our
relationship with GE . We rely on GE to satisfy its performance obligations under these agreements. If we or GE are unable to satisfy our or
its respective obligations under these agreements, including indemnification obligations, our business, results of operations, cash flows,
and financial condition could be adversely affected. See “Certain Relationships and Related Person Transactions” in the Information
Statement.
Certain non-U.S. entities or assets that are part of our separation from GE were not transferred to us prior to the Spin-Off and
may not be at all.
Certain non-U.S. entities and assets that were part of our separation from GE were not transferred prior to the Spin-Off
because the entities or assets, as applicable, were subject to foreign government or third-party approvals that we did not receive prior to
the Spin-Off. Such approvals included, but are not limited to, approvals to merge or separate, to form new legal entities (including obtaining
required registrations and/or licenses or permits), and to transfer assets and/or liabilities. Although most material transfers occurred without
delays beyond the Distribution Date, we cannot offer any assurance that such transfers will ultimately occur or not be delayed for an
extended period of time. Under the Separation and Distribution Agreement, the economic consequences of owning such assets and/or
entities are, to the extent reasonably possible and permitted by applicable law, provided to us. In the event such transfers do not ultimately
occur or are significantly delayed because we do not receive the required approvals, we may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of our
separation from GE and we may be dependent on GE for transition services for a longer period of time than would otherwise be the case.
Transfer or assignment to us of some contracts, joint ventures, and other assets required the consent of a third party. If such
consent is not given or if its requirement is used to obtain more favorable contractual terms, we may not be entitled to some or
all of the benefit of such contracts, joint ventures, investments, and other assets in the future.
Transfer or assignment of some of
the contracts, joint ventures, and other assets in connection with the Spin-Off and change of control in the ownership structure following the
Spin-Off required the consent of a third party to the transfer or assignment. Similarly, in some circumstances, we are joint beneficiaries of
contracts, and we need to enter into a new agreement with the third party to replicate the existing contract or assign the portion of the
existing contract related to our business. While we endeavored to cause these contract and joint ventures transfers, assignments,
consents, and new agreements to be obtained prior to the Spin-Off, we were not able to obtain all required consents, or enter into all such
agreements, as applicable. Some parties may use the requirement of a consent to seek more favorable contractual terms from us, which
could require us to accept a lower economic benefit from the contract or joint venture, or include our having to obtain letters of credit or
other forms of credit support. If we are unable to obtain such consents or such credit support on commercially reasonable and satisfactory
terms, we may be unable to obtain some of the benefits, assets, and contractual commitments that are intended to be allocated to us as
part of the Spin-Off. In addition, where we do not intend to seek consent from third-party counterparties based on our understanding that no
consent is required, the third-party counterparties may challenge the transaction on the basis that the terms of the applicable commercial
arrangements require their consent. We may incur substantial litigation and other costs in connection with any such claims and, if we do not
prevail, our ability to use these assets could be adversely impacted.
We cannot provide assurance that all such required third-party consents and agreements will be procured or put in place. Consequently, we
may not realize certain of the benefits that are intended to be allocated to us as part of the Spin-Off.
Risks Relating to Our Common Stock and the Securities Market
Our stock price may fluctuate significantly.
The market price of our common stock may fluctuate widely depending on many factors,
some of which may be beyond our control. The nature of our business and industry subject us, and our stock price,
to
volatility
.
Should the
market price of our shares drop significantly, stockholders may institute securities class action lawsuits against us. A lawsuit against us
could cause us to incur substantial costs and could divert the time and attention of our management and other resources.
We may not achieve our target for returning our cash generation to our stockholders and the amounts we do return may be less
than planned.
In December 2024, we announced our plan to return at least one-third of our cash generation to our stockholders. In
connection with that plan, our Board initiated a quarterly cash dividend of $0.25 per share of our common stock, which we paid in January
2025, and a share repurchase authorization of up to $6 billion. Our ability to return cash to our stockholders will depend on our earnings,
financial condition, cash requirements, other potential cash uses, prospects, and other factors. Further, the price, availability, and trading
volumes of our common stock will affect the timing and size of any share repurchases. As a result, we may not achieve our targeted level
for returning cash generation to our stockholders and any amounts we do return may be less than planned.
Holders of our common stock may be diluted due to equity issuances.
In the future, holders of our common stock may be diluted
because of equity issuances for acquisitions, capital market transactions, or otherwise, including any equity awards that we will grant to our
directors, officers, and employees. We award our directors, officers, certain of our employees and others with stock-based awards as part
of our ongoing equity compensation program, and some of those persons also received stock-based awards from GE prior to the Spin-Off
that converted to our stock-based awards. Such awards will have a dilutive effect on our earnings per share, which could adversely affect
the market price of our common stock. We have and plan to issue additional stock-based awards, including annual awards, new hire
2024 FORM 10-K
31
awards, and periodic retention awards, as applicable, to our directors, officers, and other employees under our employee benefits plans as
part of our ongoing equity compensation program.
Certain provisions in our certificate of incorporation, bylaws, the Separation and Distribution Agreement, and Delaware law may
discourage takeovers and limit the power of our stockholders.
Several provisions of our certificate of incorporation, bylaws, the
Separation and Distribution Agreement, and Delaware law may discourage, delay, or prevent a merger or acquisition. These include,
among others, provisions that (i) classify our board of directors until 2029 whereby not all members are elected at one time, which could
delay the ability of stockholders to change the membership of a majority of our board of directors; (ii) provide for the removal of directors
only for cause during the time the Board is classified; (iii) establish advance notice requirements for stockholder nominations and
proposals; (iv) limit the ability of stockholders to call special meetings or act by written consent; (v) provide the Board the right to issue
shares of preferred stock without stockholder approval; and (vi) provide for the ability of our directors, and not stockholders, to fill vacancies
on the Board (including those resulting from an enlargement of the Board). We are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General
Corporation Law (DGCL), which could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control that
our stockholders
may favor. In
addition, we are subject to the restrictions on change of control transactions under the Separation and Distribution Agreement described
under “Certain Relationships and Related Person Transactions—Agreements with GE—Separation and Distribution Agreement—Credit
Support” in the Information Statement.
These and other provisions of our certificate of incorporation, bylaws, the Separation and Distribution Agreement, and Delaware law, as
well as the restrictions in our Tax Matters Agreement (see “Certain Relationships and Related Person Transactions—Agreements with GE
—Tax Matters Agreement” in the Information Statement), may discourage, delay, or prevent certain types of transactions involving an actual
or a threatened acquisition or change in control of GE Vernova, including unsolicited takeover attempts, even though the transaction may
offer our stockholders the opportunity to sell their shares of our common stock at a price above the prevailing market price. Our Board
believes these provisions will protect our stockholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics by requiring potential acquirers to
negotiate with the Board and by providing the Board with more time to assess any acquisition proposal.
Our certificate of incorporation provides that certain courts in the State of Delaware or the federal district courts of the U.S. will
be the sole and exclusive forum for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our
stockholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or employees.
Our
certificate of incorporation provides that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery located
within the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, any action
asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any current or former director, officer, employee, agent, or stockholder to us or our
stockholders, any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to the DGCL, the certificate of incorporation or the bylaws, or any action
asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine. However, if the Court of Chancery within the State of Delaware lacks jurisdiction
over such action, the action may be brought in another court of the State of Delaware or, if no court of the State of Delaware has
jurisdiction, then in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware. Additionally, our certificate of incorporation states that the foregoing
provision will not apply to claims arising under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (Securities Act). Unless we consent in writing to the
selection of an alternative forum, the federal district courts of the United States of America shall be the exclusive forum for the resolution of
any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act. The exclusive forum provisions will be applicable to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable law, subject to certain exceptions. Section 27 of the Exchange Act creates exclusive federal jurisdiction over
all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or the rules and regulations thereunder. As a result, the
exclusive forum provisions will not apply to suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or any other claim for
which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction. There is, however, uncertainty as to whether a court would enforce the exclusive forum
provisions, and investors cannot waive compliance with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder. Furthermore,
Section 22 of the Securities Act creates concurrent jurisdiction for state and federal courts over all suits brought to enforce any duty or
liability created by the Securities Act or the rules and regulations thereunder.
Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our capital stock will be deemed to have notice of and, to
the fullest extent permitted by law, to have consented to the provisions of our certificate of incorporation described above. The choice of
forum provision may result in increased costs for investors to bring a claim. Further, the choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder’s
ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers, other employees, or
stockholders, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers, other employees, or stockholders. However, the
enforceability of similar forum provisions in other companies’ certificates of incorporation has been challenged in legal proceedings. If a
court were to find the exclusive choice of forum provision contained in our certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in
an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions.
ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS.
None.
ITEM 1C.
CYBERSECURITY
.
The description in this section addresses certain cybersecurity matters relating to GE Vernova following
the Spin-Off.
GE Vernova has processes for assessing, identifying, and managing cybersecurity risks that are
built into our risk management program
and IT functions
. These processes are designed to help protect our information assets from internal and external cyber threats, protect
employee information from unauthorized access or attack, and secure our networks, systems, and products. We have developed and
implemented a cybersecurity framework intended to assess, identify, and manage risks from threats to the security of our information,
systems, products, and networks using a risk-based approach.
The framework is informed in part by industry standards such as the
National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework and International Organization for Standardization 27001
(ISO 27001) Framework. This approach does not imply that GE Vernova meets all technical standards, specifications, or requirements
under the NIST Cybersecurity Framework or ISO 27001.
2024 FORM 10-K
32
Our key cybersecurity processes include:
•
Risk-based controls for information systems and information on our network.
We seek to maintain an IT infrastructure that
implements physical, administrative, and technical controls that are calibrated based on risk and designed to protect the
confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our information systems and information stored on the Company’s networks, including
customer information, employee information, IP, and proprietary information.
•
Cybersecurity incident response plan and testing.
We have a cybersecurity incident response plan and a dedicated team to
respond to cybersecurity incidents. When a cybersecurity incident occurs or a vulnerability is identified, GE Vernova has cross-
functional teams that are responsible for leading the initial assessment of priority and severity. External experts may also be
engaged as appropriate. GE Vernova’s cybersecurity team assists in responding to incidents depending on severity levels and
seeks to improve our cybersecurity incident management plan through periodic tabletops or simulations at the enterprise and
business levels.
•
Training.
We provide security awareness training to help employees understand their information protection and cybersecurity
responsibilities. We also provide additional role-based training to applicable employees based on customer requirements,
regulatory obligations, and industry risks.
•
Supplier risk assessments.
We have implemented a
third-party risk management process
that includes expectations regarding
information protection and cybersecurity. That process, among other things, provides for GE Vernova to perform cybersecurity
assessments on certain suppliers based on their risk profile and a related rating process. GE Vernova also seeks contractual
commitments from key suppliers to appropriately secure and maintain their IT systems and protect our information that is
processed on their systems.
•
Third-party assessments.
We have third-party cybersecurity companies engaged to periodically assess GE Vernova’s
cybersecurity posture and assist in identifying and remediating risks from cybersecurity threats.
GE Vernova considers cybersecurity, along with other top risks, within our enterprise risk management framework. The enterprise risk
management framework includes internal reporting at the enterprise level with consideration of key risk indicators, trends, and
countermeasures for cybersecurity and other types of significant risks.
GE Vernova does not believe that there are currently any known
incidents from cybersecurity threats that are reasonably likely to materially affect GE Vernova or its business strategy, results of operations,
or financial condition
. As is the case for all large, global companies, we face certain ongoing risks from cybersecurity threats that, if
realized, are reasonably likely to materially affect the Company, including our operations, business strategy, results of operations, or
financial condition. See Item 1A. "Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Technology and Intellectual Property" for further information about these
risks. We outsource certain cybersecurity functions and will continue to look for opportunities to utilize managed security service providers.
In addition, we collaborate with GE Aerospace on certain cybersecurity functions and will continue to do so during a transition period
following our Spin-Off. These arrangements increase our overall cyber risk given the degree of our interconnectedness with these third
parties and the potential impact on our outsourced functions that could be caused by an attack on them.
The Audit Committee of the GE Vernova’s Board of Directors is responsible for board-level oversight of cybersecurity risk, and the Audit
Committee reports back to the full Board about this and other areas within its responsibility
.
As part of its oversight role, the Audit
Committee receives reporting about GE Vernova’s practices, programs, notable threats or incidents, and other developments related to
cybersecurity throughout the year, including through periodic updates from our
Chief Information Security Officer (CISO)
. The Audit
Committee also receives information about cybersecurity risks as part of GE Vernova’s enterprise risk management framework and
reporting. In addition to receiving reports from the Audit Committee, the Board also periodically receives direct reports from the CISO on the
Company's cybersecurity risk management.
GE Vernova’s CISO reports to GE Vernova’s Chief Information Officer and leads our overall cybersecurity function
.
The CISO has over 20
years of experience in managing and leading IT or cybersecurity teams and participates in various cyber security organizations.
The CISO
collaborates with business unit CISOs to identify and analyze cybersecurity risks to GE Vernova; consider industry trends; implement
controls, as appropriate and feasible, to mitigate these risks; and enable business leaders to make risk-based business decisions that
implicate cybersecurity considerations.
The CISO meets with senior leadership
to review and discuss GE Vernova’s cybersecurity program,
including emerging cyber risks, threats, and industry trends. The CISO also supervises efforts to prevent, detect, mitigate, and remediate
cybersecurity risks and incidents through various means, including by collaborating with internal security personnel and business
stakeholders, and incorporating threat intelligence and other information obtained from governmental, public, or private sources to inform
our cybersecurity technologies and processes.
ITEM 2. PROPERTIES.
GE Vernova is headquartered in Cambridge, Massachusetts and occupies approximately 600 sites in 465 cities
and 95 countries. Approximately 85% of the sites are leased and 15% are owned. GE Vernova periodically reviews the portfolio of facilities
for opportunities to optimize and best align our footprint needs.
Within this portfolio of properties, GE Vernova's subsidiaries operate 91 manufacturing sites, 18 of which are located in the U.S. and 73 are
located internationally. The manufacturing facilities are used by GE Vernova's segments as follows:
2024 FORM 10-K
33
The locations of GE Vernova's manufacturing locations by geographic region are as follows:
In addition to the manufacturing facilities described above, GE Vernova maintains many offices, warehouses, and distribution facilities
globally.
Many of our facilities serve several of our businesses and may be used for multiple purposes, such as for administration, sales, research,
laboratory matters, manufacturing, and service operations. We consider our facilities suitable and adequate for their respective purposes
and do not anticipate difficulty in renewing existing leases as they expire or finding alternative facilities if necessary.
ITEM 3. LEGAL
PROCEEDINGS
.
We are reporting the following matter in compliance with SEC requirements to disclose
administrative proceedings arising under laws that regulate the discharge of materials into the environment where a governmental authority
is a party and that involve potential monetary sanctions of $
300,00
0 or greater. In March 2024, one of our Australian subsidiaries received
notice from the Australian Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water (DCCEEW) of its intention to issue
infringement notices imposing administrative fines on the subsidiary for importing equipment containing SF6 gas without an equipment
license, as required by local law related to synthetic greenhouse gas management and seek a court order to impose civil penalties for
delinquent reporting under such law. The applicable local law regulates the import to Australia of synthetic greenhouse gases in equipment,
including certain of our switchgear products, and our subsidiary had neglected to renew the import license required under the law. We
responded to DCCEEW, and following discussions with the agency, paid approximately $0.3 million in fines in connection with the
infringement notices during the three months ended June 30, 2024. Discussions with DCCEEW regarding a court-issued civil penalty order
are pending and we expect additional fines and related costs associated with such order may be more than $300,000. See Note
22
in the
Notes to the consolidated and combined financial statements for additional information relating to legal matters.

PART II
ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANT'S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS, AND ISSUER
PURCHASES OF EQUITY
SECURITIES.
GE Vernova common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol "GEV." As of January 15, 2025, there were
approximately 175,000 stockholders of record.
The annual changes for the four-quarter period shown in the above graph are based on the assumption that $100 had been invested in GE
Vernova common stock, the Standard & Poor’s 500 Stock Index (S&P 500) and the Standard & Poor’s 500 Industrials Stock Index (S&P
Industrial) on A
pril 2, 20
24, and that all quarterly dividends were reinvested.
On
April 2, 2024
, the Company began trading as an
independent, publicly traded company under the stock symbol “GEV” on the New York Stock Exchange.
The cumulative dollar returns
shown on the graph represent the value that such investments would have had
on the date indi
cated.
On December 10, 2024, the Board of Directors declared a $0.25 per share quarterly dividend on the outstanding common stock of the
Company,
which we paid
on January 28, 2025 to stockholders of record as of December 20, 2024. The Company currently expects
quarterly dividends to continue in future periods, although they remain subject to determination and declaration by the Board of Directors.
The payment of future dividends, if any, will be based on several factors, including the Company’s financial performance, outlook and
liquidity.
PURCHASES
OF EQUITY SECURITIES BY THE ISSUER AND AFFILIATED PURCHASERS.
On
December 10, 2024
, we
announced that the Board of Directors had authorized up to $6 billion of common stock repurchases. We repurchased 8 thousand shares
for
$3 million during the three months ended
December 31, 2024
under this authorization
.
ITEM 6. [RESERVED].
ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS.
The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction
with our consolidated and combined financial statements, which are prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles (GAAP), and corresponding notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following discussion and analysis
provides information that management believes to be relevant to understanding the financial condition and results of operations of the
Company for the
years ended
December 31, 2024
and
2023
. Unless otherwise noted, tables are presented in U.S. dollars in millions,
except for per-share amounts which are presented in U.S. dollars. Certain columns and rows within tables may not add due to the use of
rounded numbers. Percentages presented in this report are calculated from the underlying numbers in millions. Unless otherwise noted,
statements related to changes in operating results relate to the corresponding period in the prior year.
Refer to the "Management's
2024 FORM 10-K
35
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" included in the
Information
Statement
for
discussions
of results
for the years ended December 31, 2023 versus 2022.
In the accompanying analysis of financial information, we sometimes use information derived from consolidated and combined financial
data but not presented in our financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Certain of these data are considered “non-GAAP
financial measures” under SEC rules. For the reasons we use these non-GAAP financial measures and the reconciliations to their most
directly comparable GAAP financial measures, see "
—
Non-GAAP Financial Measures."
TRENDS AND FACTORS IMPACTING OUR PERFORMANCE.
We believe our performance and future success depends on a
number of factors that present significant opportunities for us but also pose risks and challenges, including those discussed below and in
Item 1A. "Risk Factors."
Our worldwide operations are affected by regional and global factors impacting energy demand, including industry trends like
decarbonization, an increasing demand for r
enewable
energy alternatives, and changes in broader economic and geopolitical conditions
.
These trends, along with the growing focus on the digitization and sustainability of the electricity infrastructure, drive growth across each of
our business segments. We believe that our industry-defining technologies and commitment to innovation position us well to capitalize on
these long-term trends:
•
Demand growth for electricity generation
– Significant investment, infrastructure, and supply diversity will be essential to help meet
forecasted energy demand growth arising from population and global economic growth.
•
Decarbonization
– The urgency to combat climate change is fueling technology advancements that improve the economic viability and
efficiency of r
enewable
energy alternatives and facilitate the transition to a more sustainable power sector.
•
Evolving generation mix
– The power industry is shifting from coal generation to more electricity generated from zero- or low-carbon
energy sources, and an evolving balance of generation sources will be necessary to maintain a reliable, resilient and affordable
system.
•
Energy resilience & security
– Threats and challenges from extreme weather events, cyber-attacks, and geopolitical tensions have
increased focus on the strength and resilience of power generation and transmission and reinforced the need for a diversified mix of
energy sources.
•
Grid modernization and investment
– Increased demand and the integration of advanced generation and storage solutions drive the
need to update aging infrastructure with new grid integration and automation solutions.
•
Regulatory and policy changes
– Government policies and regulations, such as carbon pricing, renewable energy mandates, and
subsidies for renewable energy technologies, can significantly impact the power generation landscape. Staying ahead of regulatory
changes and adapting to new compliance requirements is crucial for maintaining a competitive advantage.
•
Financial and investment dynamics
– Access to capital and investment trends in the energy sector can influence the development and
deployment of new power generation projects. Understanding market dynamics and securing funding are key to progressing strategic
initiatives.
TRANSITION TO STAND-ALONE
CO
MPANY
Financial Presentation Under GE Ownership.
We completed our separation from
General Electric Company (GE)
, which now operates
as GE Aerospace, on April 2, 2024 (the Spin-Off). In connection with the Spin-Off, GE distrib
ute
d all of the shares of our common stock to
its stockholders and we became an independent company.
Historically, as a business of GE, we relied on GE to manage certain of our
operations and provide certain services, the costs of which were either allocated or directly billed to us. Accordingly, our historical costs for
such services may not necessarily reflect the actual expenses we would have incurred, or will incur, as an independent company and may
not reflect our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows had we been a separate, stand-alone company during the historical
periods presented.
See Note
1
in the Notes to the consolidated and combined financial statements for further information
.
Stand-Alone Company Expenses.
As a result of the Spin-Off, we are subject to the requirements of the federal and state securities laws
and stock exchange requirements. We have
established
additional procedures and practices as a stand-alone public company. As a result,
we
are incurring
additional costs related to external reporting, internal audit, treasury, investor relations, corporate governance, and stock
administration.
Production Tax Credit
Investments.
Our Financial Services business offers a wide range of financial solutions to customers and projects
that utilize our Power and Wind products and services. These solutions historically included making minority investments in projects, often
through common or preferred equity investments where we generally seek to exit as soon as practicable once a project achieves
commercial operation. Many such investments are in renewable energy U.S. tax equity vehicles that generate various tax credits, including
production tax credits (PTCs), which can be used to offset an equity partner’s tax liabilities in the U.S. and support the overall target return
on investment. In connection with the Spin-Off, GE retained all renewable energy U.S. tax equity investments of
$1.2 billion
and any tax
attributes from historical tax equity investing activity. We manage these investments under the Framework Investment Agreement with GE.
Additionally,
during the second quarter, in connection with GE retaining the renewable energy U.S. tax equity investments, we recognized a
$0.1 billion
benefit, recorded in Cost of equipment, related to deferred intercompany profit from historical equipment sales to the related
investees. See Notes

,
21
and

in the Notes to the consolidated and combined financial statements for further information.
DISPOSITION ACTIVITY
.
During the second quarter of 2024, our Steam Power business completed the sale of part of its nuclear
activities to Electricité de France S.A. (EDF). In connection with the disposition, we received net cash proceeds of
$0.6 billion
, which is
s
ubject to customary working capital and other post-closing adjustments
. As a
result, we recog
nized a pre-tax gain of
$1.0 billion
recorded
in Other income (expense) – net in our Consolidated and Combined Statement of Income (Loss). See Not
es

,

,

and

in
the Notes
to the consolidated and combined financial statements for further information.
ARBITRATION REFUND
.
In June 2024, we received
$306 million
in cash, which represented the return of cash payments we
previously made relating to two partial withdrawal liability assessments issued by a multiemployer pension plan (Fund) to which we
contribute, plus interest on such amounts. We challenged the assessments in arbitration, but under ERISA, we were required to make
2024 FORM 10-K
36
monthly payments from May 2019 to September 2023 while the matter was arbitrated. In December 2023, an arbitrator ruled that we were
exempt from the alleged liability, a decision that was appealed in January 2024 in a U.S. district court. That court upheld the arbitration
ruling in February 2025. The appeal period for that court's ruling has not expired. The arbitration ruling triggered a legal obligation for the
Fund to return the payments to us with interest, which it did in June 2024. During the second quarter,
$254 million
of cash, constituting the
payments previously made to the Fund, was recorded in Selling, general, and administrative expenses and
$52 million
of cash, constituting
interest on such amounts, was recorded in Interest and other financial charges – net in our Consolidated and Combined Statement of
Income (Loss). As this dispute is not yet resolved, we cannot predict its ultimate resolution, including whether we will retain the funds
following all final appeals, whether we are entitled to additional interest, or whether the Fund may contend it is owed interest if it prevails.
OFFSH
ORE
WIND.
On July 13, 2024, a wind turbine blade event occurred, related to a manufacturing deviation, at the Vineyard Wind
offshore wind farm where we are the manufacturer and supplier of our newly developed Haliade-X 220m wind turbines (Haliade-X). On July
15, 2024,
BSEE
issued a suspension order to cease power production and the installation of new wind turbines at the project site. On
August 10, 2024, BSEE issued a superseding order allowing us to resume the installation of towers and nacelles, subject to certain
conditions. On October 22, 2024, BSEE issued another superseding order allowing us to resume the installation of new blades, subject to
certain conditions. In December, the first new blade set was installed, and commercial power production by that turbine commenced. On
January 17, 2025, BSEE terminated its suspension order. Going forward, the installation of new blades and the production of power are
subject to specified conditions and we will be required to remove blades previously installed. In addition to the blade event at the Vineyard
Wind offshore wind farm, there have been blade events in prior quarters related to commissioning and installation at the Dogger Bank
offshore wind farm.
As we work through these issues, we are gaining experience across our Haliade-X backlog related to installation timelines, including vessel
availability, manufacturing and quality control processes, and various other project activities. Based on this experience, we are developing
and implementing our remediation plans, which includes updates to our project timelines to account for the slower pace of execution.
As a result of the above, we recorded incremental contract losses of approximately $0.9 billion in the third and fourth quarters for both
projects which include the estimated impact of changes in execution timelines, project-related commercial liabilities, costs to remediate
quality issues including the removal of previously installed blades at the Vineyard Wind project, and additional project-related supply chain
and manufacturing costs. Additional changes or other developments could have an adverse effect on our cash collection timelines and
contract margins and could result in further losses, which could be material.
In addition, on September 12, 2024, we entered into a settlement agreement regarding a project that was previously canceled by a
customer resulting in a gain of approximately $0.3 billion in the third quarter, which was recorded as $0.5 billion in revenues and $0.2 billion
in cost of sales. The settlement included recovery of costs previously incurred on the canceled project.

(a)
The computation of earnings (loss) per share for all periods through
April 1, 2024
was calculated using
274 million
common shares that
were issued upon Spin-Off and excludes Net loss (income) attributable to noncontrolling interests. For periods prior to the Spin-Off, the
Company participated in various GE stock-based compensation plans. For periods prior to the Spin-Off, there were no dilutive equity
instruments as there were no equity awards of GE Vernova outstanding prior to Spin-Off.
For the year ended
December 31, 2024
,
operating income (loss) was
$0.5 billion
, a
$1.4 billion
increase, primarily due to: an increase in
segment results at Power of
$0.5 billion
, primarily attributable to Gas Power, where higher volume, favorable pricing, and increased
productivity more than offset the impact of inflation; at Electrification of
$0.4 billion
, primarily due to higher volume, price, and productivity;
at Wind of
$0.4 billion
, primarily at Onshore Wind as a result of improved pricing, market selectivity, and the impact of cost reduction
activities, and a gain recorded on the settlement of a previously canceled project at Offshore Wind, which was partially offset by
incremental contract losses at Offshore Wind; as well as $0.3 billion re
ceived related to an arbitration refund and a $0.1 billion benefit
related to deferred intercompany profit that was recognized upon GE retaining the renewable energy U.S. tax equity investments in
connection with the Spin-Off in the second quarter; partially offset by higher corporate costs required to operate as a stand-alone public
company and separation costs.
Net income (loss) and Net income (loss) margin were
$1.6 billion
and
4.5%
, respectively, for
the
year ended
December 31, 2024
, an
increase of
$2.0 billion
and
5.9%
,
respectively,
for the year, primarily due to an increase in operating income (loss) of
$1.4 billion
and an
increase in other income of
$1.0 billion
,
driven by a
$1.0 billion
pre-tax gain from the sale of a portion of Steam Power nuclear activities to
EDF
,
partially offset by an increase in
provision
for income taxes of
$0.6 billion
.
Adjusted EBITDA* and Adjusted EBITDA margin* were
$2.0 billion
and
5.8%
, respectively, for the
year ended
December 31, 2024
, an
increase
of
$1.2 billion
and
3.4%
, respectively, primarily driven by increases in segment results at Power, Wind, and Electrification.
SEGMENT OPERATIONS
.
Segment revenues include sales of equipment and services by our segments. Segment EBITDA is
determined based on performance measures used by our
Ch
ief Operating Decision Maker, who is our Chief Executive Officer (CEO), to
assess the performance of each business in a given period. In connection with that assessment, the CEO may exclude certain non-cash
charges, such as depreciation and amortization, impairments and other matters, major restructuring programs, and certain gains and
losses from purchases and sales of business interests. Certain corporate costs, including those related to shared services, employee
benefits and IT, are allocated to our segments based on usage or their relative net cost of operations.
(a)
Includes our Financial Services business and other general corporate expenses
, including costs required to operate as a stand-alone
public company.
(b)
See "—Non-GAAP Financial Measures" for additional information related to Adjusted EBITDA*. Adjusted EBITDA* includes interest and
other financial charges and the benefit for income taxes of Financial Services as this business is managed on an after-tax basis due to
its strategic investments in tax equity investments.

Gross Profit and Gross Margin.
Gross profit was
$6.1 billion
,
$4.8 billion
, and
$3.5 billion
and gross margin was
17.4%
,
14.5%
, and
11.7%
for the years ended De
cember 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. The increase in gross profit in 2024 was due to an increase
at Power due to Gas Power Services driven from volume, mix, productivity, and price, which more than offset inflation; an increase at
Electrification due to higher volume, price, and cost productivity at Grid Solutions and Electrification
Software
; and an increase at Wind, due
to Onshore Wind through improved pricing, volume, market selectivity, and the impact of cost reduction activities, and a gain recorded on
the settlement of a previously canceled project at Offshore Wind, partially offset by incremental contract losses at Offshore Wind.
Selling, General, and Administrative.
S
elling, general, and administrative costs were
$4.6 billion
,
$4.8 billion
, and
$5.4 billion
and
comprised
13.3%
,
14.6%
, and
18.1%
of revenues for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. The decrease in
costs in 2024 was primarily attributable to a $0.3 billion arbitration refund received in the second quarter of 2024 and cost reduction
initiatives, partially offset by higher corporate costs required to operate as a stand-alone public company and separation costs.
Restructuring and Other Charges.
We continuously evaluate our cost structure and are implementing several restructuring and process
transformation actions
considered necessary
to simplify our organizational structure. In addition, in connection with the Spin-Off, we
incurred and will continue to incur certain one-time separation costs and recognized a benefit related to deferred intercompany profit upon
GE retaining the renewable energy U.S. tax equity investments. See Note
23
in the Notes to the consolidated and combined financial
statements for further information.
Research and Development (R&D).
We conduct
R&D
activities to continually enhance our existing products and services, develop new
products and services to meet our customers’ changing needs and demands, and address new market opportunities. In addition to funding
R&D internally, we also receive funding externally from our customers, partners, and governments, which contributes to the overall R&D for
the Company.
(a) Primarily related to funding in our Nuclear Power business.
(b) Includes Advanced Research.
Interest and Other Financial Charges – Net
.
Interest and other financial charges – net was a
$0.1 billion
benefit for the
year ended
December 31, 2024 and a
$0.1 billion
and
$0.2 billion
charge for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The higher
income in 2024 was primarily due t
o a higher average balance of invested funds and interest received from an arbitration refund.
T
he
primary components of net interest and other financial charges are fees on cash management activities, interest on borrowings, and
interest earned on cash balances and short-term investments.
Income Taxes.
The effective tax rate and provision (benefit) for income taxes for the
years ended
December 31, 2024
,
2023
, and 2022
were as follows:
The effective tax rate for year ended December 31, 2024 was impacted primarily by an increase in valuation allowances in the U.S. and in
certain foreign jurisdictions with losses providing no tax benefit, partially offset by a
pre-tax gain with an insignificant tax impact from the
sale of a portion of Steam Power nuclear activities to EDF.
We recorded an income tax expense on a pre-tax loss in the
years ended
December 31, 2023
and
2022 due to taxes in profitable
jurisdictions and an increase in valuation allowances from losses providing no tax benefit in other jurisdictions.
See Note

CAPIT
AL RESOUR
CES AND LIQUIDITY
.
Historically, we participated in cash pooling and other financing arrangements with GE to
manage liquidity and fund our operations. As a result of completing the Spin-Off, we no longer participate in these arrangements and our
C
ash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash are held and used solely for our own operations. Our capital structure, long-term commitments,
and sources of liquidity have changed significantly from our historical practices. In connection with the Spin-Off, we received
$0.8 billion
of
cash from GE through a cash contribution of
$0.5 billion
to fund future GE Vernova operations and a cash transfer of
$0.3 billion
restricted
in connection with certain legal matters associated with legacy GE operations, such that our cash balance on the date of the completion of
the Spin-Off was approximately
$4.2 billion
. As of
December 31, 2024
, our Cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash was
$8.2 billion
,
$0.4 billion
of which was restricted use c
ash
.
During the year ended
December 31, 2024
, we received proceeds of
$0.9 billion, net of
directly attributable taxes paid, from the
sales of a portion of our equity interest in
GE Vernova T&D India Ltd
(formerly known as GE T&D
India Ltd)
,
proceeds of $0.2 billion from the sale of a portion of our investment in
China XD Electric Co., Ltd., net cash proceeds of $0.6
billion
from our Steam Power business sale of part of its nuclear activities to EDF, and a cash refund of $0.3 billion in connection with an
arbitration proceeding
.
In addition, we have access to a
$3.0 billion
committed revolving
credit facility (Revolving Credit Facility). See “—
Capital Resources and Liquidity—Debt” for further information. We believe our unrestricted c
ash, cash equivalents
,
future
cash flows

generated from operations, and committed credit facility will be responsive to the needs of our current and planned operations for at least
the next 12 months.
On December 10, 2024, the Board of Directors declared a $0.25 per share quarterly dividend on the outstanding common stock, which we
paid on January 28, 2025, to stockholders of record as of December 20, 2024. In addition, on December 10, 2024, we announced that the
Board of Directors had authorized up to $6 billion of common stock repurchases.
Consolidated and Combined Statement of Cash Flows.
The most significant source of cash flows from operations is customer-related
activities, the largest of which is collecting cash resulting from equipment or services sales. The most significant operating uses of cash are
to pay our suppliers, employees, tax authorities, and postretirement plans. We measure ourselves on a free cash flow* basis. We believe
that free cash flow* provides management and investors with an important measure of our ability to generate cash on a normalized basis.
Free cash flow* also provides insight into our ability to produce cash subsequent to fulfilling our capital obligations; however, free cash flow*
does not delineate funds available for discretionary uses as it does not deduct the payments required for certain investing and financing
activities.
We typically invest in
PP&E
over multiple periods to support new product introductions and increases in manufacturing capacity and to
perform ongoing maintenance of our manufacturing operations. We believe that while PP&E expenditures will fluctuate period to period, we
will need to maintain a material level of net PP&E spend to maintain ongoing operations and growth of the business.
Cash from (used for) operating activities
was
$2.6 billion
and
$1.2 billion
for the
years ended
December 31, 2024
and
2023
,
respectively.
Cash
from (used for) operating activities increased by
$1.4 billion
in
2024
compared to
2023
primarily driven by: higher net income (after
adjusting for depreciation of PP&E, amortization of intangible assets, and (gains) losses on purchases and sales of business interests) of
$1.3 billion
, including the impact of a $0.3 billion cash refund we received in connection with an arbitration proceeding in the second quarter
of 2024; an increase of
$1.7 billion
in accounts payable and equipment project payables,
primarily due to lower disbursements, including a
lower impact related to prepayments compared to the prior year, and higher purchases
; partially offset by a
decrease
in current contract
assets of $(0.5) billion, due to higher revenue recognition, partially offset by an unfavorable change in estimated profitability, in Gas Power;
a decrease in current receivables of $(0.5) billion, primarily due to higher billings, an increase in past dues, and increases in supplier
advances; a decrease in inventories of $(0.4) billion,
primarily due to higher build in Power; and a decrease in due to related parties of
$(0.3) billion, primarily due to settlements of payables with GE prior to the Spin-Off in 2024.
Cash from operating activities of $2.6 billion for the
year ended
December 31, 2024
included a $1.1 billion inflow from changes in working
capital. The cash inflow from changes in working capital was primarily driven by: contract liabilities and current deferred income of $2.8
billion, driven by net collections at Power, and down payments and collections on several large projects in Grid Solutions at Electrification,
partially offset by liquidations and the settlement of a previously canceled project at Wind; accounts payable and equipment project
payables of $1.1 billion, due to material purchases outpacing disbursements,
including an increase in prepayments as we more closely
align the timing of disbursements and collections
; current receivables of $(1.3) billion,
driven
by billings outpacing collections, an increase in
past dues, and increases in supplier advances in order to secure future volume, primarily in Power; inventories of $(0.6) billion, primarily in
Gas Power, to support fulfillment and deliveries expected in 2025, partially offset by liquidations in Wind; current contract assets of $(0.4)
billion, driven by revenue recognition exceeding billings on our equipment and other service agreements in Wind and Electrification, and on
our contractual service agreements in Gas Power, partially offset by an unfavorable change in estimated profitability; and changes in due to
related parties of $(0.4) billion, primarily due to settlements of payables with GE prior to the Spin-Off.
Cash from operating activities of $1.2 billion for the
year ended
December 31, 2023
included a $1.1 billion inflow from changes in working
capital. The cash inflow from changes in working capital was primarily driven by: contract liabilities and current deferred income of $2.8
billion as a result of project collections and down payments in Power, Wind and Electrification outpacing revenue recognition; partially offset
by current receivables of $(0.8) billion, driven by billings outpacing collections across our businesses; and accounts payable and equipment
project payables of $(0.7) billion, driven by higher disbursements, including prepayments of supply chain finance programs at Wind and
Power.
Cash from (used for) investing activities
was less than
$(0.1) billion
and
$(0.7) billion
for the
years ended
December 31, 2024
and
2023
,
respectively.
Cash from (used for) investing activities increased by
$0.7 billion
in
2024
compared to
2023
primarily driven by: net proceeds from principal
business dispositions of $0.8 billion, primarily as a result of our Steam Power business sale of part of its nuclear activities to EDF in our
Power segment; and the nonrecurrence of the net impact of our acquisition of Nexus Controls and other investment sales of $0.2 billion in
2023; partially offset by an increase in additions to PP&E and internal-use software of $0.1 billion. Net sales of and distributions from equity
method investments were flat, as t
he sale of a 3% equity interest in China XD Electric Co., Ltd. in the fourth quarter of 202
4 was offset by
lower sales in our Financial Services business. Cash used for additions to PP&E and internal-use software, which is a component of free
cash flow*, was
$0.9 billion and $0.7 billion fo

Debt.
As o
f both
December 31, 2024
and
2023
, we had
$0.1 billion
of total debt, excluding finance leases. We have a
$3.0 billion
Revolving
Credit Facility to fund near-term intra-quarter working capital needs as they arise. In addition, we have a
$3.0 billion
committed trade
finance facility (Trade Finance Facility, and together with the Revolving Credit Facility,
the Credit Facilities
). The Trade Finance Facility has
not been and is not expected to be utilized, and does not contribute to direct liquidity. We believe that our financing arrangements, future
cash from operations, and access to capital markets will provide adequate resources to fund our future cash flow needs. For more
information about the Credit Facilities, refer to our Current Report on Form 8-K, filed with the SEC on April 2, 2024, and see Note 22 in the
Notes to the consolidated and combined financial statements.
Credit Ratings and Conditions.
We have access to the Revolving Credit Facility to fund operations, and we may rely on debt capital
markets in the future to further su
pport our liquidity needs. The cost and availability of any debt financing is influenced by our credit ratings
and market conditions. Standard and Poor's Global Ratings (S&P) and Fitch Ratings (Fitch) have issued credit ratings for the Company.
Our credit ratings as of the date of this filing are set forth in the following table.
We are disclosing our credit ratings to enhance understanding of our sources of liquidity and the effects of our ratings on our costs of funds
and access to credit. Our ratings may be subject to a revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization, and each
rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. S
ee Item 1A. "Risk Factors
—
Risks Relating to Our Business and Our Industry
—
Risks Relating to Operations and Supply Chain" and Item 1A. "Risk Factors
—
Risks Relating to Financial, Accounting, and Tax Matters"
for a description of some of the potential consequences of a reduction in our credit ratings.
If we are unable to maintain investment grade ratings, we could face significant challenges in being awarded new contracts, substantially
increasing financing and hedging costs, and refinancing risks as well as substantially decreasing the availability of credit. As of
December
31, 2024
, we
estimated an
insignificant
liquidity impact of a ratings downgrade below investment grade.
Parent Company Credit Support.
Prior t
o
the Spin-Off, to support GE Vernova businesses in selling products and services globally, GE
often entered into contracts on behalf of GE Vernova or issued parent company guarantees or trade finance instruments supporting the
performance of its subsidiary legal entities transacting directly with customers, in addition to providing similar credit support for non-
customer related activities of GE Vernova
(collectively, the GE credit support)
. In connection with the Spin-Off, we are working to seek
novation or assignment of GE credit support, the majority of which relates to parent company guarantees, associated with GE Vernova
legal entities from GE to GE Vernova. For GE credit support that remained outstanding at the Spin-Off, GE Vernova is obligated to use
reasonable best efforts to terminate or replace, and obtain a full release of GE’s obligations and liabilities under, all such credit support.
B
eginning in 2025, GE Vernova will pay a quarterly fee to GE based on amounts related to the GE credit support.
GE Vernova is subject to
other contractual restrictions and requirements while GE continues to be obligated under such credit support on behalf of GE Vernova. In
addition, w
hile GE will remain obligated under the contract or instrument, GE Vernova will be obligated to indemnify GE for credit support
related payments that GE is required to make and possible related costs
.
As of
December 31, 2024
, we estimated GE Vernova RPO and other obligations that relate to GE credit support to be approximately
$17
billion
, an over
74%
reduction since
December 31, 2023
and over
52%
reduction since the Spin-Off. We expect approximately
$10 billion
of
the RPO related to GE credit support obligations to contractually mature within five years from
December 31, 2024
. The underlying
obligations are predominantly customer contracts that GE Vernova performs in the normal course of its business. We have no known
instances historically where payments or performance from GE were required under parent company guarantees relating to GE Vernova
customer contracts.
RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
.
For a discussion of recently issued accounting standards, see Note
2
in the Notes to the consolidated and combined financial statements for further information.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES
.
To prepare our consolidated and combined financial statements in accordance with U.S.
GAAP, management makes estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of our assets and liabilities, including our
contingent liabilities, as of the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of our revenues and expenses during the reporting
periods. Our actual results may differ from these estimates. We consider estimates to be critical (i) if we are required to make assumptions
about material matters that are uncertain at the time of estimation or (ii) if materially different estimates could have been made or it is
reasonably likely that the accounting estimate will change from period to period. The following are areas considered to be critical and
require management’s judgment: Allocations from GE, Revenue Recognition on Service Agreements, Revenue Recognition on Equipment
on an Over-Time Basis, Goodwill, Income Taxes, Postretirement Benefit Plans, Loss Contingencies, and Environmental and Asset
Retirement Obligations. See Note
2
in the Notes to the consolidated and combined financial statements for further information regarding
our significant accounting policies.
2024 FORM 10-K
43
Allocations From GE.
The consolidated and combined financial statements include expense allocations prior to the Spin-Off for certain
corporate, infrastructure, and shared services expenses provided by GE on a centralized basis, including, but not limited to, finance, supply
chain, human resources, IT, insurance, employee benefits, and other expenses that are either specifically identifiable or clearly applicable
to GE Vernova. These expenses have been allocated to us on the basis of direct usage when identifiable, with the remainder allocated on a
pro rata basis using an applicable measure of headcount, revenue, or other allocation methodologies that are considered to be a
reasonable reflection of the utilization of services provided or the benefit received by GE Vernova during the periods presented.
Management considers that such allocations have been made on a reasonable basis; however, these allocations may not be indicative of
the actual expense that would have been incurred had we operated as an independent, stand-alone public entity.
Revenue Recognition on Service Agreements.
We have long-term service agreements with our customers within our Power and Wind
segments that require us to maintain the customers’ assets over the contract terms, which generally range from 5 to 25 years.
Power.
Within Power, these long-term service agreements, which we refer to as contractual service agreements, generally include
maintenance associated with major outage events and revenues are recognized as we perform under the arrangements using the
percentage of completion method, which is based on costs incurred relative to our estimate of total expected costs. This requires us to
make estimates of customer payments expected to be received over the contract term as well as the costs to perform required
maintenance services.
Customers generally pay us based on the utilization of the asset (per hour of usage for example) or upon the occurrence of a major
maintenance event within the contract. As a result, a significant estimate in determining expected revenues of a contract is estimating how
customers will utilize their assets over the term of the agreement. The estimate of utilization, which can change over the contract life,
impacts both the amount of customer payments we expect to receive and our estimate of future contract costs. Customers’ asset utilization
will influence the timing and extent of maintenance events over the life of the contract. We generally use historical utilization trends in
developing our revenue estimates. To develop our cost estimates, we consider the timing and extent of future maintenance events,
including the amount and cost of labor, spare parts and other resources required to perform the services.
We routinely review estimates under long-term service agreements and regularly revise them to adjust for changes in outlook. These
revisions are based on objectively verifiable information that is available at the time of the review. Contract modifications that change the
rights and obligations, as well as the nature, timing and extent of future cash flows, are evaluated for potential price concessions, contract
asset impairments and significant financing to determine if adjustments of earnings are required before effectively accounting for a modified
contract as a new contract.
We regularly assess expected billings adjustments and customer credit risk inherent in the carrying amounts of receivables and contract
assets, including the risk that contractual penalties may not be sufficient to offset our accumulated investment in the event of customer
termination. We gain insight into future utilization and cost trends, as well as credit risk, through our knowledge of the installed base of
equipment and close interaction with our customers that comes with supplying critical services and parts over extended periods. Revisions
may affect a long-term services agreement’s total estimated profitability resulting in an adjustment of earnings.
As of December 31, 2024, our net long-term service agreements balance of $3.5 billion represents approximately 5% of our total estimated
life of contract billings. Our contracts (on average) are approximately 29% complete based on costs incurred to date and our estimate of
future costs. Revisions to our estimates of future billings or costs that increase or decrease total estimated contract profitability by one
percentage point would increase or decrease the long-term service agreements contract assets balance by $0.2 billion. Billings on these
contracts were $5.0 billion during both the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023. See Notes
2
and
9
in the Notes to the consolidated
and combined financial statements for further information.
Wind.
The equipment within our Wind segment generally does not require major planned outages and revenues associated with service
agreements are recognized on a straight-line basis consistent with the nature, timing and extent of these arrangements, which generally
include planned and unplanned maintenance and may also include performance guarantees of the wind farm’s availability to operate under
adequate wind conditions. Availability is typically measured across the wind farm over a reference period of one year. Any forecasted
shortfalls that may result in a payment to a customer are recorded as a reduction of revenues, while additional revenues are recognized
when availability exceeds the contractual targets. During the
years ended Decemb
er 31, 2024, 2023,
and 2022, t
he reduction of revenues
from availability shortfalls was $0.3 billion, $0.3 billion and $0.1 billion, respectively. A further 1% reduction in availability across the entire
fleet would have resulted in an additional revenue reduction of less than $0.1 billion.
Revenue Recognition on Equipment on an Over-Time Basis.
We have agreements for the sale of customized goods, including power
generation equipment such as gas and certain wind turbines. We recognize revenues as we perform under the arrangements using the
percentage of completion method, which is based on our costs incurred to date relative to our estimate of total expected costs. This
requires us to make estimates of customer payments expected to be received over the contract term as well as the costs to complete the
project. In addition, variable consideration is included in the transaction price if, in our judgment, it is expected that a significant future
reversal of cumulative revenue under the contract will not occur. Some of our contracts with customers for the sale of equipment contain
clauses for liquidated damages related to milestones established for on-time delivery or meeting certain product specifications. On an
ongoing basis, we evaluate the probability and magnitude of having to pay liquidated damages. This is factored into our estimate of variable
consideration using the expected value method taking into consideration progress towards meeting contractual milestones, specified
liquidated damages rates, if applicable, and history of paying liquidated damages to the customer or similar customers.
Our
billing terms for these agreements are generally based on achieving specified milestones and include billing adjustments for project
delays and performance guarantees. As a result, a significant estimate in determining expected revenues of a contract is estimating project
execution timelines that may be adjusted due to internal and external supply chain adjustments, overall project execution, and product
performance. We generally use a combination of historical information as well as forward-looking information surrounding project execution
timelines and product performance in developing our revenue estimates. To develop our revenue estimates, we start with the contract price
and then make downward revisions based on historical trends. In addition, we also adjust as we become aware of new information.
2024 FORM 10-K
44
Our estimation of the total costs required to fulfill our promise to a customer is generally based on our history of manufacturing similar
assets for customers. This estimation of cost is critical to our revenue recognition process and is updated routinely to reflect changes in
quantity or cost of the inputs. In certain projects, the underlying technology or promise to the customer is unique to what we have
historically promised, and reliably estimating the total cost to fulfill the promise to the customer requires a significant level of judgment. The
estimation of costs is subject to increased subjectivity when we introduce new products and technologies, and actual costs may differ from
estimates more widely at this stage of development due to lack of historical experience.
We routinely review estimates and regularly revise them to adjust for changes in outlook. These revisions are based on objectively
verifiable information that is available at the time of the review.
Goodwill.
We test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level annually in the fourth quarter of each year using October 1st as the
measurement date. We also test goodwill for impairment when an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not
reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. An impairment charge is recognized if the carrying amount of a reporting
unit exceeds its fair value.
We determine fair value for each of the reporting units using the market approach, when available and appropriate, or the income
approach, or a combination of both. We assess the valuation methodology based upon the relevance and availability of the data at the time
we perform the valuation. If multiple valuation methodologies are used, the results are weighted appropriately.
Under the market approach fair value is derived from metrics of publicly traded companies or historically completed transactions of
comparable businesses, when available. The selection of comparable businesses is based on the markets in which the reporting units
operate giving consideration to risk profiles, size, geography, and diversity of products and services. A market approach is limited to
reporting units for which there are publicly traded companies that have characteristics similar to our businesses.
Under the income approach, fair value is determined based on the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at an
appropriate risk-adjusted rate. We use discount rates that are commensurate with the risks and uncertainty inherent in the respective
businesses and in our internally developed forecasts.
Based on the results of the impairment tests as of October 1, 2024, the fair values of our reporting units substantially exceeded their
carrying values. Estimating the fair value of reporting units involves the use of significant judgments that are based on a number of factors
including actual operating results, internal forecasts, such as forecasts of costs, margins, investments and capital expenditures, market
observable pricing multiples of similar businesses and comparable transactions, possible control premiums, determining the appropriate
discount rate and long-term growth rate assumptions, and, if multiple approaches are being used, determining the appropriate weighting
applied to each approach. It is reasonably possible that the judgments and estimates described above could change in future periods.
See
Note
8
in the Notes to the consolidated and combined financial statements
for further information.
Income Taxes.
Prior to the Spin-Off, GE Vernova was included in the consolidated U.S. federal, state and foreign income tax returns of
GE, where eligible, through April 2, 2024. We have adopted the separate return method in preparing a provision for income taxes for the
periods prior to the Spin-off. The calculation of income taxes on a separate return basis requires considerable judgment and use of both
estimates and allocations. As a result, our provision for income taxes and deferred tax assets and liabilities reflected in our consolidated
and combined financial statements for the periods 2022, 2023, and the first quarter of 2024 have been estimated as if we were a separate
taxpayer. Following the Spin-off, GE Vernova will file tax returns independently and our provision for income taxes is prepared on a stand-
alone basis.
We only recognize the tax benefits from income tax positions that have a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being sustained upon
examination by the taxing authorities. A liability is recorded for uncertain tax positions when there is a 50 percent or less likelihood such tax
position would
be sustained based on its technical merits. Significant judgement is required when evaluating tax positions for uncertainty.
We re-evaluate uncertain tax positions upon changes in facts and circumstances, changes in tax law or guidance, and upon effective
settlement of issues with tax authorities. Changes in the recognition or measurement of uncertain tax positions could result in material
increases or decreases in our provision (benefit) for income taxes in the period such determination is made.
We record deferred taxes on the future tax consequences of differences between the financial statement carrying value of our assets and
liabilities and their respective tax basis. The realization of deferred tax assets depends on sufficient sources of taxable income. Possible
sources of taxable income include taxable income in carry-back periods, the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences
recorded as a deferred tax liability, tax-planning strategies that generate future income, and projected future taxable income. If, based upon
all available evidence, both positive and negative, it is more likely than not such deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation
allowance is recorded to adjust the deferred tax assets to the net amount which is more likely than not to be realized. Significant weight is
given to evidence that is objectively verifiable such as cumulative losses in recent years; however, some evidence may be based on
estimates and assumptions regarding potential sources of future taxable income. Changes in these estimates and assumptions may result
in a change in judgement regarding the realizability of deferred tax assets.
Based on our assessment of the realizability of our deferred tax assets as of
December 31, 2024
, we continue to maintain valuation
allowances against our deferred tax assets in the U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions, primarily due to cumulative losses in those
jurisdictions. Given the current year profit and anticipated future profitability in the U.S., it is reasonably possible that the continued
improvement in our U.S. operations could result in the positive evidence necessary to warrant the release of a significant portion of our U.S.
valuation allowance as early as the second half of 2025. A release of the valuation allowance would result in the recognition of certain U.S.
deferred tax assets and a corresponding benefit in our provision for income taxes in the period the release occurs. See Note
15
in the
Notes to the consolidated and combined financial statements for further information.
Postretirement Benefit Plans.
We engage third-party actuaries to assist in the determination of pension obligations and related plan
costs. We develop significant long-term assumptions including discount rates and the expected rate of return on assets in connection with
2024 FORM 10-K
45
our pension accounting. We recognize differences between the expected long-term return on plan assets, the actual return, and net
actuarial gains and losses for the pension plan liabilities annually in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and whenever a plan is
determined to qualify for a remeasurement within the Consolidated and Combined Statement of Comprehensive Income (Loss).
Accounting requirements necessitate the use of assumptions to reflect the uncertainties and the length of time over which the pension
obligations will be paid. The actual amount of future benefit payments will depend upon when participants retire, the amount of their benefit
at retirement, and how long they live. We discount the future payments using a rate that matches the time frame over which the payments
will be made. We also assume a long-term rate of return that will be earned on investments used to fund these payments.
We evaluate these assumptions annually. We periodically evaluate other assumptions, such as compensation, retirement age, mortality,
and turnover, and update them as necessary to reflect our actual experience and expectations for the future.
We determine the discount rate using the weighted-average yields on high-quality fixed-income securities that have maturities consistent
with the timing of benefit payments. Lower discount rates increase the size of the benefit obligations and generally increase pension
expense in the following year; higher discount rates reduce the size of the benefit obligation and generally reduce subsequent-year pension
expense.
The expected return on plan assets is the estimated long-term rate of return that will be earned on the investments used to fund the
pension obligations. To determine this rate, we consider the current and target composition of plan investments, our historical returns
earned, and our expectation about the future.
As of the measurement date of
December 31, 2024
,
net periodic benefit income for 2025 is estimated to be $0.5 billion.
The components of
net periodic benefit costs, other than the service component, are included in Non-operating benefit income in our Consolidated and
Combined Statement of Income (Loss).
Fluctuations in discount rates can significantly impact pension costs and obligations. A 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate would
increase our principal pension plan cost in the following year by less than
$0.1
billion and would also expect an increase in the principal
pension plan projected benefit obligation at year-end by approximately
$0.2
billion. A 50 basis point decrease in the expected return on
assets would increase principal pension plan cost in the following year by approximately
$0.1
billion. See
Note
13
in the Notes to the
consolidated and combined financial statements for further information.
Loss
Contingencies
.
Loss contingencies are existing conditions, situations or circumstances involving uncertainty as to possible loss that
will ultimately be resolved when future events occur or fail to occur. Such contingencies include, but are not limited to, warranties,
environmental obligations, litigation, regulatory investigations and proceedings, and losses resulting from other events and developments.
When a loss is considered probable and reasonably estimable, we record a liability in the amount of our best estimate for the ultimate loss.
We consider many factors in making these assessments, including historical experience and matter specifics. Estimates are developed in
consultation with legal counsel and are based on an analysis of potential results.
When there appears to be a range of possible costs with equal likelihood, liabilities are based on the low end of such range. However, the
likelihood of a loss with respect to a particular contingency is often difficult to predict and determining a meaningful estimate of the loss or a
range of loss may not be practicable based on the information available and the potential effect of future events and negotiations with or
decisions by third parties that will determine the ultimate resolution of the contingency. Moreover, it is not uncommon for such matters to be
resolved over many years, during which time relevant developments and new information must be continuously evaluated to determine
both the likelihood of potential loss and whether it is possible to reasonably estimate a range of possible loss. Disclosure is provided for
material loss contingencies when a loss is probable, but a reasonable estimate cannot be made, and when it is reasonably possible that a
loss will be incurred or the amount of a loss will exceed the recorded provision. We regularly review contingencies to determine whether the
likelihood of loss has changed and to assess whether a reasonable estimate of the loss or range of loss can be made. See Note
22
in the
Notes to the consolidated and combined financial statements for further information.
Environmental
and
Asset
Retirement
Obligations
.
Our operations involve the use, disposal, and cleanup of substances regulated under
environmental protection laws and nuclear decommissioning regulations. We have obligations for ongoing and future environmental
remediation activities and may incur additional liabilities in connection with previously remediated sites or as a result of any restructuring
actions taken in future periods. Additionally, like many other industrial companies, we and our subsidiaries are defendants in various
lawsuits related to alleged worker exposure to asbestos or other hazardous materials. Liabilities for environmental remediation, nuclear
decommissioning and worker exposure claims exclude possible insurance recoveries.
We record asset retirement obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets as a liability in the period in which the
obligation is
incurred
and its fair value can be reasonably estimated. These obligations primarily represent legal obligations to return leased
premises to their initial state or dismantle and repair specific alterations for certain leased sites. The liability is measured at the present
value of the obligation when incurred and is adjusted in subsequent periods. Corresponding asset retirement costs are capitalized as part
of the carrying value of the related long-lived assets and depreciated over the asset’s useful life. See Note
22
i
n the Notes to the
consolidated and combined financial statements
for further information.
NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
.
The non-GAAP financial measures presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are
supplemental measures of our performance and our liquidity that we believe help investors understand our financial condition and operating
results and assess our future prospects. We believe that presenting these non-GAAP financial measures, in addition to the corresponding
U.S. GAAP financial measures, are important supplemental measures that exclude non-cash or other items that may not be indicative of or
are unrelated to our core operating results and the overall health of the Company. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures
provide investors greater transparency to the information used by management for its operational decision-making and allow investors to
see our results “through the eyes of management.” We further believe that providing this information assists our investors in understanding
our operating performance and the methodology used by management to evaluate and measure such performance. When read in
conjunction with our U.S. GAAP results, these non-GAAP financial measures provide a baseline for analyzing trends in our underlying
2024 FORM 10-K
46
businesses and can be used by management as one basis for financial, operational, and planning decisions. Finally, these measures are
often used by analysts and other interested parties to evaluate companies in our industry.
Management recognizes that these non-GAAP financial measures have limitations, including that they may be calculated differently by
other companies or may be used under different circumstances or for different purposes, thereby affecting their comparability from
company to company. In order to compensate for these and the other limitations discussed below, management does not consider these
measures in isolation from or as alternatives to the comparable financial measures determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Readers
should review the reconciliations below, and above with respect to free cash flow, and should not rely on any single financial measure to
evaluate our business. The reasons we use these non-GAAP financial measures and the reconciliations to their most directly comparable
U.S. GAAP financial measures follow.
We believe the organic measures presented below provide management and investors with a more complete understanding of underlying
operating results and trends of established, ongoing operations by excluding the effect of acquisitions, dispositions, and foreign currency,
which includes translational and transactional impacts, as these activities can obscure underlying trends.
(a) Includes intersegment sales
of
$483 million
and
$414 million
for the
years ended
December 31, 2024
and
2023
, respectively. See Note
25
in the Notes to the consolidated and combined financial state
ments for further information.
We believe that Adjusted EBITDA* and Adjusted EBITDA margin*, which are adjusted to exclude the effects of unique and/or non-cash
items that are not closely associated with ongoing operations, provide management and investors with meaningful measures of our
performance that increase the period-to-period comparability by highlighting the results from ongoing operations and the underlying
profitability factors. We believe Adjusted organic EBITDA* and Adjusted organic EBITDA margin* provide management and investors with,
when considered with Adjusted EBITDA* and Adjusted EBITDA margin*, a more complete understanding of underlying operating results
and trends of established, ongoing operations by further excluding the effect of acquisitions, dispositions, and foreign currency, which
includes translational and transactional impacts, as these activities can obscure underlying trends. We believe these measures provide
additional insight into how our businesses are performing on a normalized basis. However, Adjusted EBITDA*, Adjusted organic EBITDA*,
*Non-GAAP Financial Measure
2024 FORM 10-K
47
Adjusted EBITDA margin* and Adjusted organic EBITDA margin* should not be construed as inferring that our future results will be
unaffected by the items for which the measures adjust.
See “
—
Capital Resources and Liquidity” for discussion of free cash flow*.
ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.
We are exposed to market risk
primarily from the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and commodity prices. These exposures are
managed and mitigated with the use of financial instruments, including derivatives contracts. We apply policies to manage these risks,
including prohibitions on speculative activities.
Foreign Exchange Risk.
As a result of our global operations, we generate and incur a significant portion of our revenues and expenses in
currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Such principal currencies include the euro and British pound sterling. We are also exposed to the risk
of changes in foreign exchange rates due to our net investment in foreign operations. The effects from the foreign currency exchange rate
fluctuations on the translation of net amounts to the U.S. dollar, the reporting currency, are reflected in our equity position. See Note
2
in the
Notes to the consolidated and combined financial statements for further information regarding our net gains (losses) from foreign currency
transactions.
*Non-GAAP Financial Measure
2024 FORM 10-K
48
Foreign exchange rate risk is managed with a variety of techniques, including selective use of derivatives. It is our policy to minimize
currency exposures
by
conducting operations either within functional currencies or using the protection of hedging strategies.
A 10%
increase in exchange rates
against the U.S. dollar would have decreased our net income for the year ended December 31, 2024 by
approximately $0.1 billion. This analysis considered the net currency exposure of foreign currency denominated monetary items and
hedging instruments.
Interest Rate Risk.
We are subject to interest rate risks in the ordinary course of our business. The level of our interest rate risk is
dependent on our debt exposure and capital structure and is sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates. Historical
fluctuations in interest rates have not been significant for us; however, this may vary in the future as our capital structure changes.
Commodity Risk
.
Our operations require the use of various commodities
.
Fluctuations in the prices and availability of these commodities
can impact our cost of equipment sold and thus our profitability. To mitigate this risk, we have implemented various strategies, including
commercial actions, diversification of supplier base, and derivative instruments. We continuously monitor our exposure to commodity price
fluctuations and adjust our risk management strategies as necessary.
See Note
20
in the Notes to the consolidated and combined financial statements for further information regarding our risk exposures, our
use of derivatives, and the effects of this activity on our consolidated and combined financial statements.

ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA.
AUDITOR'S REPORT
Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the stockholders and the Board of Directors of GE Vernova Inc.
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated and combined statements of financial position of GE Vernova Inc. and subsidiaries (the
"Company") as of December 31, 2024, and 2023, the related consolidated and combined statements of income (loss), comprehensive
income (loss), changes in equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes
(collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024, and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the
Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S.
federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The
Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our
audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an
opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or
fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the
amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits
provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Critical Audit Matter Description
The Company enters into long-term service agreements with customers within its Power segment. These agreements require the Company
to provide preventative and routine maintenance services, outage services, and stand-by “warranty-type” services, which generally range
from 5 to 25 years. Revenue for these agreements is recognized using the percentage of completion method, based on costs incurred
relative to total estimated costs over the contract term. As part of the revenue recognition process, the Company estimates both customer
payments that are expected to be received and costs to perform maintenance services over the contract term. Key assumptions within
those estimates that require significant judgment from management include: (a) how the customer will utilize the assets covered over the
contract term, (b) the expected timing and extent of future maintenance and outage services, (c) the future cost of materials, labor, and
other resources, and (d) forward looking information concerning market conditions.
Given the complexity involved with evaluating the estimates, which includes significant judgment necessary to estimate future costs,
auditing management’s key assumptions within the estimates required a high degree of auditor judgment and extensive audit effort,
including the involvement of professionals with specialized skills and industry knowledge.
How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit
Our auditing procedures over the estimates and key assumptions described above related to the amount and timing of revenue recognition
of the long-term service agreements, within the Power segment, included the following, among others:
•
We evaluated management’s risk assessment process through observation of key meetings, including inspection of
documentation, addressing contract status and current market conditions.
•
We evaluated the appropriateness and consistency of management’s methods and key assumptions to develop cost estimates,
including expected timing and extent of future maintenance and outage services as well as the future cost of materials, labor and
other resources, all of which impact contract margin.
•
We tested management’s utilization assumptions for timing and extent of future maintenance and overhaul services projected for
the contract term by comparing current estimates to historical information and forward-looking market conditions.

•
We tested management’s process for estimating the timing and amount of costs associated with maintenance, outage, and other
major events throughout the contract term, including comparing estimates to historical cost experience, performing a retrospective
review, performing analytical procedures, and utilizing specialists to evaluate engineering studies used by the Company to
estimate the useful life of capital parts of certain installed equipment.

ORGANIZATION AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION
Organization.
On April 2, 2024, General Electric Company, which now operates as GE Aerospace (GE or Parent) completed the previously
announced spin-off (the Spin-Off) of
GE
Vernova Inc.
(the Company, GE Vernova, our, we, or us). The Spin-Off was completed through a
distribution of all the Company's outstanding common stock to holders of record of GE's common stock as of the close of business on
March 19, 2024 (the Distribution), which resulted in the issuance of approximately
274
million
shares of common stock. As a result of the
Distribution, the Company became an independent public company. Our common stock is listed under the symbol “GEV” on the New York
Stock Exchange.
In connection with the Spin-Off, GE contributed cash of
$
515
million
to GE Vernova to fund future operations and
transferred restricted cash of
$
325
million
to us such that the Company’s cash balance upon completion of the Spin-Off was approximately
$
4,200
million
.
See Note
22
for further information.
In connection with the Spin-Off, GE Vernova entered into several agreements with GE, including a separation and distribution agreement
that sets forth certain agreements with GE regarding the principal actions to be taken in connection with the Spin-Off, including the transfer
of assets and assumption of liabilities, and establishes certain rights and obligations between the Company and GE, including procedures
with respect to claims subject to indemnification and related matters. Other agreements we entered into that govern aspects of our
relationship with GE following the Spin-Off include:
•
Transition Services Agreement – governs all matters relating to the provision of services between the Company and GE on a
transitional basis. The services the Company receives include support for digital technology, human resources, supply chain,
finance, and real estate services, among others, that are generally intended to be provided for a period no longer than
two years
following the Spin-Off.
•
Tax Matters Agreement – governs the respective rights, responsibilities, and obligations between the Company and GE with
respect to all tax matters (excluding employee-related taxes covered under the Employee Matters Agreement), in addition to
certain restrictions which generally prohibit us from taking or failing to take any action in the
two
-year
period following the
Distribution that would prevent the Distribution from qualifying as tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes, including
limitations on our ability to pursue certain strategic transactions. The agreement specifies the portion of tax liability for which the
Company will bear contractual responsibility, and the Company and GE will each agree to indemnify each other against any
amounts for which such indemnified party is not responsible.
•
Certain other agreements related to employee matters, trademark license, intellectual property, real estate matters, and framework
investments.
Unless the context otherwise requires, references to the Company, GE Vernova, our, we, and us, refer to (i) GE’s renewable energy, power,
and digital businesses prior to the Spin-Off and (ii) GE Vernova Inc. and its subsidiaries following the Spin-Off.
GE Vernova is a global leader in the electric power industry, with products and services that generate, transfer, orchestrate, convert, and
store electricity. We design, manufacture, deliver, and service technologies to create a more reliable and sustainable electric power system,
enabling electrification and decarbonization, underpinning the progress and prosperity of the communities we serve. We report our financial
results across
three
business segments:
•
Our Power segment includes design, manufacture, and servicing of gas, nuclear, hydro, and steam technologies, providing a
critical foundation of dispatchable, flexible, stable, and reliable power.
•
Our Wind segment includes our wind generation technologies, inclusive of onshore and offshore wind turbines and blades.
•
Our Electrification segment includes grid solutions, power conversion, electrification software, and solar and storage solutions
technologies required for the transmission, distribution, conversion, storage, and orchestration of electricity from point of
generation to point of consumption.
Basis of
Presentation
.
For periods prior to the Spin-Off, the combined financial statements have been derived from the consolidated
financial statements and accounting records of GE, including the historical cost basis of assets and liabilities comprising the Company, as
well as the historical revenues, direct costs, and allocations of indirect costs attributable to the operations of the Company, using the
historical accounting policies applied by GE. These combined financial statements do not purport to reflect what the results of operations,
comprehensive income, financial position, or cash flows would have been had the Company operated as a separate, stand-alone entity
during the periods prior to the Spin-Off
.
The consolidated and combined financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles
(U.S. GAAP) and present the historical results of operations, comprehensive income and losses, and cash flows for the years ended
December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022 and the financial position as of December 31, 2024 and 2023. We have reclassified certain prior-year
amounts to conform to the current-year's presentation. The information in tables throughout the footnotes is presented in millions of U.S.
dollars unless otherwise stated. Certain columns and rows may not add due to the use of rounded numbers. Percentages presented are
calculated from the underlying numbers in millions.
All intercompany balances and transactions within the Company have been eliminated in the consolidated and combined financial
statements. As described in Note
24
, transactions between the Company and GE have been included in these consolidated and combined
financial statements. Certain financing transactions with GE are deemed to have been settled immediately through Net parent investment in
the Consolidated and Combined Statement of Financial Position and are accounted for as a financing activity in the Consolidated and
Combined Statement of Cash Flows as Transfers from (to) Parent.
For periods prior to the Spin-Off, the Consolidated and Combined Statement of Financial Position reflects all of the assets and liabilities of
GE that are specifically identifiable as being directly attributable to the Company, including Net parent investment as a component of equity.
Net parent investment represents GE’s historical investment in the Company and includes accumulated net income and losses attributable
to the Company, and the net effect of transactions with GE and its
subsidiaries
.

For periods prior to the Spin-Off, GE used a centralized approach to cash management and financing of its operations. These
arrangements may not be reflective of the way the Company would have financed its operations had it been a separate, stand-alone entity
during the periods prior to the Spin-Off. The GE centralized cash management arrangements are excluded from the asset and liability
balances in the Consolidated and Combined Statement of Financial Position for periods prior to the Spin-Off. These amounts have instead
been included in Net parent investment as a component of equity. GE’s third-party debt and, unless specifically attributable, the related
interest expense, has not been attributed to the Company because the Company is not the legal obligor of the debt and the borrowings are
not specifically identifiable to the Company. See Note
24
for further information.
For periods prior to the Spin-Off, the Consolidated and Combined Statement of Income (Loss) includes expense allocations for certain
corporate, infrastructure, and shared services expenses provided by GE on a centralized basis (GE Corporate Costs), including, but not
limited to, finance, supply chain, human resources, IT, insurance, employee benefits, and other expenses that are either specifically
identifiable or clearly applicable to the Company. These expenses have been allocated to the Company on the basis of direct usage when
identifiable, with the remainder allocated on a pro rata basis using an applicable measure of headcount, revenue, or other allocation
methodologies that are considered to be a reasonable reflection of the utilization of services provided or the benefit received by GE
Vernova during the periods prior to the Spin-Off. However, the GE Corporate Costs allocations may not be indicative of the actual expense
that would have been incurred had the Company operated as an independent, stand-alone public entity. See Note
24
for further
information.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Estimates and Assumptions.
The preparation of the consolidated and combined financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP
requires management to make estimates based on assumptions about current, and for some estimates, future, economic and market
conditions which affect reported amounts and related disclosures in the consolidated and combined financial statements. We believe these
assumptions to be reasonable under the circumstances and although our current estimates contemplate current and expected future
conditions, as applicable, it is reasonably possible that actual conditions could differ from our expectations, which could materially affect our
results of operations, financial position and cash flows.
Estimates are used for, but are not limited to, determining revenue from contracts with customers, recoverability of inventory, long-lived
assets and investments, valuation of goodwill and intangible assets, useful lives used in depreciation and amortization, income taxes and
related valuation allowances, accruals for contingencies including legal, product warranties and environmental, asset retirement obligations,
actuarial assumptions used to determine costs of pension and postretirement benefits, valuation and recoverability of receivables, valuation
of derivatives, and valuation of assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and contingent consideration as a result of acquisitions.
Revenues from the Sale of Equipment.
Sales of equipment include the sales of gas turbines, wind turbines and repower units, and other
power generation equipment related to
energy
production as well as substation solutions, high-voltage direct current (HVDC) solutions,
transformers, and switchgears for the transmission and distribution of electricity.
Performance Obligations Satisfied Over Time.
We recognize revenue on agreements for the sale of customized goods including power
generation equipment and long-term construction contracts on an over-time basis as we customize the customer’s equipment during the
manufacturing or integration process and obtain right to payment for work performed.
We recognize revenue as we perform under the arrangements using the percentage of completion method, which is based on our costs
incurred to date relative to our estimate of total expected costs and the transaction price to which we expect to be entitled. V
ariable
consideration is included in the transaction price if, in our judgment, it is expected that a significant future reversal of cumulative revenue
under the contract will not occur.
Some of our contracts with customers for the sale of equipment contain clauses for the payment of
liquidated damages related to milestones established for on-time delivery or meeting certain performance specifications. On an ongoing
basis, we evaluate the probability and magnitude of liquidated damages. This is factored into our estimate of variable consideration using
the expected value method taking into consideration progress towards meeting contractual milestones, specified liquidated damages rates,
if applicable, and history of paying liquidated damages to the customer or similar customers. Our estimate of costs to be incurred to fulfill
our promise to a customer is based on our history of manufacturing or constructing similar assets for customers and is updated routinely to
reflect changes in quantity or cost of the inputs. In certain projects, such as new product introductions, the underlying technology or
promise to the customer is unique to what we have historically promised and reliably estimating the total cost to fulfill the promise to the
customer requires a significant level of judgment. Where the profit from a contract cannot be estimated reliably, revenue is only recognized
equaling the cost incurred to the extent that it is probable that the costs will be recovered. We provide for a potential loss on these
agreements when it is expected that we will incur such loss.
During the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, primarily as a result of c
hanges in product and project cost estimat
es, we recorded
incremental contract losses for certain Offshore Wind contracts of
$
1,005
million
and
$
379
million
, respectively. The incremental contract
losses in 2024 primarily relate to
the estimated impact of changes in execution timelines, project-related commercial liabilities, costs to
remediate quality issues including the removal of previously installed blades at the Vineyard Wind project, and additional project-related
supply chain and manufacturing costs.
Further changes in our execution timelines or other adverse developments could result in further
losses beyond the amounts that we currently
estimate
.
Our billing terms for these over-time contracts are generally based on achieving specified milestones. The differences between the timing of
our revenue recognized (based on costs incurred) and customer billings (based on contractual terms) results in changes to our contract
asset or contract liability positions. See Note
9
for further information.
Performance Obligations Satisfied at a Point in Time
.
We recognize revenue on agreements for non-customized equipment and other
goods we manufacture on a standardized basis for sale to the market at the point in time that the customer obtains control of the product,
which is generally no earlier than when the customer has physical possession. We recognize revenue based on the transaction price to
which we expect to be entitled based on our history and estimates regarding variable consideration such as performance and delivery
2024 FORM 10-K
58
commitments. We use proof of delivery for certain large equipment with more complex logistics, whereas the delivery of other equipment is
estimated based on historical averages of in-transit periods (i.e., time between shipment and delivery).
Where arrangements include customer acceptance provisions based on seller or customer-specified objective criteria, we recognize
revenue when we have concluded that the customer has control of the equipment, and that acceptance is likely to occur. We do not
provide for anticipated losses on point-in-time transactions prior to transferring control of the equipment to the customer.
Our billing terms for these point-in-time equipment contracts generally coincide with delivery to the customer; however, we receive progress
collections from customers for large equipment purchases to generally reserve production slots.
Revenues from the Sale of Services
.
Sales of services include sales from contracts that include the sales of parts and labor associated
with servicing customers’ installed base in addition to software related offerings, extended warranties, equipment upgrades, and other
service-type activities.
Consistent with the way we manage our businesses and interact with customers, we refer to sales under service
agreements, which includes both goods (such as spare parts and equipment upgrades) and related services (such as monitoring,
maintenance and repairs) as sales of “services,” which is an important part of our operations.
See Note
9
for further information.
Performance Obligations Satisfied Over Time.
We enter into long-term service agreements, which we refer to as contractual service
agreements, with our customers within our Power segment. These agreements require us to provide preventative and routine maintenance,
outage services, and standby “warranty type” services that include certain levels of assurance regarding asset performance and uptime
throughout the contract periods, which generally range from
5
to
25
years
. We account for items that are integral to the maintenance of the
equipment as part of our performance obligation unless the customer has a substantive right to make a separate purchasing decision for
services such as equipment upgrades. When determined to be a separate performance obligation, revenue for equipment upgrades is
r
ecognized over time
as our performance enhances the customer’s asset.
We recognize revenue as we perform under these arrangements using the percentage of completion method, which is based on our costs
incurred to date relative to our estimate of total expected costs and the transaction price to which we expect to be entitled under the terms
of the contract. Throughout the life of a contract, this measure of progress captures the nature, timing and extent of our underlying
performance activities as our stand-ready services often fluctuate between routine inspections and maintenance, unscheduled service
events and major outages at predetermined usage intervals. We provide for a potential loss on these agreements when it is expected that
we will incur such loss.
Our billing terms for these arrangements are generally based on the customers’ utilization of the equipment (e.g., per hour of usage) and
upon the occurrence of a major maintenance event within the contract, such as an outage. The differences between the timing of our
revenue recognized (based on costs incurred) and customer billings (based on contractual terms) result in changes to our contract asset or
contract liability positions. See Note
9
for further information.
We also enter into long-term service agreements, which we refer to as
flexible
service agreements, in our Wind segment. Revenues are
recognized for these arrangements on a straight-line basis consistent with the nature, timing and extent of our services, which primarily
relate to routine maintenance and as needed equipment repairs. We generally invoice periodically as services are provided.
Performance Obligations Satisfied at a Point in Time.
We sell certain tangible products, largely spare parts, through our services
businesses. We recognize revenues and bill our customers at the point in time that the customer obtains control of the good, which is at the
point in time we deliver the spare part to the customer
.
Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash
.
Short-term investments and money market instruments with original maturities of three
months or less are included in Cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash. Restricted cash primarily relates to funds restricted in
connection with contractual and legal restrictions
and amounted to
$
438
million
and
$
50
million
as of December 31, 2024 and 2023,
respectiv
ely. See Note
22
for further information.
Customer Receivables.
Amounts due from customers arising from the sales of equipment and services are recorded at the outstanding
amount, less allowance for losses. We regularly monitor the recoverability of our receivables.
See Note
4
for further information.
Allowance for Credit Losses.
When we record customer receivables, contract assets, and financing receivables, as well as financial
guarantees and certain commitments, we record an allowance for credit losses for the current expected credit losses inherent in the asset
over its expected life. The allowance for credit losses is a valuation account deducted from the amortized cost basis of the assets to
present the assets’ net carrying value at the amount expected to be collected. In each period, the allowance for credit losses is adjusted
through earnings to reflect expected credit losses over the remaining lives of the assets.
We estimate expected credit losses based on relevant information about past events, including historical experience, current conditions,
and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount. When measuring expected credit losses, we
pool assets with similar country risk and credit risk characteristics. Changes in the relevant information may significantly affect the
estimates of expected credit losses.
Inventories
.
All inventories are stated at lower of cost or realizable values. Cost of inventories is primarily determined on a first-in, first-out
basis. Write-downs for excess, slow moving, and obsolete inventory are recorded as necessary. To determine these amounts, inventory
quantities on-hand are regularly reviewed and compared to historical utilization and estimates of future product demand, market conditions,
and technological developments.
See Note
5
for further information.
Property, Plant, and Equipment.
The cost of property, plant, and equipment is generally depreciated on a straight-line basis over its
estimated economic life.
See Note
6
for further information.
2024 FORM 10-K
59
Leases
.
At lease commencement, we record a lease liability and corresponding right-of-use (ROU) asset, included in Property, plant, and
equipment. Options to extend the lease are included as part of the ROU asset and liability when it is reasonably certain the Company will
exercise the option. We have elected to include lease and non-lease components in determining our lease liability for all leased assets
except our vehicle leases. Non-lease components are generally services that the lessor performs for the Company associated with the
leased asset. As the Company’s leases typically do not provide an implicit rate, the present value of our lease liability is determined using
the Company
’s incremental collateralized borrowing rat
e at lease commencement. For leases with an initial term of 12 months or less, an
ROU asset and lease liability are not recognized and lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Certain of
our leases include provisions for variable lease payments which are based on, but not limited to, maintenance, insurance, taxes, index
escalations, and usage based amounts. The Company recognizes variable lease payments not included in its lease liabilities in the period
in which the obligation for those payments is incurred. We test ROU assets whenever events or changes
in
circumstance indicate that the
asset may be impaired.
See Notes
6
and
7
for further information.
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.
We test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level annually in the fourth quarter of each
year using October 1st as the measurement date. We also test goodwill for impairment when an event occurs or circumstances change that
would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. We recognize an impairment charge if the
carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value.
For other intangible assets, cost is generally amortized on a straight-line basis over the asset’s estimated economic life. Amortizable
intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts
may not be recoverable. In these circumstances, they are tested for impairment based on undiscounted cash flows and, if impaired, written
down to estimated fair value based on either discounted cash flows or appraised values.
See Note
8
for further information.
Derivatives and Hedging.
We use derivatives to reduce the earnings, equity, and cash flow volatility associated with risks related to
foreign currency and commodity prices. We use derivatives solely for managing risks and do not use derivatives for speculative purposes.
Accounting for derivatives as hedges requires that, at inception and over the term of the arrangement, the hedged item and related
derivative meet the requirements for hedge accounting. In evaluating whether a particular relationship qualifies for hedge accounting, we
test effectiveness at inception and each reporting period thereafter by determining whether changes in the fair value of the derivative
instrument offset, within a specified range, changes in the fair value of the hedged item. If fair value changes fail this test, we discontinue
the application of hedge accounting to that relationship prospectively. Fair value of both the derivative instrument and the hedged item are
calculated using internal valuation models incorporating market-based assumptions.
We use economic hedges when we have exposures to foreign exchange and commodity risk for which we are unable to meet the
requirements for hedge accounting. These derivatives are not designated as hedges from an accounting standpoint but otherwise serve the
same economic purpose as other hedging arrangements. Although derivatives may be effective economic hedges, there may be a net
effect on earnings in each period due to differences in the timing of earnings recognition between the derivatives and the hedged items.
See Note
20
for further information.
Equity Method Investments.
Investments in which we have the ability to exercise significant influence, but do not control, are accounted
for under the equity method of accounting. While a voting percentage of 20% is generally presumed to demonstrate significant influence,
other indicators such as board representation or participation in policy-making processes are considered in determining whether significant
influence exists. Equity method investments are assessed for other-than-temporary impairment when events occur or circumstances
change that indicate it is more likely than not the fair value of the asset is below its carrying
value
. Our proportionate interest in any intra-
entity profits or losses of an equity method investment are eliminated until the related profit and losses are realized by the investee. Our
share of the results of equity method investments is recognized within Other (income) expense – net in the Consolidated and Combined
Statement of Income (Loss).
See Note
11
for further information.
Variable Interest Entities.
Arrangements in which voting or similar rights may not be indicative of control are reviewed under the guidance
for variable interest entities (VIEs). We consolidate VIEs for which we are the primary beneficiary, and if we are not the primary beneficiary
and an ownership interest is held, the VIE is generally accounted for under the equity method of accounting. When assessing the
determination of the primary beneficiary, we consider all relevant facts and circumstances, including our power to direct the activities of the
VIE that most significantly impact its economic performance and the obligation to absorb the expected
losses
and/or the right to receive the
expected returns of the VIE.
See Note
21
for further information.
Income Taxes
.
Prior to the Spin-off, GE Vernova was included in the consolidated U.S. federal, state, and foreign income tax returns of
GE, where eligible, through April 2, 2024. The Company's provision for income taxes for the periods 2022, 2023, and the first quarter of
2024 was prepared using the separate return method. On a separate return basis, actual transactions included in the consolidated and
combined financial statements of GE may not be included in the GE Vernova consolidated and combined financial statements. Similarly,
the tax treatment of certain items reflected in the consolidated and combined financial statements of GE Vernova may not be reflected in
the consolidated and
combined
financial statements and tax returns of GE. Therefore, items such as tax loss carryforwards, tax credit
carryforwards, and valuation allowances may exist in the separate GE Vernova consolidated and combined financial statements that may
or may not exist in GE’s consolidated and combined financial statements. Following the Spin-off, GE Vernova will file tax returns
independently and the Company's provision for income taxes is prepared on a stand-alone basis. As a result, the deferred income taxes
and effective tax rate reported in 2024 may differ from those reported in the historical periods prior to the Spin-off.
We only recognize the tax benefits from income tax positions that have a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being sustained upon
examination by the taxing authorities.
A liability is recorded for uncertain tax positions when there is a 50 percent or less likelihood such tax
position would be sustained based on its technical merits
. We re-evaluate uncertain tax positions upon changes in facts and circumstances,
changes in tax law or guidance, and upon effective settlement of issues with tax authorities. We classify interest on tax deficiencies or
overpayments as interest expense or income in Interest and other financial charges – net and income tax penalties as a Provision (benefit)
for income taxes in the Consolidated and Combined Statement of Income (Loss).
2024 FORM 10-K
60
We record deferred taxes on the future tax consequences of differences between the financial statement carrying value of our assets and
liabilities and their respective tax basis. The realization of deferred tax assets depends on sufficient sources of taxable income. Possible
sources of taxable income include taxable income in carry-back periods, the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences
recorded as a deferred tax liability, tax-planning strategies that generate future income, and projected future taxable income. If, based upon
all available evidence, both positive and negative, it is more likely than not such deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation
allowance is recorded to adjust the deferred tax assets to the net amount which is more likely than not to be realized.
See Note
15
for further information.
Postretirement Benefit Plans
. Certain employees, former employees, and retirees of the Company participate in postretirement benefit
plans sponsored by the Company.
Management presents these plans sponsored by the Company in
three
categories: principal pension plans, other pension plans, and
principal retiree benefit plans. Plan assets are categorized for disclosure purposes in accordance with the fair value hierarchy. Benefits are
calculated using significant inputs to the actuarial models that measure benefit obligations and related effects on operations. The Company
evaluates critical assumptions, including discount rates and expected return on assets, at least annually on a plan and country-specific
basis. Actual results in any given year often will differ from actuarial assumptions because of economic and other factors.
Projected benefit obligations are measured as the present value of expected payments. We discount those cash payments using the
weighted average of market-observed yields for high-quality fixed-income securities with maturities that correspond to the expected timing
of benefit payments. Generally, lower discount rates increase present values and increase subsequent-year pension expense, while higher
discount rates decrease present values and decrease subsequent-year pension expense. The components of net periodic benefit costs,
other than the service cost component, are recognized within Non-operating benefit income in the Consolidated and Combined Statement
of Income (Loss). The Company delays recognition of gains and losses and subsequently amortizes these amounts into earnings over the
remaining average future service of active employees or the expected life of inactive participants, as applicable, who participate in the plan.
For the principal pension plans, gains and losses are amortized using a straight-line method with a separate layer for each year's gains and
losses. For most other pension plans and principal retiree benefit plans, gains and losses are amortized using a straight-line or a corridor
amortization method. See Note
13
for further information.
Loss Contingencies.
Loss contingencies are existing conditions, situations or circumstances involving uncertainty as to possible loss that
will ultimately be resolved when future events occur or fail to occur. Such contingencies include, but are not limited to warranties,
environmental obligations, litigation, regulatory investigations and proceedings, and losses resulting from other events and developments.
When a loss is considered probable and reasonably estimable, we record a liability in the amount of our best estimate for the ultimate loss.
When there appears to be a range of possible costs with equal likelihood, liabilities are based on the low end of such range. Disclosure is
provided for material loss contingencies when a loss is probable but a reasonable estimate cannot be made, and when it is reasonably
possible that a loss will be incurred or the amount of a loss will exceed the recorded provision. We regularly review contingencies to
determine whether the likelihood of loss has changed and to assess whether a reasonable estimate of the loss or range of loss can be
made
See Note

for further information.
Supply Chain Finance Programs.
We evaluate supply chain finance programs to ensure where we use a third party intermediary to settle
our trade payables, their involvement does not change the nature, existence, amount, or timing of our trade payables and does not provide
the Company with any direct economic benefit. If any characteristics of the trade payables change or we receive a direct economic benefit,
we reclassify the trade payables as borrowings.
Accounts Payable and Equipment Project Payables
. Accounts payable and equipment project payables include amounts due to
suppliers and liabilities for costs and expenses incurred or accrued for which invoices have not been received.
Fair Value Measurements.
The following sections describe the valuation methodologies we use to measure financial and non-financial
instruments accounted for at fair value, including certain assets within our pension plans and retiree benefit plans. Observable inputs reflect
market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect our market assumptions. These inputs establish a fair
value hierarchy:
Level 1 - Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets;
Level 2 - Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that
are not active; and model-derived valuations whose inputs are observable or whose significant value drivers are observable; and
Level 3 - Significant inputs to the valuation model are unobservable.
Recurring Fair Value Measurements.
For financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis, fair value is the price
we would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction with a market participant at the measurement date. In
the absence of active markets for the identical assets or liabilities, such measurements involve developing assumptions based on market
observable data and, in the absence of such data, internal information that is consistent with what market participants would use in a
hypothetical transaction that occurs at the measurement date.
Derivatives.
Derivative assets and liabilities primarily represent foreign currency and commodity forward contracts. The majority of our
derivatives are valued using internal models. The models maximize the use of market observable inputs including interest rate curves and
both forward and spot prices for currencies and commodities and therefore are considered Level 2. See Note
20
for further information.
Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements
. Certain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. These assets
and liabilities may include loans and long-lived assets reduced to fair value upon classification as held for sale, impaired equity method
investments, loans, and long-lived assets, assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with business combinations, and
remeasured retained investments in formerly combined subsidiaries upon a change in control that results in the deconsolidation of that
2024 FORM 10-K
61
subsidiary and retention of a noncontrolling stake in the entity. Assets written down to fair value when impaired and retained investments
are not subsequently adjusted to fair value unless further impairment occurs.
Equity Method Investments.
Equity method investments are initially recorded at cost and are adjusted in each period for the Company’s
share of the investee’s income or loss and dividends paid. In instances of impairment, equity method investments are written down to fair
value using market observable data such as quoted prices when available. When market observable data is unavailable, investments are
valued using either a discounted cash flow model, comparative market multiples, third-party pricing sources or a combination of these
approaches, as appropriate. These investments are generally valued using Level 3 inputs.
Financing Receivables.
When financing receivables are held for sale, we generally use market data, including pricing on recently closed
market transactions, to value financing receivables. Such financing receivables are valued using Level 2 inputs. When the data is
unobservable, we use valuation methodologies using current market interest rate data adjusted for inherent credit risk. Such financing
receivables are valued using Level 3 inputs.
Long-lived Assets.
Fair values of long-lived assets are primarily derived internally and are corroborated by available external appraisal
information as applicable. These assets are generally valued using Level 3 inputs.
Restructuring Cost
s.
We record liabilities for costs associated with exit or disposal activities in the period in which the liability is incurred.
Employee termination costs are accrued when the restructuring actions are probable and estimable. Costs for one-time termination benefits
in which the employee is required to render service until termination in order to receive the benefits are recognized ratably over the future
service period.
See Note
23
for further information.
Research and Developmen
t.
The Company conducts research and development (R&D) activities to continually enhance our existing
products and services, develop new products and services to meet our customers’ changing needs and requirements, and address new
market opportunities. This includes internal R&D expenses as well as expenses incurred for R&D s
ervices from
third parties. R&D costs are
expensed as incurred.
Government Assistance
.
We receive grants, incentives, and refundable tax credits from various federal, state, local, and foreign
governments in exchange for compliance with certain conditions relating to our activities in a specific jurisdiction which encourage
investment, job creation and retention, and environmental objectives including renewable energy production and emissions reductions. We
recognize government incentives as a reduction to the related expense or asset
when
there is reasonable assurance that the Company will
comply with the conditions of the incentive, the incentive is received or is probable of receipt, and the amount is determinable.
Government
grants resulted in reductions of

Foreign Currency.
We determine the functional currency of foreign subsidiaries based on their primary operations that generate and
expend cash. The functional currency for many of our international operations is the local currency, and for other international operations,
the functional currency is the U.S.
d
ollar. When the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar, asset and liability accounts are translated at
period-end exchange rates, and the Company translates functional currency income and expense amounts to their U.S. dollar equivalents
using average exchange rates for the period. The U.S. dollar effects that arise from changing translation rates from functional currencies
are recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) – net attributable to GE Vernova (AOCI) in the Consolidated and
Combined Statement of Financial Position.
Gains and losses from foreign currency transactions, such as those resulting from the settlement of monetary items in the non-functional
currency and those resulting from remeasurements of monetary items, are included in Cost of equipment, Cost of services and Selling,
general, and administrative expenses depending on the underlying nature of the item.
Net gains (losses) from foreign currency transactions

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
.
In November 2024, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued
ASU
No.
2024-03,
Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses (
DISE
)
. The new standard requires disclosure about specific types of expenses
included in the expense captions presented on the face of the income statement as well as disclosure about selling expenses. The ASU is
effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2026 and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2027, with early
adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact that this guidance will have on the disclosures within our consolidated and
combined financial statements.
In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09,
Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures
. The
amendments require disclosure of specific categories in the rate reconciliation and provide additional information for reconciling items that
meet a quantitative threshold and further disaggregation of income taxes paid for individually significant jurisdictions. The ASU is effective
for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact that this guidance
will have on the disclosures within our consolidated and combined financial statements.

POSTRETIREMENT BEN
EFIT PLANS
Pension Benefits and Retiree Health and Life Benefits Sponsored by GE, Allocated to GE Vernova in Connection with the Spin-
Off.
On January 1, 2023, in advance of the Spin-Off, principal and other pension plans sponsored by GE, which were previously accounted
for as multiemployer plans, were legally split and allocated to GE Vernova beginning in 2023. Liabilities related to the retiree health and life
benefit plans sponsored by GE were allocated to GE Vernova as a participating employer and are accounted for as multiple employer plans
starting in 2023.
Prior to the separation of these plans, certain GE Vernova employees were covered under various pension and retiree health and life plans
sponsored by GE, including the GE Pension Plan and GE Supplementary Pension Plan, the retiree benefit plans, and other pension plans.
Relevant participation costs for certain GE-sponsored employee benefit plans were allocated to the Company and recognized in the
Combined Statement of Income (Loss) for the year ended December 31, 2022. These included service costs for active employees in the
GE Pension Plan, the GE Supplementary Pension Plan, the retiree benefit plans, and other pension plans. We did not record any assets or
liabilities associated with our participation in these plans in our Combined Statement of Financial Position as of December 31, 2022.
Expenses associated with our employees' participation in the principal pension plans and principal retiree benefit plans, which represent
the majority of related expense, were
$
61

for the year ended December 31, 2022.
Defined Contribution Plan.
Following the Spin-Off, GE Vernova now sponsors a defined contribution plan for its eligible U.S. employees
that is similar to the corresponding GE-sponsored defined contribution plan that was in effect prior to the Spin-Off. Expenses associated
with their participation in GE Vernova's plan for the year ended December 31, 2024 beginning on April 2, 2024 and in GE's plan through

Assumptions Used in Calculations
. Our defined benefit pension plans are accounted for on an actuarial basis, which requires the
selection of various assumptions, including a discount rate, a compensation assumption, an expected return on assets, mortality rates of
participants and expectation of mortality improvement.
Projected benefit obligations are measured as the present value of expected benefit payments. We discount those cash payments using a
discount rate. We determine the discount rate using the weighted-average yields on high-quality fixed-income securities with maturities that
correspond to the payment of benefits. Lower discount rates increase present values and generally increase subsequent-year pension
expense; higher discount rates decrease present values and generally reduce subsequent-year pension expense.
The compensation assumption is used to estimate the annual rate at which pay of plan participants will grow. If the rate of growth assumed
increases, the size of the pension obligations will increase, as will the amount recorded in AOCI in our Statement of Financial Position and
amortized into earnings in subsequent periods.
The expected return on plan assets is the estimated long-term rate of return that will be earned on the investments used to fund the benefit
obligations. To determine the expected long-term rate of return on pension plan assets, we consider our asset allocation, as well as
historical and expected returns on various categories of plan assets. In developing future long-term return expectations for our principal
benefit plans’ assets, we formulate views on the future economic environment, both in the U.S. and abroad. We evaluate general market
trends and historical relationships among a number of key variables that impact asset class returns such as expected earnings growth,
inflation, valuations, yields and spreads, using both internal and external sources. We also take into account expected volatility by asset
class and diversification across classes to determine expected overall portfolio results given our asset allocation. B
ased on our analysis, we
have assumed a
7.0
%
long-term expected return on the GE Energy Pension Plan assets for cost recognition in
2024
and
2025
.
The healthcare trend assumptions primarily apply to our pre-65 retiree medical plans. Most participants in our post-65 retiree plan have a
fixed subsidy and therefore are not subject to healthcare inflation.
We evaluate these critical assumptions at least annually on a plan and country-specific basis. We periodically evaluate other assumptions
involving demographics factors such as retirement age and turnover, and update them to reflect our actual experience and expectations for
the future. Actual results in any given year will often differ from actuarial assumptions because of economic and other factors. Differences
between our actual results and what we assumed are recorded in AOCI each period and are amortized into earnings over the remaining
average future service of active participating employees or the expected life of inactive participants, as
applicable

Composition of our Plan Assets
.
The fair value of our pension plans' investments is presented below. The inputs and valuation
techniques used to measure the fair value of these assets are described in Note
2
and have been applied consistently.
(a)
GE Energy Pension Plan assets as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 include
$
1,299
million
and $
2,105
million
, respectively, of U.S.
corporate debt securities, primarily made up of investment-grade bonds of U.S. issuers from diverse industries, and
$
1,646
million
and
$
1,932
million
, respectively, of other debt securities, primarily made up of investments in residential and commercial mortgage-backed
securities, non-U.S. corporate and government bonds and U.S. government, federal agency, state, and municipal debt. Other pension
plan assets as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 include debt securities primarily made up of fixed income and cash investment funds.
Those investments that were measured at Net Asset Value (NAV) as a practical expedient were excluded from the fair value hierarchy.
GE Energy Pension Plan investments with a fair value of
$
399
million and
$
383
million
at December 31, 2024 and
2023
, respectively, were
classified within Level 3 and primarily relate to private equities and real estate. The remaining investments were substantially all considered
Level 1 and 2. Investments with a fair value of
$
1,667
million and
$
1,272
million
at December 31, 2024 and
2023
, respectively, were
classified within Level 1 and primarily relate to global equities and debt securities. Investments with a fair value of
$
5,254
million and
$
4,050
million
at December 31, 2024 and
2023
, respectively, were classified within Level 2 and primarily relate to debt securities.
Other pension plan investments with a fair value of
$
256
million and
$
18
million
at December 31,
2024
and
2023
, respectively, were
classified within Level 3 and primarily relate to private equities and real estate. The increase in the Level 3 category during
2024
was
primarily due to hierarchy reassessment. The remaining investments were substantially all considered Level 1 and 2. Investments with a
fair value of
$
498
million
and
$
757
million
at December 31,
2024
and
2023
, respectively, were classified within Level 1 and primarily relate
to global equities and debt securities. Investments with a fair value of
$
3,656
million
and
$
2,766
million
at December 31,
2024
and
2023
,
respectively, were classified within Level 2 and primarily relate to debt securities.
Plan fiduciaries set investment policies and strategies for the assets held in the pension plans and oversee their investment allocations,
which includes selecting investment
managers
and setting long-term strategic targets.

Effective Tax Rate Reconciliation.
A reconciliation of the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate to the effective tax rate was as follows:
(a)
U.S. business credits and incentives primarily includes the tax benefit of the advanced manufacturing credit, tax credits for energy
produced from renewable sources, and tax credits for research performed in the U.S. The Company uses the flow-through method to
account for investment tax credits. Under this method, the investment tax credits are recognized as a reduction to income tax expense.
(b)
Business disposition resulted from a
pre-tax gain with an insignificant tax impact from the sale of a portion of Steam Power nuclear
activities to EDF.
The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development has proposed a global minimum tax of 15% of reported profits (Pillar Two)
that has been agreed upon in principle by over 140 countries. During 2023, many countries took steps to incorporate Pillar Two model rule
concepts into their domestic laws. Although the model rules provide a framework for applying the minimum tax, countries may enact Pillar
Two slightly differently than the model rules and on different timelines and may adjust domestic tax incentives in response to Pillar Two.
Accordingly, we continue to evaluate the potential consequences of Pillar Two on our longer-term financial position as related tax laws are
enacted. In
2024
, we incurred insignificant tax expenses in connection with Pillar Two
.
2024 FORM 10-K

Deferred Income Taxes.
The components of the net deferred tax asset (liability) for the years ended December 31 were as follows:
(a)
Certain U.S. tax attributes, primarily tax loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards, were retained by GE following the Spin-off.
See Note
1
for further information regarding the Tax Matters Agreement.
(b)
Tax loss carryforwards as of
December 31, 2024
are primarily related to Switzerland and other foreign jurisdictions, which if unused,
approximately
$
2,349
million
will expire between 2025-2044 and
$
3,373
million
do not expire.
(c) Tax credit carryforwards as of
December 31, 2024
are
primarily related to U.S. foreign tax credits and research performed in the U.S.,
which if unused, will expire in various years through 2034.
(d) Valuation allowances decreased by
$
1,286
million
in 2024
primarily due to a reduction in deferred tax assets related to certain U.S. tax
attributes retained by GE following the Spin-off and a
$
140
million
net decrease resulting from a change in judgement regarding the
realizability of deferred tax assets in certain foreign jurisdictions, partially offset by additional tax loss carryforwards in certain foreign
jurisdictions where it is more likely than not the tax benefits will not be realized.
(e)
We recognized
$
287
million
of foreign deferred tax l
iabilities transferred from GE in 2024 related to separation activities. See Note
1
for
further information regarding the Tax Matters Agreement.
We regularly assess the realizability of our deferred tax assets based on all available evidence both positive and negative. Based on our
assessment of the realizability of our deferred tax assets as of
December 31, 2024
, we continue to maintain valuation allowances against
our deferred tax assets in the U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions, primarily due to cumulative losses in those jurisdictions. Given the
current year profit and anticipated future profitability in the U.S., it is reasonably possible that the continued improvement in our U.S.
operations could result in the positive evidence necessary to warrant the release of a significant portion of our U.S. valuation allowance as
early as the second half of 2025. A release of the valuation allowance would result in the recognition of certain U.S. deferred tax assets and
a corresponding benefit in our provision for income taxes in the period the release occurs.
As of
December 31, 2024
, we recognized a
$
103
million
deferred tax liability, primarily related to withholding taxes, on undistributed
earnings we anticipate repatriating from certain highly
-i
nflationary or currency restricted foreign jurisdictions. N
o
deferred tax liability has
been provided on undistributed earnings of approximately
$
6,500
million
from all other foreign subsidiaries which are considered to be
permanently reinvested. It is not practicable to determine the applicable income taxes payable on the permanently reinvested earnings if
fully repatriated to the U.S.
Income Taxes Paid.
The Company's portion of income taxes for
U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions prior to the separation were deemed
settled at the date of the Spin-Off. Cash paid directly to tax authorities for income taxes was
$

million
in
2024
and was
no

significant
in

Uncertain Tax Positions.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending liability for uncertain tax positions was as follows:
Of the
$
638
million
and
$
886
million
liability for uncertain tax positions including interest and penalties at
December 31, 2024
and
2023
,
respectively,
$
434
million
and
$
651
million
, respectively, are recorded in All other liabilities and
$
204
million
and
$
235
million
, respectively,
are recorded as a net offset to Deferred income taxes on our Combined Statement of Financial Position. If recognized,
$
318
million
and
$
251
million
of the liability for uncertain tax positions at
December 31, 2024
and
2023
, respectively, would impact our effective tax rate.
As a result of tax audit closings, settlements with tax authorities, and the expiration of applicable statutes of limitation in various
jurisdictions, it is reasonably possible that the liability for uncertain tax positions could be reduced by approximately
$
37
million
in the next
12 months.
For the years ended December 31,
2024

, net interest expense (income)
of

respectively, was recognized in our Provision for income taxes on our Combined Statement of Income (Loss).
Annually, we file over
2,600
income tax returns in over
270
global taxing jurisdictions. We are under examination or engaged in tax litigation
in many of these jurisdictions. The IRS is currently auditing the combined GE U.S. income tax returns for 2016-2021. In December 2020,
the IRS completed the audit of the combined GE U.S. income tax returns for 2014-2015. The Company has provided for its potential tax
exposure from uncertain tax positions as part of the combined GE U.S. income tax returns as an indemnification obligation with GE in
accordance with the Tax Matters Agreement.

SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION
.
We grant stock options, restricted stock units (RSUs), and performance share units
(PSUs) to employees under the 2024 Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP).
Under the LTIP, we are authorized to issue up to approximately
25
million
shares. We record compensation expense for awards expected to vest over the vesting period. We estimate forfeitures based on
experience and adjust expense to reflect actual forfeitures. When options are exercised, RSUs vest, and PSUs are earned, we issue
shares from authorized unissued common
stock
.
Stock options provide awardees the opportunity to purchase shares of GE Vernova common stock in the future at the market price of our
common stock on the date the award is granted (Strike price). The options become exercisable over the vesting period, typically becoming
fully vested in either
3
or
4
years
from the date of grant, and generally expire
10
years
from the grant date if not exercised. RSUs entitle the
awardee to receive shares of GE Vernova common stock upon vesting. PSUs entitle an awardee to receive shares of GE Vernova common
stock upon certification by the Company's Compensation and Human Capital Committee of the level of performance achievement of the
applicable performance metrics over a defined performance period. We value stock options using a Black-Scholes option pricing model,
RSUs using the market price of our common stock on the grant date, and PSUs using the market price of our common stock on the grant
date and a Monte Carlo simulation as needed based on performance metrics.
The following tables provide the weighted average fair value of options, RSUs, and PSUs granted under the 2024 LTIP to employees
during the nine months ended
December 31, 2024
and the related stock option valuation assumptions used in the Black-Scholes model.
For new awards granted in 2024,
the expected volatility
was derived from a peer group’s blended historical and implied volatility as GE
Vernova does not have sufficient historical volatility based on the expected term of the underlying options
.
The expected term of the stock
options was determined using the simplified method. The risk-free interest rate was determined using the implied yield currently available
for zero-coupon U.S. government issues with a remaining term approximating the expected life of the options.

, there were approximately
274
million
shares of GE Vernova
common stock outstanding. The computation of basic and diluted earnings (loss) per common share for all periods through
April 1, 2024
was calculated using
274
million
common shares and is net of Net loss (income) attributable to noncontrolling interests. For periods prior to
the Spin-Off, there were no dilutive equity instruments as there were no equity awards of GE Vernova outstanding prior to the Spin-Off. The
dilutive effect of outstanding stock options, restricted stock units, and performance share units is reflected in the denominator for diluted
EPS using the treasury stock method.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
Loans and Other Receivables.
The Company’s financial assets not carried at fair value primarily consist of loan receivables and
noncurrent customer and other receivables. The net carrying amount was
$
318
million
and
$
328
million
as of
December 31, 2024
and
2023, respectively. The estimated fair value was
$
315
million
and
$
324
million
as of
December 31, 2024
and 2023, respectively. All of these
assets are considered to be Level 3.
Derivatives and Hedging.
Our primary objective in executing and holding derivatives is to reduce the earnings and cash flow volatility
associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices over the terms of our customer contracts. These
hedge contracts reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the impact of foreign currency exchange rate and commodity price movements. The
Company does not enter into or hold derivative instruments for speculative trading purposes.
2024 FORM 10-K
78
We use foreign currency contracts to reduce the volatility of cash flows related to forecasted revenues, expenses, assets, and liabilities.
These contracts are generally
one
to
11
months
in duration but with maximum remaining maturities of up to
15
years
as of
December 31,
2024
. The objective of the foreign currency contracts is to ultimately reduce the extent to which functional currency or U.S. dollar-equivalent
cash flows are affected by changes in the applicable foreign currency exchange rates. We evaluate the effectiveness of our foreign
currency contracts designated as cash flow hedges on a quarterly basis.
The embedded derivatives the Company recognizes primarily consist of foreign currency related features in our purchase or sales contracts
where the currency is not the functional currency of either party to the contract.
Cash Flow Hedges.
For derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, changes in the fair value of designated hedging
instruments are initially recorded as a component of AOCI and subsequently reclassified to earnings in the period in which the hedged
transaction occurs and to the same financial statement line item impacted by the hedged forecasted transaction.
The total amount in AOCI related to cash flow hedges was a net
$
33
million
gain and a net
$
26
million
gain as of
December 31, 2024
and
2023
, respectively, of which a net
$
22
million
gain and a net
$
12
million
gain, respectively, related to our share of AOCI recognized at our
non-consolidated joint ventures. We expect to reclassify
$
45
million
of pre-tax net losses associated with designated cash flow hedges to
earnings in the next 12 months, contemporaneously with the earnings effects of the related forecasted transactions. The Company
reclassified net gains (losses) from AOCI into earnings of
$(
21
) million
,
$(
24
) million
and
$(
24
) million
for the
years ended
December 31,
2024
,
2023
, and
2022
,
respectively. As of
December 31, 2024
, the maximum length of time over which we are hedging forecasted
transactions was approximately
10
years
. The cash flows associated with cash flow hedges are recorded through the operating activities
section of the Consolidated and Combined Statement of Cash Flows. The Company assesses effectiveness for foreign currency cash flow
hedges related to long-term projects based on spot-to-spot foreign currency movements and excludes forward points from the assessment
of effectiveness.
Net Investment Hedges.
We enter into foreign exchange forwards designated as the hedging instruments in net investment hedging
relationships in order to mitigate the foreign currency risk attributable to the translation of the Company’s net investment in certain non
USD-functional subsidiaries and equity method investees. The total amount in AOCI related to net investment hedges was a net gain of
$
33
million
and
$
225
million
as of
December 31, 2024
and
2023
,
respectively.
The Company uses the spot method to assess hedge effectiveness for its net investment hedges. As such, for derivative instruments
designated as net investment hedges, changes in fair value of the designated hedging instruments attributable to fluctuations in foreign
currency spot exchange rates only are initially recorded as a component of the cumulative translation adjustments in AOCI until the hedged
investment is either sold or substantially liquidated. All other changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument are recognized in current
earnings.
Non-Designated Hedges. The Company also executes derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forward contracts and commodity
swaps, that are not designated in qualifying hedging relationships under U.S. GAAP. These derivatives are intended to serve as economic
hedges of foreign currency and commodity price risk, and depending on the derivative type, hedges of monetary assets and liabilities,
including intercompany balances subject to remeasurement.
The changes in fair value of non-designated hedges are recorded in line items in the Consolidated and Combined Statement of Income
(Loss) based on the nature of the derivative contract and the underlying item being economically hedged. The cash flows associated with
non-designated hedges are recorded in the same category as the cash flows from the items being economically hedged and are thus
primarily through investing and operating activities of the Consolidated and Combined Statement of Cash Flows.
The following table presents the gross fair values of our outstanding derivative instruments as of the dates indicated:
GROSS FAIR VALUE OF OUTSTANDING DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS

Counterparty Credit Risk.
The Company would be exposed to credit-related losses in the event of non-performance by counterparties on
executed derivative instruments. The credit exposure of derivative contracts is represented by the fair value of contracts as of the reporting
date. The fair value of the Company’s derivatives can change significantly from period to period based on, among other factors, market
movements, and changes in our positions.
We manage concentration of counterparty credit risk by limiting acceptable counterparties to major financial institutions with investment
grade credit ratings, by limiting the amount of credit exposure to individual counterparties, and by actively monitoring counterparty credit
ratings and the amount of individual credit exposure.
We also employ master netting arrangements that limit the risk of counterparty non-payment on a particular settlement date to the net gain
that would have otherwise been received from the counterparty. Although not completely eliminated, we do not consider the risk of
counterparty default to be significant as a result of these protections. Further, none of our derivative instruments are subject to collateral or
other security arrangements, nor do they contain provisions that are dependent on our credit ratings from any credit rating agency.

and liabilities of
$
134
million
and
$
156
million
as of

consolidated
VIEs
. These entities were created to help our customers facilitate or finance the purchase of GE Vernova equipment and
services, and to manage our insurance exposure through an insurance captive, and have no features that could expose us to losses that
would significantly exceed the difference between the consolidated assets and liabilities.
Our investments in unconsolidated VIEs were
$
90
million
and
$
1,323
million
as of
December 31, 2024

substantially all related to renewable energy U.S. tax equity investments
that
were subsequently retained by GE in connection with the Spin-Off

Commitments.
We had total investment commitments of

at December 31,
2024. The commitments primarily consist of obligations to make investments in or provide funding by our Financial Services and Gas
Power businesses. See Note

Guarantees
.
As of December 31, 2024, we were committed under the following guarantee arrangements:
Credit
support
.
We have provided
$
699
million
of credit support on behalf of certain customers or associated companies, predominantly
joint ventures and partnerships, using arrangements such as standby letters of credit and performance guarantees, and a line of credit to
support our consolidated subsidiaries. The liability for such credit support was
$
6
million
.
In addition, prior to the Spin-Off, GE provided
parent company guarantees to GE Vernova in certain jurisdictions.
See Note
24
for further information.
Indemnification agreements
.
We have
$
882
million
of indemnification commitments, including obligations arising from the Spin-Off, our
commercial contracts, and agreements governing the sale of business assets, for which we recorded a liability of
$
514
million
. The liability
is primarily associated with cash deposits, of which
$
325
million
relates to cash transferred to the Company from GE as part of the Spin-Off
that is restricted in connection with certain legal matters related to legacy GE operations. The liability reflects the use of these funds to
settle any associated obligations and the return of any remaining cash to GE in a future reporting period once resolved. In addition, the
liability includes
$
140
million
of indemnifications in connection with agreements entered into with GE related to the Spin-Off, including the
Tax Matters Agreement.
Product Warranties.
We provide for estimated product warranty expenses when we sell the related products. Because warranty estimates
are forecasts that are based on the best available information, mostly historical claims experience, claims costs may differ from amounts
provided.
An analysis of changes in the liability for product warranties follows.
(a)
The increase in current- and prior-year provisions is primarily related to our Wind segment, which, in 2022, was substantially all due to
changes in estimates on pre-existing warranties and related to the deployment of repairs and other corrective measures in
Onshore
Wind
.

6,000
million
of credit facilities consisting of (i) a
five
-year
unsecured revolving credit facility in an aggregate
committed amount of
$
3,000
million
(the “Revolving Credit Facility”) provided pursuant to a credit agreement, dated as of March 26, 2024
and (ii) a standby letter of credit and bank guarantee facility in an aggregate committed amount of
$
3,000
million
(the “Trade Finance
Facility” and, together with the Revolving Credit Facility, the “Credit Facilities”). The Revolving Credit Facility is available for borrowings in
U.S. dollars and euros. Up to
$
500
million
of the Revolving Credit Facility is available for the issuance of letters of credit. There were
no
borrowings outstanding on this facility as of December 31, 2024. The Trade Finance Facility will be available for the issuance of standby
letters of credit and bank guarantees in U.S. dollars, euros and various other currencies. The Trade Finance Facility has not been utilized
as of December 31, 2024. Each of the Credit Facilities will mature on April 2, 2029. We may voluntarily prepay borrowings under the
Revolving Credit Facility without premium or penalty, subject to customary breakage costs with respect to loans bearing interest by
reference to the applicable adjusted Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate (Term SOFR) or the Euro Interbank Offered Rate (Euribor).
2024 FORM 10-K

We may also voluntarily reduce the commitments under the Credit Facilities, in whole or in part, subject to certain minimum reduction
amounts. The Credit Facilities include various customary covenants that limit, among other things, our incurrence of liens and our entry into
certain fundamental change transactions. Fees related to the unused portion of the facilities were not material in the year ended December
31, 2024.
Legal Matters.
I
n the normal course of our business, we are regularly involved in various arbitrations, class actions, commercial litigation,
investigations, or other legal, regulatory, or governmental actions, including the significant matters described below, that could have a
material impact on our results of operations. In many proceedings, including the specific matters described below, it is inherently difficult to
determine whether any loss is probable or even reasonably possible or to estimate the size or range of the possible loss, and accruals for
legal matters are not recorded until a loss for a particular matter is considered probable and reasonably estimable. Given the nature of legal
matters and the complexities involved, it is often difficult to predict and determine a meaningful estimate of loss or range of loss until we
know, among other factors, the particular claims involved, the likelihood of success of our defenses to those claims, the damages or other
relief sought, how discovery or other procedural considerations will affect the outcome, the settlement posture of other parties, and other
factors that may have a material effect on the outcome. For these matters, unless otherwise specified, we do not believe it is possible to
provide a meaningful estimate of loss at this time. Moreover, it is not uncommon for legal matters to be resolved over many years, during
which time relevant developments and new information must be continuously evaluated.
Alstom
legacy legal matters.
In November 2015, we acquired the power and grid businesses of Alstom, which prior to the acquisition was
the subject of significant cases involving anti-competitive activities and improper payments. The estimated liability balance was
$
236
million
and
$
393
million
at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, for legal and compliance matters related to the legacy business practices
that were the subject of cases in various jurisdictions. Allegations in these cases relate to claimed anticompetitive conduct or improper
payments in the pre-acquisition period as the source of legal violations or damages. Given the significant litigation and compliance activity
related to these matters and our ongoing efforts to resolve them, it is difficult to assess whether the disbursements will ultimately be
consistent with the estimated liability established. The estimation of this liability may not reflect the full range of uncertainties and
unpredictable outcomes inherent in litigation and investigations of this nature, and at this time we are unable to develop a meaningful
estimate of the range of reasonably possible additional losses beyond the amount of this estimated liability. Factors that can affect the
ultimate amount of losses associated with these and related matters include formulas for determining disgorgement, fines and/or penalties,
the duration and amount of legal and investigative resources applied, political and social influences within each jurisdiction, and tax
consequences of any settlements or previous deductions, among other considerations. Actual losses arising from claims in these and
related matters could exceed the amount provided.
In June 2024, we executed a settlement agreement with the Government of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, represented by The Ministry of
Energy (MOE) in connection with certain Alstom steam power construction projects with Saudi Electric Company (SE) won between 1998
and 2008. In November 2015, prior to its acquisition by GE, Alstom had paid a fine and pled guilty to charges brought by the U.S.
Department of Justice under the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, including in relation to conduct related to
two
of these SE steam power
projects. In December 2015, following the acquisition of Alstom by GE, SE contacted GE seeking recompense for alleged reputational
damage and in December 2021, the Saudi Arabia National Anti-Corruption Commission became involved and initiated an investigation. The
settlement of approximately
$
267
million
consists of
$
141
million
in cash payments to the MOE and the remainder as a credit note to SE,
and releases GE Vernova, GE and their respective affiliates from civil and criminal liabilities related to this matter after the settlement
obligations are met. The entire cash settlement of
$
141
million
has been paid as of December 31, 2024.
Environmental and Asset Retirement Obligations.
Our operations involve the use, disposal, and cleanup of substances regulated under
environmental protection laws and nuclear decommissioning regulations. We have obligations for ongoing and future environmental
remediation activities and may incur additional liabilities in connection with previously remediated sites. Additionally, like many other
industrial companies, we and our subsidiaries are defendants in various lawsuits related to alleged worker exposure to asbestos or other
hazardous materials. Liabilities for environmental remediation, nuclear decommissioning, and worker exposure claims exclude possible
insurance recoveries.
It is reasonably possible that our exposure will exceed amounts accrued. However, due to uncertainties about the status of laws,
regulations, technology, and information related to individual sites and lawsuits, such amounts are not reasonably estimable. Our reserves
related to environmental remediation and worker exposure claims recorded in All other liabilities were
$
138
million
and
$
127
million
as of
December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
We record asset retirement obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets as a liability in the period in which the
obligation is incurred and its fair value can be reasonably estimated. These obligations primarily represent nuclear decommissioning, legal
obligations to return leased premises to their initial state or dismantle and repair specific alterations for certain leased sites. The liability is
measured at the present value of the obligation when incurred and is adjusted in subsequent periods. Corresponding asset retirement costs
are capitalized as part of
the carrying value of the related long-lived assets and depreciated over the asset’s useful life. Our asset
retirement obligations were
$
622
million
and
$
581
million
as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and are recorded in All other
current liabilities and All other liabilities in our Consolidated and Combined Statement of Financial Position.
Of these amounts,
$
546
million
and
$
519
million
were related to
nuclear decommissioning obligations. Changes in the liability balance due to settlement, accretion, and
revisions in fair value were not material
during
the year ended December 31, 2024.
Expenditures for nuclear decommissioning, site remediation, and worker exposure claims we
re
$
11
million
,
$
14
million
, and
$
19
million
, for
the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. We presently expect that such expenditures will be approximately
$
13
million
and
$
11
million
in 2025 and 2026, respectively.

RESTRUCTURING CHARGES AND SEPARATION COSTS
Restructuring and Other Charges.
The Company has undertaken or committed to various restructuring initiatives, including workforce
reductions and the consolidation of manufacturing and service facilities. Restructuring and other charges primarily include employee-related
2024 FORM 10-K
82
termination benefits associated with workforce reductions, facility exit costs, asset write-down
s, an
d cease-use costs. We expect the
majority of costs to be incurred within
two years
of the commitment of a restructuring initiative.
This table is inclusive of all restructuring charges and the charges are shown below for the business where they originated. Separately, in
our reported segment results, major restructuring programs are excluded from measurement of segment operating performance for internal
and external purposes; those excluded amounts are reported in Restructuring and other charges. See Note
25
for further information.
(a) Includes
$
248
million
,
$
227
million
, and
$
203
million
for the
years ended
December 31, 2024
,
2023
, and 2022, respectively, primarily of
non-cash impairment, accelerated depreciation, and other charges not reflected in the liability table below.
Liabilities associated with restructuring activities were recorded in All other current liabilities, All other liabilities, and Non-current
compensation and benefits.
In addition to the continued impacts of ongoing initiatives, restructuring primarily included exit activities associated with previously
announced plans in October 2022 primarily reflecting the selectivity strategy to operate in fewer markets and to simplify and standardize
product variants across our Wind businesses. The estimated cost of this multi-year restructuring program was approximately
$
600
million
.
This plan was expanded during the third quarter of 2023 to include the consolidation of the global footprint and related resources at our
Power businesses to better serve our customers. In the third quarter of 2024, in order to transform and optimize our global footprint, we
announced the restructuring of our Hydro Power business,
as a result of which we recogn
ized
$
155
million
of charges, which is the vast
majority of the estimated cost of this program. The costs incurred in the year ended December 31, 2024 primarily relates to a non-cash pre-
tax impairment charge of property, plant, and equipment. See Note
6
for further information.
Separation Costs.
In connection with the Spin-Off, the Company
recognized s
eparation costs (benefits) of
$(
9
) million
for the year ended
December 31, 2024
in our Consolidated and Combined Statement of Income (Loss). Separation costs (benefits) include system
implementations, advisory fees, one-time stock option grant, and other one-time costs, which are primarily recorded in Selling, general, and
administrative costs. I
n addition, in connection with GE retaining certain renewable energy U.S. tax equity investments as part of the Spin-
Off, the Company recognized a
$
136
million
benefit in the second quarter related to deferred intercompany profit from historical equipment
sales to the related investees, recorded in Cost of equipment.

RELATED PARTIES
Aero Alliance.
Aero Alliance is our joint venture with
Baker Hughes Company
that supports our customers through the fulfillment of
aeroderivative engines, spare parts, repairs, and maintenance services. Purchases of parts and services from the joint venture were
$
651
million
,
$
656
million
, and
$
521
million
for the
years ended
December 31, 2024
,
2023
, and 2022, respectively. The Company owed
Aero Alliance
$
24
million
and
$
34
million
as of
December 31, 2024
and 2023, respectively. These amounts have been recorded in Due to
related parties on the Consolidated and Combined Statement of Financial Position.
Financial Services Investments.
Our Financial Services business invests in project infrastructure entities where we do not hold a
controlling financial interest. These entities generally purchase equipment from our Wind and Power segments, and we have recognized
revenues of
$
4
million
,
$
168
million
, and
$
810
million
for the
years ended
December 31, 2024
,
2023
, and 2022, respectively, for sales to
these entities. Revenues for sales to these entities for the year ended
December 31, 2024
were
no
t significant as GE retained the
renewable energy U.S. tax equity investments. See Note
11
for further information.
Allocations From GE.
Prior to the Spin-Off,
GE historically provided the Company with significant corporate, infrastructure, and shared
services. Some of these services continue to be provided by GE to the Company on a temporary basis following the Spin-Off under the
Transition Services Agreement. Accordingly, for periods prior to the Spin-Off, certain GE corporate costs have been charged to the
Company based on allocation methodologies as follows:
2024 FORM 10-K
83
a.
Centralized services such as public relations, investor relations, treasury and cash management, executive management, security,
government relations, community outreach, and corporate internal audit services were charged to the Company on a pro rata
basis of GE’s estimates of each business’s usage at the beginning of the fiscal year and were recorded in Selling, general, and
administrative expenses. Costs of
$
67
million
and
$
70
million
for the
years ended
December 31, 2023
and 2022, respectively,
were recorded in our Consolidated and Combined Statement of Income (Loss). Costs allocated to the Company for the three
months ended
March 31, 2024
were
no
t significant as GE Vernova had established standalone capabilities for such services.
b.
Information technology, finance, insurance, research, supply chain, human resources, tax, and facilities activities were charged to
the Company based on headcount, revenue, or other allocation methodologies. Costs for these services of
$
711
million
and
$
772
million
were charged to the Company for the
years ended
December 31, 2023
and 2022
, respectively. Costs for these
services of
$
100
million
were charged to the Company for the
three months ended
March 31, 2024
. Such costs
are primarily
included in Selling, general, and administrative expenses and Research and development expenses in our Consolidated and
Combined Statement of Income (Loss).
c.
Costs associated with employee medical insurance totaling
$
133
million
and
$
114
million
were charged for the
years ended
December 31, 2023
and 2022
, respectively. Costs associated with employee medical insurance totaling
$
30
million
were charged
to the Company for the
three months ended
March 31, 2024
. Costs
were charged to the Company based on employee headcount
and are recorded in Cost of equipment, Cost of services, Selling, general, and administrative expenses, or Research and
development expenses in our Consolidated and Combined Statement of Income (Loss) based on the employee population.
Prior to January 1, 2023, employees of the Company participated in pensions and benefits plans that were sponsored by GE. The
Company was charged
$
64
million
for the year ended December 31, 2022. These costs are charged directly to the Company based on
specific employee eligibility for those benefits. On January 1, 2023, these pension plans were legally split and allocated to GE Vernova and
are accounted for as multiemployer plans starting in 2023. See Note
13
for further information.
Additionally, GE granted various employee benefits to its employees, including prior to the Spin-Off to those of the Company, under the GE
Long-Term Incentive Plan. These benefits primarily included stock options and restricted stock units. Compensation expense associated
with this plan was
$
118
million
and
$
123
million
for the
years ended
December 31, 2023
and 2022
, respectively. Compensation expense
associated with this plan was
$
34
million
for the
three months ended
March 31, 2024
. Such expense is included
primarily in Selling,
general, and administrative expenses in our Consolidated and Combined Statement of Income (Loss). These costs were charged directly to
the Company based on the specific employees receiving awards.
Finally, while GE’s third-party debt had not been attributed to the Company, GE allocated a portion of interest expense related to its third-
party debt for funding provided by GE to the Company for certain investments held by Financial Services. The interest was allocated based
on the GE-funded ending net investment position each reporting period. Interest allocated was
$
35
million
and
$
46
million
for the
years
ended
December 31, 2023
and 2022, respectively. Interest allocated
was
$
7
million
for the
three months ended
March 31, 2024
. Such
expense
is included in Interest and other financial charges – net in our Consolidated and Combined Statement of Income (Loss).
Management believes that the expense and cost allocations were determined on a basis that is a reasonable reflection of the utilization of
services provided or the benefit received by the Company. The amounts that would have been, or will be incurred, on a stand-alone basis
could materially differ from the amounts allocated due to economies of scale, difference in management judgment, a requirement for more
or fewer employees, or other factors. Management does not believe, however, that it is practicable to estimate what these expenses would
have been had the Company operated as an independent entity, including any expenses associated with obtaining any of these services
from unaffiliated entities. In addition, the future results of operations, financial position, and cash flows could differ materially from the
historical results presented herein.
Parent Company Credit Support.
GE provided the Company with parent credit support in certain jurisdictions. To support the Company in
selling products and services globally, GE often entered into contracts on behalf of GE Vernova or issued parent company guarantees or
trade finance instruments supporting the performance of what were subsidiary legal entities transacting directly with customers, in addition
to providing similar credit support for some non-customer related activities of GE Vernova. There are no known instances historically where
payments or performance from GE were required under parent company guarantees relating to GE Vernova customer contracts.
Tran
sfer of Tax Credits
to GE.
Under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which went into effect in 2023, we generate advanced
manufacturing credits in our Wind business.
These credits are transferable and are not reliant on a tax liability to be realized.
During the
first quarter of 2024, we received cash of
$
249
million
from GE for credits generated prior to the Spin-Off. See Note
11
f
or further
information regarding production tax credits transferred to GE.

SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION
Operating segments include components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly
by the Company’s Chief
Operating Dec
ision Maker (CODM) for the purpose of assessing performance and allocating resources. The
Company’s CODM is its Chief Executive Officer (CEO). Our operating activities are managed through
three
segments: Power, Wind, and
Electrification. These segments have been identified based on the nature of the products and services sold and how the Company
manages its operations.
The performance of these segments is principally measured based on revenues and segment EBITDA. Segment EBITDA is determined
based on the performance measures used by our CEO to assess the performance of each business in a given period. In connection with
that assessment, the CEO may exclude matters, such as charges for impairments, significant higher-cost restructuring programs,
manufacturing footprint rationalization and other similar expenses, acquisition costs and other related charges, certain gains and losses
from acquisitions or dispositions and certain other non-operational items.
Consistent accounting policies have been applied by all segments for all reporting periods. See Note
1
for a
description of our reportable
segments.

Management’s Discussion of Financial Responsibility.
Management is responsible for the preparation of the consolidated and
combined financial statements and related information that are presented in this report. The consolidated and combined financial

The Company designs and maintains accounting and internal control systems to provide reasonable assurance that assets are
safeguarded against loss from unauthorized use or disposition, and that the financial records are reliable for preparing consolidated and
combined financial statements and maintaining accountability for assets. These systems are enhanced by policies and procedures, an
organizational structure providing division of responsibilities, careful selection and training of qualified personnel, and a program of internal
audits.
The Board of Directors, through its Audit Committee, which consists entirely of independent directors, meets periodically with management,
internal auditors, and our independent registered public accounting firm to ensure that each is meeting its responsibilities and to discuss
matters concerning internal controls and financial reporting. Deloitte and Touche LLP and the internal auditors each have full and free
