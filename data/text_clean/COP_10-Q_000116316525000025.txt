Note 1—Basis of Presentation
The interim-period financial information presented in the financial statements included in this report is unaudited and, in the opinion of management, includes all known accruals and adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the consolidated financial position of ConocoPhillips, its results of operations and cash flows for such periods. All such adjustments are of a normal and recurring nature unless otherwise disclosed. Certain notes and other information have been condensed or omitted from the interim financial statements included in this report; therefore, these financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes included in our 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Certain prior year financial statement line items have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.

Note 3—Acquisitions and Dispositions
Acquisition of Marathon Oil Corporation (Marathon Oil)
In November 2024, we completed our acquisition of Marathon Oil, an independent oil and gas exploration and production company with operations across the Lower 48 and in Equatorial Guinea. At close, the transaction was valued at $
16.5
billion, which primarily represented
0.255
shares of ConocoPhillips common stock exchanged for each outstanding share of Marathon Oil common stock.
*Represents the fair value of approximately
143
million shares of ConocoPhillips common stock issued to Marathon Oil stockholders. The fair value is based on the number of eligible shares of Marathon Oil common stock at a
0.255
exchange ratio and ConocoPhillips' average stock price on November 22, 2024, which was $
111.93
.
**Cash transferred at close primarily represents funds contributed to Marathon Oil for repayment of Marathon Oil's estimated commercial paper liabilities as of the closing date.
***Liabilities incurred are related to cash settled share-based awards and payment of cash in lieu of fractional Marathon Oil shares outstanding.
The transaction was accounted for as a business combination under FASB Topic ASC 805 using the acquisition method, which requires assets acquired and liabilities assumed to be measured at their acquisition date fair values. Fair value measurements were made for acquired assets and liabilities. Adjustments to those measurements may be made in subsequent periods, up to one year from the acquisition date, as we identify new information about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date to consider. At March 31, 2025, remaining items to finalize include allocation of fair value to unproved properties. The impact of finalizing the fair value allocation is not expected to have a material impact to our consolidated financial statements.
Oil and gas properties were valued using a discounted cash flow approach incorporating market participant and internally generated price assumptions; production profiles; and operating and development cost assumptions. Debt assumed in the acquisition was valued based on observable market prices. The fair values of accounts receivable, accounts payable, and most other current assets and current liabilities were determined to be equivalent to the carrying value due to their short-term nature. The acquisition, valued at $
16.5
billion, was allocated to the identifiable assets and liabilities based on their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date of November 22, 2024.
With the completion of the transaction, we acquired proved properties of approximately $
13
billion, with $
12
billion in Lower 48 and $
1
billion in Equatorial Guinea, and unproved properties of $
11
billion in Lower 48.
We recognized approximately $
568
million pre-tax of transaction-related costs to date, inclusive of $
23
million in the first quarter of 2025. These non-recurring costs related primarily to employee severance and related benefits, fees paid to advisors and the settlement of share-based awards for certain Marathon Oil employees based on the terms of the Merger Agreement.
Supplemental Pro Forma (unaudited)
The following table summarizes the unaudited supplemental pro forma financial information for the three-month period ended March 31, 2024, as if we had completed the acquisition on January 1, 2023.
The unaudited supplemental pro forma financial information is presented for illustration purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of the operating results that would have occurred had the transaction been completed on January 1, 2023, nor is it necessarily indicative of future operating results of the combined entity. The pro forma results do not include cost savings anticipated as a result of the transaction. The pro forma results include adjustments which relate primarily to DD&A, which is based on the unit-of-production method, resulting from the purchase price allocated to oil and gas properties as well as adjustments for tax impacts. We believe the estimates and assumptions are reasonable, and the relative effects of the transaction are properly reflected.
Assets Sold
In the first quarter of 2025, we sold our interests in certain noncore assets in the Lower 48 segment for net proceeds of $
581
million and recognized a $
64
million before-tax and $
49
million after-tax gain. At the time of disposition, our interest in these assets had a net carrying value of $
517
million, comprised primarily of $
553
million of PP&E and $
36
million of liabilities, primarily related to noncurrent AROs.
Assets Held for Sale
In February 2025, we entered into an agreement to sell our interests in the Ursa and Europa Fields, and Ursa Oil Pipeline Company LLC to Shell Offshore Inc. and Shell Pipeline Company LP, respectively, for $
735
million subject to customary closing adjustments. These assets, in our Lower 48 segment, have a net carrying value of approximately $
394
million, comprised primarily of $
496
million of PP&E and $
102
million of liabilities, primarily related to noncurrent AROs. These assets met held for sale criteria in the first quarter of 2025, and as of March 31, 2025, we reclassified the PP&E to "Prepaid expenses and other current assets" and the noncurrent liabilities to "Other accruals" on our consolidated balance sheet. This transaction closed in May 2025. For tax-related impacts of this disposition,
see Note
19
.
Contingent Payments
In October 2023, we completed our acquisition of the remaining
50
percent working interest in Surmont, an asset in our Canada segment, from TotalEnergies EP Canada Ltd. The consideration for the acquisition contained a contingent consideration arrangement that requires additional consideration to be paid to TotalEnergies EP Canada Ltd. up to $
0.4
billion CAD over a
five-year
term. The contingent payments represent $
2
million for every dollar that WCS pricing exceeds $
52
per barrel during the month, subject to certain production targets being achieved. The undiscounted amount we could pay under this arrangement was up to $
0.3
billion USD at closing. The fair value of the contingent consideration on the acquisition date was $
320
million and estimated by applying the income approach. Since the acquisition, we have made payments of $
197
million USD under this arrangement, included in the "Other" line within the Financing Activities section of our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.

Note 4—Investments and Long-Term Receivables
Australia Pacific LNG Pty Ltd. (APLNG)
In Australia, we hold a
47.5
percent shareholding interest in APLNG. At March 31, 2025, the outstanding balance of APLNG's debt was $
3.7
billion under various previously entered facilities. The last principal and interest payment on these facilities is due in September 2030.
See Note
8
.
At March 31, 2025, the carrying value of our equity method investment in APLNG was approximately $
5.0
billion.
Port Arthur LNG (PALNG)
We hold a
30
percent direct equity investment in PALNG, a joint venture for the development of a large-scale LNG facility. At March 31, 2025, the carrying value of our equity method investment in PALNG was approximately $
1.6
billion.
Qatar LNG
Our equity method investments in Qatar include the following:
•
QatarEnergy LNG N(3) (N3)—
30
percent owned joint venture with an affiliate of QatarEnergy (
68.5
percent) and Mitsui & Co., Ltd. (
1.5
percent)—produces and liquefies natural gas from Qatar’s North Field, as well as exports LNG.
•
QatarEnergy LNG NFE(4) (NFE4)—
25
percent owned joint venture with affiliates of QatarEnergy (
70
percent) and China National Petroleum Corporation (
5
percent)—participant in the North Field East LNG project.
•
QatarEnergy LNG NFS(3) (NFS3)—
25
percent owned joint venture with an affiliate of QatarEnergy (
75
percent)—participant in the North Field South LNG project.
At March 31, 2025, the carrying value of our equity method investments in Qatar was approximately $
1.4
billion.
Note 5—Debt
Our debt balanc
e at March 31, 2025 was $
23.8
billion, compared with $
24.3
billion at December 31, 2024
.
In the first quarter of 2025, the company retired a total of $
0.5
billion principal amount of debt at maturity, consisting of $
0.4
billion of our
2.4
% Notes and $
0.1
billion of our
8.2
% Debentures.
In February 2025, we refinanced our revolving credit facility maintaining a total aggregate principal amount of $
5.5
billion and extended the expiration to February 2030. Our revolving credit facility may be used for direct bank borrowings, the issuance of letters of credit totaling up to $
500
million, or as support for our commercial paper program. The revolving credit facility is broadly syndicated among financial institutions and does not contain any material adverse change provisions or any covenants requiring maintenance of specified financial ratios or credit ratings. The facility agreement contains a cross-default provision relating to the failure to pay principal or interest on other debt obligations of $
200
million or more by ConocoPhillips, or any of its consolidated subsidiaries. The amount of the facility is not subject to redetermination prior to its expiration date.
Credit facility borrowings may bear interest at a margin above the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR). The facility agreement calls for commitment fees on available, but unused, amounts. The facility agreement also contains early termination rights if our current directors or their approved successors cease to be a majority of the Board of Directors.
The revolving credit facility supports our ability to issue up to $
5.5
billion of commercial paper. Commercial paper is generally limited to maturities of 90 days and is included in short-term debt on our consolidated balance sheet. With no commercial paper outstanding and no direct borrowings or letters of credit, we had access to $
5.5
billion in available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility at March 31, 2025, and at December 31, 2024.
We do not have any ratings triggers on any of our corporate debt that would cause an automatic default and thereby impact our access to liquidity upon downgrade of our credit ratings. If our credit ratings are downgraded from their current levels, it could increase the cost of corporate debt available to us and restrict our access to the commercial paper markets. If our credit ratings were to deteriorate to a level prohibiting us from accessing the commercial paper market, we would still be able to access funds under our revolving credit facility.
At March 31, 2025, we had $
283
million of certain variable rate demand bonds (VRDBs) outstanding with maturities ranging through 2035. The VRDBs are redeemable at the option of the bondholders on any business day. If they are ever redeemed, we have the ability and intent to refinance on a long-term basis; therefore, the VRDBs are included in the “Long-term debt” line on our consolidated balance sheet.
Note 6—Changes in Equity
Note 7—Suspended Wells and Exploration Expenses
The capitalized cost of suspended wells at March 31, 2025 was $
161
million, a decrease of $
35
million from December 31, 2024. In the first quarter of 2025, we recognized dry hole expenses of $
36
million related to certain previously suspended wells that were capitalized for a period greater than one year in our Asia Pacific segment
.
Note 8—Guarantees
At March 31, 2025, we were liable for certain contingent obligations under various contractual arrangements as described below. We recognize a liability, at inception, for the fair value of our obligation as a guarantor for newly issued or modified guarantees. Unless the carrying amount of the liability is noted below, we have not recognized a liability because the fair value of the obligation is immaterial. In addition, unless otherwise stated, we are not currently performing with any significance under the guarantee and expect future performance to be either immaterial or have only a remote chance of occurrence.
APLNG Guarantees
At March 31, 2025, we had outstanding multiple guarantees in connection with our
47.5
percent ownership interest in APLNG. The following is a description of the guarantees with values calculated utilizing March 2025 exchange rates:
•
During the third quarter of 2016, we issued a guarantee to facilitate the withdrawal of our pro-rata portion of the funds in a project finance reserve account. We estimate the remaining term of this guarantee to be
six years
. Our maximum exposure under this guarantee is approximately $
210
million and may become payable if an enforcement action is commenced by the project finance lenders against APLNG. At March 31, 2025, the carrying value of this guarantee was approximately $
14
million.
•
In conjunction with our original purchase of an ownership interest in APLNG from Origin Energy Limited in October 2008, we agreed to reimburse Origin Energy Limited for our share of the existing contingent liability arising under guarantees of an existing obligation of APLNG to deliver natural gas under several sales agreements. The final guarantee expires in the fourth quarter of 2041. Our maximum potential liability for future payments, or cost of volume delivery, under these guarantees is estimated to be $
600
million ($
1.0
billion in the event of intentional or reckless breach) and would become payable if APLNG fails to meet its obligations under these agreements and the obligations cannot otherwise be mitigated. Future payments are considered unlikely, as the payments, or cost of volume delivery, would only be triggered if APLNG does not have enough natural gas to meet these sales commitments and if the co-venturers do not make necessary equity contributions into APLNG.
•
We have guaranteed the performance of APLNG with regard to certain other contracts executed in connection with the project’s continued development. The guarantees have remaining terms of
12
to
21
years or the life of the venture. Our maximum potential amount of future payments related to these guarantees is approximately $
570
million and would become payable if APLNG does not perform. At March 31, 2025, the carrying value of these guarantees was approximately $
39
million.
QatarEnergy LNG Guarantees
We have guaranteed our portion of certain fiscal and other joint venture obligations as a shareholder in NFE4 and NFS3. These guarantees have an approximate
30
-year term with no maximum limit. At March 31, 2025, the carrying value of these guarantees was approximately $
14
million.
Equatorial Guinea Guarantees
We have guaranteed payment obligations as a shareholder in both Equatorial Guinea LNG Operations, S.A., a fully owned subsidiary of Equatorial Guinea LNG Holdings Limited, and Alba Plant LLC with regard to certain agreements to process third-party gas.
These guarantees have
three years
remaining, and the maximum potential future payments related to these guarantees is approximately $
116
million. At March 31, 2025, the carrying value of these guarantees was approximately $
4
million.
Other Guarantees
We have other guarantees with maximum future potential payment amounts totaling approximately $
570
million, which consist primarily of guarantees of the residual value of leased office buildings and guarantees of the residual value of corporate aircraft. These guarantees have remaining terms of
one
to
five years
and would become payable if certain asset values are lower than guaranteed amounts at the end of the lease or contract term, business conditions decline at guaranteed entities or as a result of nonperformance of contractual terms by guaranteed parties. At March 31, 2025, there was no carrying value associated with these guarantees.
Indemnifications
Over the years, we have entered into agreements to sell ownership interests in certain legal entities, joint ventures and assets that gave rise to qualifying indemnifications. These agreements include indemnifications for taxes and environmental liabilities. The carrying amount recorded for these indemnification obligations at March 31, 2025, was approximately $
20
million. Those related to environmental issues have terms that are generally indefinite, and the maximum amounts of future payments are generally unlimited. Although it is reasonably possible future payments may exceed amounts recorded, due to the nature of the indemnifications, it is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential amount of future payments.
See Note
9
for additional information about environmental liabilities.
Note 9—Contingencies, Commitments and Accrued Environmental Costs
A number of lawsuits involving a variety of claims arising in the ordinary course of business have been filed against ConocoPhillips. We also may be required to remove or mitigate the effects on the environment of the placement, storage, disposal or release of certain chemical, mineral and petroleum substances at various active and inactive sites. We regularly assess the need for accounting recognition or disclosure of these contingencies. In the case of all known contingencies (other than those related to income taxes), we accrue a liability when the loss is probable and the amount is reasonably estimable. If a range of amounts can be reasonably estimated and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount, then the low end of the range is accrued. We do not reduce these liabilities for potential insurance or third-party recoveries. We accrue receivables for insurance or other third-party recoveries when applicable. With respect to income tax-related contingencies, we use a cumulative probability-weighted loss accrual in cases where sustaining a tax position is less than certain.
Based on currently available information, we believe it is remote that future costs related to known contingent liability exposures will exceed current accruals by an amount that would have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements. As we learn new facts concerning contingencies, we reassess our position both with respect to accrued liabilities and other potential exposures. Estimates particularly sensitive to future changes include contingent liabilities recorded for environmental remediation, tax and legal matters. Estimated future environmental remediation costs are subject to change due to such factors as the uncertain magnitude of cleanup costs, the unknown time and extent of such remedial actions that may be required, and the determination of our liability in proportion to that of other responsible parties. Estimated future costs related to tax and legal matters are subject to change as events evolve and as additional information becomes available during the administrative and litigation processes.
Environmental
We are subject to international, federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations and record accruals for environmental liabilities based on management’s best estimates. These estimates are based on currently available facts, existing technology and presently enacted laws and regulations, taking into account stakeholder and business considerations. When measuring environmental liabilities, we also consider our prior experience in remediation of contaminated sites, other companies’ cleanup experience and data released by the U.S. EPA or other organizations. We consider unasserted claims in our determination of environmental liabilities, and we accrue them in the period they are both probable and reasonably estimable.
Although liability of those potentially responsible for environmental remediation costs is generally joint and several for federal sites and frequently so for other sites, we are usually only one of many companies cited at a particular site. Due to the joint and several liabilities, we could be responsible for all cleanup costs related to any site at which we have been designated as a potentially responsible party. We have been successful to date in sharing cleanup costs with other financially sound companies. Many of the sites at which we are potentially responsible are still under investigation by the U.S. EPA or the agency concerned. Prior to actual cleanup, those potentially responsible normally assess the site conditions, apportion responsibility and determine the appropriate remediation. In some instances, we may have no liability or may attain a settlement of liability. Where it appears that other potentially responsible parties may be financially unable to bear their proportional share, we consider this inability in estimating our potential liability, and we adjust our accruals accordingly. As a result of various acquisitions in the past, we assumed certain environmental obligations. Some of these environmental obligations are mitigated by indemnifications made by others for our benefit, and some of the indemnifications are subject to dollar limits and time limits.
We are currently participating in environmental assessments and cleanups at numerous federal Superfund and other comparable state and international sites. After an assessment of environmental exposures for cleanup and other costs, we make accruals on an undiscounted basis (except those acquired in a purchase business combination, which we record on a discounted basis) for planned investigation and remediation activities for sites where it is probable future costs will be incurred and these costs can be reasonably estimated. We have not reduced these accruals for possible insurance recoveries.
For remediation activities in the U.S. and Canada, our consolidated balance sheet included total accrued environmental costs of $
210
million at March 31, 2025 compared with $
206
million at December 31, 2024. We expect to incur a substantial amount of these expenditures within the next
30
years. In the future, we may be involved in additional environmental assessments, cleanups and proceedings.
Litigation and Other Contingencies
We are subject to various lawsuits and claims including, but not limited to, matters involving oil and gas royalty and severance tax payments, gas measurement and valuation methods, contract disputes, environmental damages, climate change, personal injury and property damage. Our primary exposures for such matters relate to alleged royalty and tax underpayments on certain federal, state and privately owned properties, claims of alleged environmental contamination and damages from historic operations and climate change. We will continue to defend ourselves vigorously in these matters.
Our legal organization applies its knowledge, experience and professional judgment to the specific characteristics of our cases, employing a litigation management process to manage and monitor the legal proceedings against us. Our process facilitates the early evaluation and quantification of potential exposures in individual cases. This process also enables us to track those cases that have been scheduled for trial and/or mediation. Based on professional judgment and experience in using these litigation management tools and available information about current developments in all our cases, our legal organization regularly assesses the adequacy of current accruals and determines if adjustment of existing accruals, or establishment of new accruals, is required.
We have contingent liabilities resulting from throughput agreements with pipeline and processing companies not associated with financing arrangements. Under these agreements, we may be required to provide any such company with additional funds through advances and penalties for fees related to throughput capacity not utilized. In addition, at March 31, 2025, we had performance obligations secured by letters of credit of $
284
million (issued as direct bank letters of credit) related to various purchase commitments for materials, supplies, commercial activities and services incident to the ordinary conduct of business.
In 2007, the government of Venezuela expropriated ConocoPhillips’ interests in the Petrozuata and Hamaca heavy oil ventures, as well as the offshore Corocoro development project. In response, ConocoPhillips initiated international arbitration proceedings before the ICSID. In
March 2019, an ICSID tribunal unanimously ordered the government of Venezuela to pay ConocoPhillips approximately $
8.7
billion (later reduced to $
8.5
billion) plus interest for the unlawful expropriation of the projects. On January 22, 2025, an ICSID annulment committee dismissed Venezuela’s application to annul the tribunal’s decision and upheld the $
8.5
billion award plus interest in full. Separate arbitrations before the ICC resulted in additional awards against Petróleos de Venezuela, S.A. (PDVSA) and
three
of its affiliates, including an award for approximately $
2
billion plus interest, for the Hamaca and Petrozuata projects, and a $
33
million award, for the Corocoro project, plus interest. Cumulatively, as of March 31, 2025, the company has received approximately $
789
million in connection with the first ICC award.
Collection actions for all
three
awards are ongoing.
ConocoPhillips has ensured that all actions related to these arbitration awards meet all appropriate U.S. regulatory requirements, including those related to any applicable sanctions imposed by the U.S. against Venezuela.
Beginning in 2017, governmental and other entities in several states/territories in the U.S. have filed lawsuits against oil and gas companies, including ConocoPhillips, seeking compensatory damages and equitable relief to abate alleged climate change impacts. Additional lawsuits with similar allegations are expected to be filed. The legal and factual issues are unprecedented; therefore, there is significant uncertainty about the scope of the claims and alleged damages and any potential impact on the Company’s financial condition. ConocoPhillips believes these lawsuits are factually and legally meritless and are an inappropriate vehicle to address the challenges associated with climate change and will vigorously defend against such lawsuits.
Several Louisiana parishes and the State of Louisiana have filed numerous lawsuits under Louisiana’s State and Local Coastal Resources Management Act (SLCRMA) against oil and gas companies, including ConocoPhillips, seeking compensatory damages for contamination and erosion of the Louisiana coastline allegedly caused by historical oil and gas operations. ConocoPhillips entities are defendants in several of the lawsuits and will vigorously defend against them. Because plaintiffs’ SLCRMA theories are unprecedented, there is uncertainty about these claims (both as to scope and damages), and we continue to evaluate our exposure in these lawsuits while assessing options for early resolution.
In October 2020, the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE) ordered the prior owners of Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) Lease P-0166, including ConocoPhillips, to decommission the lease facilities, including
two
offshore platforms located near Carpinteria, California. This order was sent after the current owner of OCS Lease P-0166 relinquished the lease and abandoned the lease platforms and facilities. BSEE’s order to ConocoPhillips is premised on its connection to Phillips Petroleum Company, a legacy company of ConocoPhillips, which held a historical
25
percent interest in this lease and operated these facilities but sold its interest approximately
30
years ago. ConocoPhillips continues to evaluate its exposure in this matter.
In July 2021, a federal securities class action was filed against Concho Resources Inc. (Concho), certain of Concho’s officers, and ConocoPhillips as Concho’s successor in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas. On October 21, 2021, the court issued an order appointing Utah Retirement Systems and the Construction Laborers Pension Trust for Southern California as lead plaintiffs (Lead Plaintiffs). On January 7, 2022, the Lead Plaintiffs filed their consolidated complaint alleging that Concho made materially false and misleading statements regarding its business and operations in violation of the federal securities laws and seeking unspecified damages, attorneys’ fees, costs, equitable/injunctive relief and such other relief that may be deemed appropriate. The defendants filed a motion to dismiss the consolidated complaint on March 8, 2022. On June 23, 2023, the court denied defendants’ motion as to most defendants including Concho/ConocoPhillips. On April 7, 2025, the court certified a class. We believe the allegations in the action are without merit and are vigorously defending this litigation.
ConocoPhillips is involved in pending disputes with commercial counterparties relating to the propriety of its force majeure notices following Winter Storm Uri in 2021. We believe these claims are without merit and are vigorously defending them.
Note 10—Derivative and Financial Instruments
We use futures, forwards, swaps and options in various markets to meet our customer needs, capture market opportunities and manage foreign exchange currency risk.
Commodity Derivative Instruments
Our commodity business primarily consists of natural gas, crude oil, bitumen, NGLs, LNG and power.
Commodity derivative instruments are held at fair value on our consolidated balance sheet. Where these balances have the right of setoff, they are presented on a net basis. Related cash flows are recorded as operating activities on our consolidated statement of cash flows. On our consolidated income statement, gains and losses are recognized either on a gross basis if directly related to our physical business or a net basis if held for trading. Gains and losses related to contracts that meet and are designated with the NPNS exception are recognized upon settlement. We generally apply this exception to eligible crude contracts and certain gas contracts. We do not apply hedge accounting for our commodity derivatives.
The following table presents the gross fair values of our commodity derivatives, excluding collateral, on our consolidated balance sheet:
The gains (losses) from commodity derivatives included in our consolidated income statement are presented in the following table:
The table below summarizes our net exposures resulting from outstanding commodity derivative contracts:
Interest Rate Derivative Instruments
I
n 2023, PALNG executed interest rate swaps that had the effect of converting
60
percent of the projected term loans outstanding to finance the cost of development and construction of Phase 1 from floating to fixed rate. During the first quarter of 2025, PALNG dedesignated the remaining portion of the interest rate swaps previously designated as a cash flow hedge.
Changes in the fair value of the dedesignated hedging instruments are reported in the “Equity in earnings of affiliates” line on our consolidated income statement.
For the three-month period ended March 31, 2025, we recognized a gain of $
15
million in “Equity in earnings of affiliates” related to the swaps. For the three-month period ended March 31, 2024, we recognized an unrealized loss of $
20
million in other comprehensive income (loss) related to these swaps.

The following table summarizes the amortized cost basis and fair value of investments in debt securities classified as available for sale:
As of March 31, 2025, and March 31, 2024, total unrealized gains for debt securities classified as available for sale with net gains and total unrealized losses for debt securities classified as available for sale with net
losses were
negligible.
No
allowance for credit losses has been recorded on investments in debt securities which are in an unrealized loss position.
For the three-month periods ended March 31, 2025, and March 31, 2024, proceeds from sales and redemptions of investments in debt securities classified as available for sale were
$
211
million and $
222
million, respectively. Gross realized gains and losses included in earnings from those sales and redemptions were negligible. The cost of securities sold and redeemed is determined using the specific identification method.
Credit Risk
Financial instruments potentially exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents, short-term investments, long-term investments in debt securities, OTC derivative contracts and trade receivables. Our cash equivalents and short-term investments are placed in high-quality commercial paper, government money market funds, U.S. government and government agency obligations, time deposits with major international banks and financial institutions, high-quality corporate bonds, foreign government obligations and asset-backed securities. Our long-term investments in debt securities are placed in high-quality corporate bonds, asset-backed securities, U.S. government and government agency obligations, and foreign government obligations.
The credit risk from our OTC derivative contracts, such as forwards, swaps and options, derives from the counterparty to the transaction. Individual counterparty exposure is managed within predetermined credit limits and includes the use of cash-call margins when appropriate, thereby reducing the risk of significant nonperformance. We also use futures, swaps and option contracts that have a negligible credit risk because these trades are cleared primarily with an exchange clearinghouse and subject to mandatory margin requirements until settled; however, we are exposed to the credit risk of those exchange brokers for receivables arising from daily margin cash calls, as well as for cash deposited to meet initial margin requirements.
Our trade receivables result primarily from our petroleum operations and reflect a broad national and international customer base, which limits our exposure to concentrations of credit risk. The majority of these receivables have payment terms of
30
days or less, and we continually monitor this exposure and the creditworthiness of the counterparties. We may require collateral to limit the exposure to loss including letters of credit, prepayments and surety bonds, as well as master netting arrangements to mitigate credit risk with counterparties that both buy from and sell to us, as these agreements permit the amounts owed by us or owed to others to be offset against amounts due to us.
Certain of our derivative instruments contain provisions that require us to post collateral if the derivative exposure exceeds a threshold amount. We have contracts with fixed threshold amounts and other contracts with variable threshold amounts that are contingent on our credit rating. The variable threshold amounts typically decline for lower credit ratings, while both the variable and fixed threshold amounts typically revert to zero if we fall below investment grade. Cash is the primary collateral in all contracts; however, many also permit us to post letters of credit as collateral, such as transactions administered through the New York Mercantile Exchange.
The aggregate fair value of all derivative instruments with such credit risk-related contingent features that were in a liability position at March 31, 2025, and December 31, 2024, was $
121
million and $
70
million, respectively. For these instruments, collateral posted at March 31, 2025 was $
4
million and
no
collateral was posted at December 31, 2024. If our credit rating had been downgraded below investment grade at March 31, 2025, we would have been required to post $
57
million of additional collateral, either with cash or letters of credit.
Note 11—Fair Value Measurement
We carry a portion of our assets and liabilities at fair value that are measured at the reporting date using an exit price (i.e., the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability) and disclosed according to the quality of valuation inputs under the fair value hierarchy.
The classification of an asset or liability is based on the lowest level of input significant to its fair value. Those that are initially classified as Level 3 are subsequently reported as Level 2 when the fair value derived from unobservable inputs is inconsequential to the overall fair value, or if corroborated market data becomes available. Assets and liabilities initially reported as Level 2 are subsequently reported as Level 3 if corroborated market data is no longer available. There were no material transfers into or out of Level 3 during the three-month period ended March 31, 2025, nor during the year ended December 31, 2024.
Recurring Fair Value Measurement
Financial assets and liabilities reported at fair value on a recurring basis include our investments in debt securities classified as available for sale, commodity derivatives and our contingent consideration arrangement related to the Surmont acquisition.
See Note
3.
•
Level 1 derivative assets and liabilities primarily represent exchange-traded futures and options that are valued using unadjusted prices available from the underlying exchange. Level 1 financial assets also include our investments in U.S. government obligations classified as available for sale debt securities, which are valued using exchange prices.
•
Level 2 derivative assets and liabilities primarily represent OTC swaps, options and forward purchase and sale contracts that are valued using adjusted exchange prices, prices provided by brokers or pricing service companies that are all corroborated by market data. Level 2 financial assets also include our investments in debt securities classified as available for sale including investments in corporate bonds, commercial paper, asset-backed securities, U.S. government agency obligations and foreign government obligations that are valued using pricing provided by brokers or pricing service companies that are corroborated with market data.
•
Level 3 derivative assets and liabilities consist of OTC swaps, options and forward purchase and sale contracts where a significant portion of fair value is calculated from underlying market data that is not readily available. The derived value uses industry standard methodologies that may consider the historical relationships among various commodities, modeled market prices, time value, volatility factors and other relevant economic measures. The use of these inputs results in management’s best estimate of fair value. Level 3 commodity derivative activity was not material for all periods presented.
•
Level 3 liabilities include the fair value of future quarterly contingent payments to TotalEnergies EP Canada Ltd. in connection with the acquisition of the remaining
50
percent working interest in Surmont. Contingent consideration consists of payments up to approximately $
0.4
billion CAD over a
five-year
term ending in the fourth quarter of 2028. The contingent payments represent $
2
million for every dollar that the monthly WCS average pricing exceeds $
52
per barrel. The terms include adjustments related to not achieving certain production targets. During the three-month period ended March 31, 2025, we made payments of approximately $
39
million USD to TotalEnergies EP Canada Ltd. under this arrangement. These payments are included in the "Other" line within the Financing Activities section of our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. The fair value of the remaining contingent consideration as of March 31, 2025, is calculated using the income approach and is largely based on the estimated commodity price outlook using a combination of external pricing service companies' and our internal price outlook (unobservable input) and a discount rate consistent with those used by principal market participants (observable input). The impact of other unobservable inputs on the fair value as of March 31, 2025, was not significant.
The following table summarizes the fair value hierarchy for gross financial assets and liabilities (i.e., unadjusted where the right of setoff exists for commodity derivatives accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis):
The range and arithmetic average of the significant unobservable input used in the Level 3 fair value measurement was as follows:
*Commodity price outlook based on a combination of external pricing service companies' outlooks and our internal outlook.
The following table summarizes those commodity derivative balances subject to the right of setoff as presented on our consolidated balance sheet. We have elected to offset the recognized fair value amounts for multiple derivative instruments executed with the same counterparty in our financial statements when a legal right of setoff exists.
At March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, we did not present any amounts gross on our consolidated balance sheet where we had the right of setoff.
Reported Fair Values of Financial Instruments
We used the following methods and assumptions to estimate the fair value of financial instruments:
•
Cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments: The carrying amount reported on the balance sheet approximates fair value. For those investments classified as available for sale debt securities, the carrying amount reported on the balance sheet is fair value.
•
Accounts and notes receivable (including long-term and related parties): The carrying amount reported on the balance sheet approximates fair value.
•
Investments in debt securities classified as available for sale: The fair value of investments in debt securities categorized as Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy is measured using exchange prices. The fair value of investments in debt securities categorized as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy is measured using pricing provided by brokers or pricing service companies that are corroborated with market data.
See
Note
10
.
•
Accounts payable (including related parties) and floating-rate debt: The carrying amount of accounts payable and floating-rate debt reported on the balance sheet approximates fair value.
•
Fixed-rate debt: The estimated fair value of fixed-rate debt is measured using prices available from a pricing service that is corroborated by market data; therefore, these liabilities are categorized as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.
•
Commercial paper: The carrying amount of our commercial paper instruments approximates fair value and is reported on the balance sheet as short-term debt.
The following table summarizes the net fair value of financial instruments (i.e., adjusted where the right of setoff exists for commodity derivatives):

Note 16—Sales and Other Operating Revenues
Revenue from Contracts with Customers
The following table provides further disaggregation of our consolidated sales and other operating revenues:
Revenues from contracts outside the scope of ASC Topic 606 relate primarily to physical gas contracts at market prices, which qualify as derivatives accounted for under ASC Topic 815, “Derivatives and Hedging,” and for which we have not elected NPNS. There is no significant difference in contractual terms or the policy for recognition of revenue from these contracts and those within the scope of ASC Topic 606.
The following disaggregation of revenues is provided in conjunction with
Note
18
—Segment Disclosures and Related Information:
Practical Expedients
Typically, our commodity sales contracts are less than 12 months in duration; however, in certain specific cases may extend longer, which may be out to the end of field life. We have long-term commodity sales contracts which use prevailing market prices at the time of delivery, and under these contracts, the market-based variable consideration for each performance obligation (i.e., delivery of commodity) is allocated to each wholly unsatisfied performance obligation within the contract. Accordingly, we have applied the practical expedient allowed in ASC Topic 606 and do not disclose the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to performance obligations or when we expect to recognize revenues that are unsatisfied as of the end of the reporting period.
Receivables from Contracts with Customers
At March 31, 2025, the “Accounts and notes receivable” line on our consolidated balance sheet included trade receivables of $
5,188
million compared with $
5,398
million at December 31, 2024, and included both contracts with customers within the scope of ASC Topic 606 and those that are outside the scope of ASC Topic 606. We typically receive payment within 30 days or less (depending on the terms of the invoice) once delivery is made. Revenues that are outside the scope of ASC Topic 606 relate primarily to physical natural gas sales contracts at market prices for which we do not elect NPNS and are therefore accounted for as a derivative under ASC Topic 815. There is little distinction in the nature of the customer or credit quality of trade receivables associated with natural gas sold under contracts for which NPNS has not been elected compared with trade receivables where NPNS has been elected.
Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers
We have entered into certain agreements under which we license our proprietary technology, including the Optimized Cascade® process technology, to customers to maximize the efficiency of LNG plants. These agreements typically provide for milestone payments to be made during and after the construction phases of the LNG plant. The payments are not directly related to our performance obligations under the contract and are recorded as deferred revenue to be recognized when the customer is able to benefit from their right to use the applicable licensed technology.
Revenue recognized during the three-month period ended March 31, 2025, and March 31, 2024, was
immaterial
. We expect to recognize the outstanding contract liabilities of $
45
million as of March 31, 2025, as revenue during the years 2026, 2028 and 2029.

Note 18—Segment Disclosures and Related Information
We explore for, produce, transport and market crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, LNG and NGLs on a worldwide basis. We manage our operations through
six
operating segments, which are primarily defined by geographic region: Alaska; Lower 48 (L48); Canada; Europe, Middle East and North Africa (EMENA); Asia Pacific (AP); and Other International (OI).
Corporate and Other (Corporate) represents income and costs not directly associated with an operating segment, such as most interest expense; premiums on early retirement of debt; corporate overhead and certain technology activities, including licensing revenues. Corporate assets include all cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments.
Our chief operating decision maker (CODM) is our Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer, who evaluates performance and allocates resources among our operating segments based on each segment's net income (loss). This is done through the annual budget and forecasting process.

Note 19—Income Taxes
Our effective tax rate for the three-month periods ended March 31, 2025, and March 31, 2024, was
36.2
percent and
33.0
percent, respectively. The change in the effective tax rate for the three-month period ended March 31, 2025, is primarily due to a shift in our mix of income among taxing jurisdictions and the recognition of a Malaysia tax benefit occurring in the three-month period ending March 31, 2024, described below, partly offset by a change to our valuation allowance.
For the three-month period ended March 31, 2025, our valuation allowance decreased $
56
million, relating to the expected utilization of previously unrecognized capital loss carryforwards due to our agreement to sell our interests in the Ursa and Europa Fields, and the Ursa Oil Pipeline Company LLC to Shell Offshore Inc. and Shell Pipeline Company LP.
During the first quarter of 2024, we recorded a $
76
million tax benefit associated with a deepwater investment tax incentive for Malaysia Blocks J and G.
The Company has ongoing income tax audits in a number of jurisdictions. The government agents in charge of these audits regularly request additional time to complete audits, which we generally grant, and conversely occasionally close audits unpredictably. Within the next twelve months, we may have audit periods close that could significantly impact our total unrecognized tax benefits. The amount of such change is not estimable but could be significant when compared with our total unrecognized tax benefits.

Business Environment and Executive Overview
ConocoPhillips is one of the world’s leading E&P companies based on production and reserves, with operations and activities in 15 countries. Our diverse, low cost of supply portfolio includes resource-rich unconventional plays in North America; conventional assets in North America, Europe, Africa and Asia; global LNG developments; oil sands in Canada; and an inventory of global exploration prospects. Headquartered in Houston, Texas, at March 31, 2025, we employed approximately 11,800 people worldwide and had total assets of $124 billion.
Overview
At ConocoPhillips, we anticipate that commodity prices will continue to be cyclical and volatile, and our view is that a successful business strategy in the E&P industry must be resilient in lower price environments while also retaining upside during periods of higher prices. As such, we are unhedged, remain committed to our disciplined investment framework and continually monitor market fundamentals, including the impacts associated with geopolitical tensions and conflicts, global demand for our products, oil and gas inventory levels, governmental policies, tariffs, inflation and supply chain disruptions.
In the second quarter of 2025, we began to see the price of crude oil decline due to several macroeconomic market impacts. This includes the U.S. announcing the imposition of broad-ranging tariffs on several U.S. trade partners and the related reactions to such tariffs, including retaliatory tariffs. There is significant uncertainty as to the scope and duration of these or any future tariffs. Other macroeconomic market impacts include actions taken by OPEC Plus and other major oil producing countries. We are continuing to closely monitor the macroeconomic environment, and despite ongoing market volatility in the energy landscape and across global markets, we believe our business strategy will continue providing value in volatile environments; however, the ultimate impact on the company's results of operations and financial condition remains uncertain.
The global energy industry continues to evolve. We believe ConocoPhillips plays an essential role in responsibly meeting the global demand for energy, while continuing to deliver competitive returns on and of capital and working to meet our previously established emissions-reduction targets. We call this our Triple Mandate, and it represents our commitment to create long-term value for stockholders. Our value proposition to deliver competitive returns to stockholders through price cycles is guided by our foundational principles which consist of maintaining balance sheet strength, providing peer-leading distributions, making disciplined investments, and demonstrating responsible and reliable ESG performance.
In November 2024, we completed our acquisition of Marathon Oil Corporation (Marathon Oil). In the first quarter of 2025, we continued to integrate the acquired assets into our portfolio. We expect to capture greater than $1 billion in synergies on a run rate basis within the first full year following the close of the transaction.
See Note 3.
In conjunction with our acquisition of Marathon Oil, we communicated a disposition proceeds target of $2 billion across the portfolio. Through May 2025, we have closed definitive agreements to dispose of certain assets in the Lower 48 segment for proceeds of approximately $1.3 billion. This is inclusive of noncore assets in our Lower 48 segment disposed of in the first quarter of 2025 as well as the disposition of the Ursa and Europa Fields, and Ursa Oil Pipeline Company LLC in the second quarter of 2025.
See Note 3.
In May 2025, we declared a second-quarter ordinary dividend of $0.78 per share.
Operationally, we remain focused on safely executing the business while also progressing key strategic initiatives. At Willow, we made significant progress during the winter construction season and achieved critical milestones. In the Lower 48, we continued to execute our program as well as integrate Marathon Oil assets into our portfolio, focusing on operating and capital efficiencies. Internationally, we became the sole operator of the Kebabangan Cluster (KBBC) PSC in Malaysia in January 2025, extending the PSC to 2050 and making KBBC our first operated producing asset in Malaysia. We also achieved first oil at partner-operated Gumusut Phase 4 in February 2025.
Production was 2,389 MBOED in the first quarter of 2025, an increase of 487 MBOED from the same period a year ago. After adjusting for impacts from closed acquisitions and dispositions, first-quarter
2025 production increased by 115 MBOED or five percent from the same period a year ago.
First-quarter 2025 production resulted in $6.1 billion of cash provided by operating activities. We returned $2.5 billion to shareholders, consisting of $1.5 billion through share repurchases and $1 billion through our ordinary dividend. We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term investments totaling $7.5 billion and long-term investments in debt securities of $1.0 billion.
Also in the first quarter of 2025, we re-invested $3.4 billion into the business in the form of capital expenditures and investments, with over half of the expenditures related to flexible, short-cycle unconventional plays in the Lower 48 segment, where our production has access to both domestic and export markets.
Business Environment
Commodity prices are the most significant factor impacting our profitability and related returns on and of capital to our shareholders. Dynamics that could influence world energy markets and commodity prices include, but are not limited to, global economic health, supply or demand disruptions or fears thereof caused by civil unrest, global pandemics, military conflicts, actions taken by OPEC Plus and other major oil producing countries, environmental laws, tariffs, governmental policies and weather-related disruptions. Our strategy is to create value through price cycles by delivering on the financial, operational and ESG priorities that underpin our value proposition.
Our earnings and operating cash flows generally correlate with price levels for crude oil and natural gas, which are subject to factors external to the company and over which we have no control. The following graph depicts the trend in average benchmark prices for WTI crude oil, Brent crude oil and U.S. Henry Hub natural gas:
Brent crude oil prices averaged $75.66 per barrel in the first quarter of 2025, a decrease of nine percent compared with $83.24 per barrel in the first quarter of 2024. WTI at Cushing crude oil prices averaged $71.42 per barrel in the first quarter of 2025, a decrease of seven percent compared with $76.96 per barrel in the first quarter of 2024. Oil prices were lower in the first quarter of 2025 due to higher than expected global oil supplies and elevated geopolitical uncertainties impacting markets.
U.S. Henry Hub natural gas prices averaged $3.65 per MMBTU in the first quarter of 2025, an increase of 62 percent compared with $2.25 per MMBTU in the first quarter of 2024. U.S. Henry Hub prices improved due to cold winter weather and stronger demand. Lower 48 segment realized gas prices improved in the first quarter of 2025 primarily due to fewer third-party pipeline constraints. Volatility in regional markers is expected throughout 2025.
Our realized bitumen price averaged $45.29 per barrel in the first quarter of 2025, an increase of two percent compared with $44.30 per barrel in the first quarter of 2024. The increase in the first quarter of 2025 was driven by narrowing WCS differentials due to increased egress at the Trans Mountain Pipeline Expansion. We continue to optimize bitumen price realizations through enhanced diluent recovery unit operations, blending and transportation strategies.
For the first quarter of 2025, our total average realized price was $53.34 per BOE compared with $56.60 per BOE in the first quarter of 2024.

Segment Results
Unless otherwise indicated, discussion of segment results for the three-month period ended March 31, 2025, is based on a comparison with the corresponding period of 2024 and are shown after-tax.
A summary of the company's net income (loss) by business segment follows:
For further discussion of segment results, see the following pages.
Alaska
The Alaska segment primarily explores for, produces, transports and markets crude oil, NGLs and natural gas. As of March 31, 2025, Alaska contributed 12 percent of our consolidated liquids production and two percent of our consolidated natural gas production.
Net Income (Loss)
Alaska reported earnings of $327 million in the first quarter of 2025 compared with earnings of $346 million in the first quarter of 2024.
Earnings in the first quarter of 2025 included lower revenues resulting from lower realized prices of $89 million, partly offset by higher volumes of $22 million. Decreases to earnings included higher DD&A expenses of $22 million. Increases to earnings included lower taxes other than income taxes of $52 million driven by an impact from the settlement of a contingent matter and lower exploration expenses primarily due to absence of seismic work of $26 million from the first quarter of 2024.
Production
Average production increased seven MBOED in the three-month period of 2025. Increases to production were primarily due to new wells online, less downtime and production from our fourth quarter of 2024 acquisition of additional working interest in the Kuparuk River Unit and Prudhoe Bay Unit.
The production increases were partly offset by normal field decline.
Lower 48
The Lower 48 segment consists of operations located in the U.S. Lower 48 states and commercial operations. As of March 31, 2025, the Lower 48 contributed 66 percent of our consolidated liquids production and 73 percent of our consolidated natural gas production.
Net Income (Loss)
Lower 48 reported earnings of $1,790 million in the first quarter of 2025 compared with earnings of $1,381 million in the first quarter of 2024.
Earnings in the first quarter of 2025 included higher revenues resulting from higher volumes of $1,305 million, which included volumes from our acquisition of Marathon Oil. Additional increases to revenues included timing of sales, partly offset by lower overall realized prices of $109 million, driven by lower crude prices. Decreases to earnings in the first quarter of 2025 included higher DD&A expenses of $378 million and higher production and operating expenses of $326 million, primarily from our acquisition of Marathon Oil.
See Note

.
Production
Average production increased 416 MBOED in the three-month period of 2025. Increases to production were primarily due to new wells online from our development programs in the Delaware Basin, Eagle Ford, Midland Basin and Bakken. Production also increased due to our acquisition of Marathon Oil in November 2024.

.
Production increases were partly offset by normal field decline.
Asset Dispositions and Held For Sale
Through May 2025, we have completed divestitures of noncore assets totaling approximately $1.3 billion in proceeds. Production from these assets averaged approximately 26 MBOED in 2024. This is inclusive of noncore assets disposed of in the first quarter of 2025 as well as the disposition of the Ursa and Europa Fields, and Ursa Oil Pipeline Company LLC in the second quarter of 2025.

Canada
*Average sales prices include unutilized transportation costs.
The Canada segment operations include the Surmont oil sands development in Alberta, the Montney unconventional play in British Columbia and commercial operations. As of March 31, 2025, Canada contributed 10 percent of our consolidated liquids production and four percent of our consolidated natural gas production.
Net Income (Loss)
Canada reported earnings of $256 million in the first quarter of 2025 compared with earnings of $180 million in the first quarter of 2024.
Earnings in the first quarter of 2025 included higher revenues driven primarily by higher volumes of $33 million. Additional increases to earnings resulted from lower DD&A expenses of $20 million driven by year-end upward reserve revisions and lower production and operating expenses of $12 million, driven by lower workover activity.
Production
Average production increased 14 MBOED in the three-month period of 2025. Increases to production resulted from new wells online in the Montney and Surmont.
Production increases were partly offset by normal field decline.
Europe, Middle East and North Africa
Production and sales prices exclude equity affiliates. See
Summary Operating Statistics
for equity affiliate totals.
The Europe, Middle East and North Africa segment consists of operations principally located in the Norwegian sector of the North Sea and the Norwegian Sea, Qatar, Libya, Equatorial Guinea and commercial and terminalling operations in the U.K. As of March 31, 2025, our Europe, Middle East and North Africa operations contributed eight percent of our consolidated liquids production and 19 percent of our consolidated natural gas production.
Net Income (Loss)
Europe, Middle East and North Africa reported earnings of $419 million in the first quarter of 2025 compared with earnings of $304 million in the first quarter of 2024.
Earnings in the first quarter of 2025 included higher revenues resulting from higher volumes of $90 million, which included volumes added from our acquisition of Marathon Oil and higher realized prices of $21 million impacted by higher gas prices.
See Note

Production increases were partly offset by normal field decline.
Asia Pacific
Production and sales prices exclude equity affiliates. See
Summary Operating Statistics
for equity affiliate totals.
The Asia Pacific segment has operations in China, Malaysia, Australia and commercial operations in China, Singapore and Japan. As of March 31, 2025, Asia Pacific contributed four percent of our consolidated liquids production and two percent of our consolidated natural gas production.
Net Income (Loss)
Asia Pacific reported earnings of $311 million in the first quarter of 2025 compared with earnings of $512 million in the first quarter of 2024.
Earnings in the first quarter of 2025 included lower revenues resulting from lower realized prices of $40 million, partly offset by higher volumes of $24 million. Decreases to earnings included the absence of a $76 million tax benefit associated with a deepwater investment tax incentive for Malaysia blocks J and G; lower earnings from equity affiliates of $76 million, primarily due to lower LNG sales prices; and higher exploration expenses of $37 million driven primarily by dry hole expenses associated with certain suspended wells.

Consolidated Production
Average consolidated production increased six MBOED in the three-month period of 2025. Increases to production were primarily due to development activity in Bohai Bay in China and Gumusut in Malaysia; an increase in crude oil entitlement percentage and higher gas demand in Malaysia.
Production increases were partly offset by normal field decline.
Gumusut Phase 4 First Production in Malaysia
In February 2025, Phase 4 of the partner-operated Gumusut field which straddles the Malaysia-Brunei border, reached first production.
Other International
The Other International segment consists of activities associated with prior operations in other countries.
Corporate and Other
Net interest expense consists of interest and debt expense, net of interest income and capitalized interest. Net interest expense was impaired due to higher interest expense of $60 million driven by our acquisition of Marathon Oil, partly offset by an impact to interest expense of $36 million from the settlement of a contingent matter.
Corporate G&A expenses include compensation programs and staff costs. Corporate G&A expenses increased $5 million in the first quarter of 2025, primarily due to transaction and integration expenses associated with our acquisition of Marathon Oil, partially offset by mark to market adjustments associated with certain compensation programs.
Technology includes our investments in low-carbon and other new technologies or businesses and licensing revenues. Other new technologies or businesses and licensing activities are focused on both conventional and tight oil reservoirs, shale gas, oil sands, enhanced oil recovery, as well as LNG.
Other income (expense) or “Other” includes certain consolidating tax-related items, foreign currency transaction gains and losses, environmental costs associated with sites no longer in operation, other costs not directly associated with an operating segment, gains/losses on the early retirement of debt, holding gains or losses on equity securities and pension settlement expense. “Other” was impaired in the first quarter of 2025 primarily due to lower tax benefits related to stock compensation of $38 million and a first quarter 2025 consolidating tax adjustment of $28 million.
Capital Resources and Liquidity
Financial Indicators
*
Capital includes total debt and total equity.
To meet our short-term and long-term liquidity requirements, we look to a variety of funding sources, including cash generated from operating activities, our commercial paper and credit facility programs and our ability to sell securities using our shelf registration statement. During the first three months of 2025, the primary uses of our available cash were $3.4 billion to support our ongoing capital expenditures and investments program, $1.5 billion to repurchase common stock, $1.0 billion to pay the ordinary dividend, $0.5 billion to retire debt at maturity and $0.4 billion net purchases of investments, partly offset by non-core asset sales of $0.6 billion and invoice payment timing of $1.3 billion.
At March 31, 2025, we had total liquidity of $12.7 billion, comprised of cash and cash equivalents of $6.3 billion, short-term investments of $0.9 billion and available borrowing capacity under our credit facility of $5.5 billion. In addition, we have $1.0 billion of long-term investments in debt securities. We believe current cash balances and cash generated by operating activities, together with access to external sources of funds as described below in the “Significant Changes in Capital” section, will be sufficient to meet our funding requirements in the near- and long-term, including our capital spending program, acquisitions, dividend payments and debt obligations.
Significant Changes in Capital
Operating Activities
Cash provided by operating activities was $6.1 billion for the first three months of 2025, compared with $5.0 billion for the corresponding period of 2024. The increase in cash is primarily due to changes in operational working capital, driven by invoice and tax payment timing, and higher sales volumes from our acquisition of the Marathon Oil assets in the fourth quarter of 2024.
See Note
3
.
Our short-term and long-term operating cash flows are highly dependent upon prices for crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, LNG and NGLs. Prices and margins in our industry have historically been volatile and are driven by market conditions over which we have no control. Absent other mitigating factors, as these prices and margins fluctuate, we would expect a corresponding change in our operating cash flows.
The level of absolute production volumes, as well as product and location mix, is another significant factor impacting our cash flows. Future production is subject to numerous uncertainties, including, among others, the volatile crude oil and natural gas price environment, which may impact investment decisions; the effects of price changes on production sharing and variable-royalty contracts; acquisition and disposition of fields; field production decline rates; new technologies; operating efficiencies; timing of startups and major turnarounds; political instability; government regulations; impacts of a global pandemic; weather-related disruptions; and the addition of proved reserves through exploratory success and their timely and cost-effective development. While we actively monitor and manage these factors, changes in production levels can cause variability in cash flows, although we generally experience less variability in our cash flows due to changes in production levels than due to changes in commodity prices.
To maintain or grow our production volumes, we must continue to add to our proved reserve base. See the
“
Cap
ital Expenditures and Investments”
section.
Investing Activities
For the first three months of 2025, we invested $3.4 billion in capital expenditures and investments. Our 2025 operating plan capital expenditures are currently expected to be $12.3 billion to $12.6 billion. Our 2024 capital expenditures and investments were $12.1 billion. See the
“Capital Expenditures and Investments”
section.
In the first three months of 2025, net cash used in investing activities was impacted by an increase in working capital changes associated with investing activities of $827 million, due to timing of invoice payments.
In the first quarter of 2025, we recognized proceeds from asset dispositions of $0.6 billion. Subsequent to the quarter, we closed our disposition of Ursa and Europa Fields, and Ursa Oil Pipeline Company for $0.7 billion. Through May 2025, total proceeds from these dispositions in our Lower 48 segment are approximately $1.3 billion.
See Note
3
.
We invest in short-term and long-term investments as part of our cash investment strategy, the primary objective of which is to protect principal, maintain liquidity and provide yield and total returns. These investments include time deposits, commercial paper, as well as debt securities classified as available for sale. Short-term funds needed to support our operating plan and provide resiliency to react to short-term price volatility are invested in highly liquid instruments with maturities less than one year. Funds we consider available to maintain resiliency in longer term price downturns and to capture opportunities outside a given operating plan may be invested in instruments with maturities greater than one year.
See Note 10.
Investing activities in the first three months of 2025 included net purchases of $400 million of investments. We had net purchases of $261 million of short-term investments and net purchases of $139 million of long-term investments
.
See Note
13.
Financing Activities
In February 2025, we refinanced our revolving credit facility maintaining a total aggregate principal amount of $5.5 billion and extended the expiration to February 2030. The credit facility may be used for direct bank borrowings, the issuance of letters of credit totaling up to $500 million or as support for our commercial paper program. With no commercial paper outstanding and no direct borrowings or letters of credit, we had access to $5.5 billion in available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility at March 31, 2025.
Our debt balance at March 31, 2025, was $23.8 billion compared with $24.3 billion at December 31, 2024. The current portion of debt, including future payments for finance leases, is $0.6 billion at March 31, 2025. In the first quarter of 2025, the company retired $0.5 billion principal amount of debt at maturity, consisting of $0.4 billion of our 2.4% Notes and $0.1 billion of our 8.2% Debentures. Debt payments are expected to be made using current cash balances and cash provided by operating activities.
In February 2025, Moody's affirmed our long-term credit rating. The current long-term debt credit ratings are:
•
Fitch: “A” with a “stable” outlook
•
S&P: “A-” with a “stable” outlook
•
Moody's:
"
A2
"
with a

"
outlook
See Note

for additional information on debt and the revolving credit facility.
Certain of our project-related contracts, commercial contracts and derivative instruments contain provisions requiring us to post collateral. Many of these contracts and instruments permit us to post either cash or letters of credit as collateral. At March 31, 2025, and December 31, 2024, we had direct bank letters of credit of $284 million and $278 million, respectively, which secured performance obligations related to various purchase commitments incident to the ordinary conduct of business. In the event of a credit rating downgrade, we may be required to post additional letters of credit.
Shelf Registration
We have a universal shelf registration statement on file with the SEC under which we have the ability to issue and sell an indeterminate number of various types of debt and equity securities.
Capital Requirements
For information about our capital expenditures and investments, see the
“
Capital Expenditures and Investments
”
section.
We believe in delivering value to our shareholders through our return of capital framework. The framework is structured to deliver a compelling, growing ordinary dividend and through-cycle share repurchases. We anticipate returning greater than 30 percent of cash from operating activities through cycles.
In the first three months of 2025, we paid ordinary dividends of $0.78 per share and in the first three months of 2024, we paid ordinary dividends of $0.58 per share and VROC payments of $0.20 per share.
In May 2025, we declared an ordinary dividend of $0.78 per share, payable June 2, 2025, to shareholders of record at the close of business on May 19, 2025.
In late 2016, we initiated our current share repurchase program. In October 2024, our Board of Directors approved an increase from our prior authorization of $45 billion by a total of the lesser of $20 billion or the number of shares issued in our acquisition of Marathon Oil, such that the Company is not to exceed $65 billion in aggregate purchases. Share repurchases are made at management’s discretion, at prevailing prices, subject to market conditions and other factors. As of March 31, 2025, share repurchases since the inception of our current program totaled 447.7 million shares and $35.8 billion. In the three months ended March 31, 2025, we repurchased 15.1 million shares for a cost of $1.5 billion.

Summarized Balance Sheet Data
Contingencies
We are subject to legal proceedings, claims and liabilities that arise in the ordinary course of business. We accrue for losses associated with legal claims when such losses are considered probable and the amounts can be reasonably estimated.
See Note
9
.
For more discussion of the below topics, please see the Contingencies section in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of our 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Legal and Tax Matters
We are subject to various lawsuits and claims, including, but not limited to, matters involving oil and gas royalty and severance tax payments, gas measurement and valuation methods, contract disputes, environmental damages, climate change, personal injury and property damage. Our primary exposures for such matters relate to alleged royalty and tax underpayments on certain federal, state and privately owned properties, claims of alleged environmental contamination and damages from historic operations and climate change. We will continue to defend ourselves vigorously in these matters.
Our legal organization applies its knowledge, experience and professional judgment to the specific characteristics of our cases, employing a litigation management process to manage and monitor the legal proceedings against us. Our process facilitates the early evaluation and quantification of potential exposures in individual cases. This process also enables us to track those cases that have been scheduled for trial and/or mediation. Based on professional judgment and experience in using these litigation management tools and available information about current developments in all our cases, our legal organization regularly assesses the adequacy of current accruals and determines if adjustment of existing accruals, or establishment of new accruals, is required.
Environmental
We are subject to the same numerous international, federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations as other companies in our industry. We occasionally receive requests for information or notices of potential liability from the U.S. EPA and state environmental agencies alleging that we are a potentially responsible party under the CERCLA or an equivalent state statute. On occasion, we also have been made a party to cost recovery litigation by those agencies or by private parties. These requests, notices and lawsuits assert potential liability for remediation costs at various sites that typically are not owned by us, but allegedly contain waste attributable to our past operations. As of March 31, 2025, there were 16 sites around the U.S. in which we were identified as a potentially responsible party under CERCLA and comparable state laws. For remediation activities in the U.S. and Canada, our consolidated balance sheet included total accrued environmental costs of $210 million at March 31, 2025, compared with $206 million at December 31, 2024. We expect to incur a substantial amount of these expenditures within the next 30 years.
Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, and as with other companies engaged in similar businesses, environmental costs and liabilities are inherent concerns in our operations and products, and there can be no assurance that material costs and liabilities will not be incurred. However, we currently do not expect any material adverse effect upon our results of operations or financial position as a result of compliance with current environmental laws and regulations.
Climate Change
Continuing political and social attention to the issue of global climate change has resulted in a broad range of proposed or promulgated state, national and international laws focusing on GHG emissions reduction. These laws apply or could apply in countries where we have interests or may have interests in the future. Laws in this field continue to evolve and while it is not possible to accurately estimate either a timetable for implementation or our future compliance costs relating to implementation, such laws, if enacted, could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition.
Company Response to Climate-Related Risks
The objective of our Climate Risk Strategy is to manage climate-related risk, optimize opportunities and equip the company to respond to changes in key uncertainties, including government policies around the world, technologies for emissions reduction, alternative energy technologies and changes in consumer trends. The strategy sets out our choices around portfolio composition, emissions reductions, targets and incentives, emissions-related technology development, and our climate-related policy and finance sector engagement.
Our Climate Risk Strategy is intended to enable us to responsibly meet the global demand for energy, deliver competitive returns on and of capital and work to meet our previously established emissions-reduction targets. First, meeting global energy demand requires a focus on delivering production that will best compete in any energy mix scenario. This production will be delivered from resources with a competitive cost of supply and low GHG intensity, as well as portfolio diversity by market and asset type. Next, in delivering competitive returns, ConocoPhillips has been a leader in shifting the exploration and production sector’s value proposition away from one focused on production toward one focused on returns. Finally, to drive accountability for the emissions that are within our control, we are progressing toward our Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions intensity targets.

Item 3.     Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
Information about market risks for the three months ended March 31, 2025, does not differ materially from that discussed under Item 7A in our 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Item 4.    Controls and Procedures
We maintain disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure information required to be disclosed in reports we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Act), is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. At March 31, 2025, with the participation of our management, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (principal executive officer) and our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer (principal financial officer) carried out an evaluation, pursuant to Rule 13a-15(b) of the Act, of ConocoPhillips’ disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Act). Based upon that evaluation, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer concluded our disclosure controls and procedures were operating effectively at March 31, 2025.
In the first quarter of 2025, we completed the final phase of a multi-year implementation of an updated global enterprise resource planning system (ERP). As a result, we made corresponding changes to our business processes and information systems, updating applicable internal controls over financial reporting where necessary.
Our assessment of, and conclusion on, the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, did not include the internal controls of Marathon Oil Corporation, acquired in 2024. In the fourth quarter of 2024, we began integrating Marathon Oil into our operations and internal control processes. As the integration progresses, we may modify or change certain processes and procedures which may result in changes to our internal controls over financial reporting.
There have been no other changes in our internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Act, in the period covered by this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
PART II. Other Information
Item 1.    Legal Proceedings
ConocoPhillips has elected to use a $1 million threshold for disclosing certain proceedings arising under federal, state or local environmental laws when a governmental authority is a party. ConocoPhillips believes proceedings under this threshold are not material to ConocoPhillips' business and financial condition. Applying this threshold, there are no such proceedings to disclose for the quarter ended March 31, 2025.

Item 2.    Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds
Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities
*There were no repurchases of common stock from company employees in connection with the company's broad-based employee incentive plans.
In late 2016, we initiated our current share repurchase program. As of March 31, 2025, we had repurchased $35.8 billion of shares since 2016. In October 2024, our Board of Directors approved an increase from our previous authorization of $45 billion by a total of the lesser of $20 billion or the number of shares issued in our acquisition of Marathon Oil, such that the Company is not to exceed $65 billion in aggregate repurchases. Repurchases are made at management’s discretion, at prevailing prices, subject to market conditions and other factors. Except as limited by applicable legal requirements, repurchases may be increased, decreased or discontinued at any time without prior notice. Shares of stock repurchased under the plan are held as treasury shares.
