Note 1 — Basis of Presentation
The accompanying unaudited, condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared pursuant to rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and, therefore, do not include all information and footnote disclosures normally included in audited financial statements. However, in the opinion of management, all adjustments (which include only normal adjustments) necessary to present fairly the results of operations, financial position and cash flows have been made. It is suggested that these statements be read in conjunction with the financial statements included in Abbott’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024. The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the parent company and subsidiaries, after elimination of intercompany transactions.
Note 2 — New Accounting Standards
Recently Adopted Accounting Standards
In November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2023-07,
Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures
, which expands the breadth and frequency of required segment disclosures. The guidance is required to be applied retrospectively to all periods presented in the financial statements. Abbott adopted the standard on January 1, 2024. The new standard did not have an impact on Abbott's consolidated financial statements, but required additional disclosures, retrospectively applied to all periods presented in Note 14 — Segment and geographic area information.
Recent Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted
In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03,
Income Statement (Subtopic 220-40):
Reporting Comprehensive Income - Expense Disaggregation Disclosures
, which requires an entity to disclose on an annual and interim basis, disaggregated information about specific income statement expense categories. The guidance should be applied prospectively with the option to apply the standard retrospectively. The standard becomes effective for Abbott for full year 2027 reporting. Abbott is currently evaluating the impact of this new standard on its consolidated financial statements.
In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09,
Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures
, which requires an entity to disclose annually additional information related to the company's income tax rate reconciliation and income taxes paid during the period. The guidance should be applied prospectively with the option to apply the standard retrospectively. The standard becomes effective for Abbott for full year 2025 reporting. Abbott is currently evaluating the impact of this new standard on its consolidated financial statements.

Note 3 — Revenue
Abbott’s revenues are derived primarily from the sale of a broad line of healthcare products under short-term receivable arrangements. Abbott has
four
reportable segments: Established Pharmaceutical Products, Diagnostic Products, Nutritional Products, and Medical Devices.
The following tables provide detail by sales category:
Remaining Performance Obligations
As of March 31, 2025, the estimated revenue expected to be recognized in the future related to performance obligations that are unsatisfied (or partially unsatisfied) was $
5.7
billion in the Diagnostic Products segment and $
423
million in the Medical Devices segment. Abbott expects to recognize revenue on approximately
55
percent of these remaining performance obligations over the next
24
months, approximately
17
percent over the subsequent
12
months and the remainder thereafter.

(Unaudited)
Note 3 — Revenue (Continued)
These performance obligations primarily reflect the future sale of reagents/consumables in contracts with minimum purchase obligations, extended warranty or service obligations related to previously sold equipment, and remote monitoring services related to previously implanted devices. Abbott has applied the practical expedient described in FASB Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 606-10-50-14 and has not included remaining performance obligations related to contracts with original expected durations of one year or less in the amounts above.
Other Contract Assets and Liabilities
Abbott discloses Trade receivables separately in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet at the net amount expected to be collected. Contract assets primarily relate to Abbott’s conditional right to consideration for work completed but not billed at the reporting date. Contract assets at the beginning and the end of the period, as well as the changes in the balance, were not significant.
Contract liabilities primarily relate to payments received from customers in advance of performance under the contract. Abbott’s contract liabilities arise primarily in the Medical Devices segment when payment is received upfront for various multi-period extended service arrangements.
Changes in the contract liabilities during the period are as follows:
Note 4 — Supplemental Financial Information
Shares of unvested restricted stock that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends are treated as participating securities and are included in the computation of earnings per share under the two-class method. Under the two-class method, net earnings are allocated between common shares and participating securities. Net earnings allocated to common shares for the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024 were $
1.3
billion and $
1.2
billion, respectively.
Other, net in Net cash from operating activities in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the first three months of 2025 includes $
235
million of pension contributions and the payment of cash taxes of $
255
million. The first three months of 2024 included $
280
million of pension contributions and the payment of cash taxes of $
225
million.
The following summarizes the activity for the first three months of 2025 related to the allowance for doubtful accounts as of March 31, 2025:

Note 4 — Supplemental Financial Information (Continued)
The allowance for doubtful accounts reflects the current estimate of credit losses expected to be incurred over the life of the accounts receivable. Abbott considers various factors in establishing, monitoring, and adjusting its allowance for doubtful accounts, including the aging of the accounts and aging trends, the historical level of charge-offs, and specific exposures related to particular customers. Abbott also monitors other risk factors and forward-looking information, such as country risk, when determining credit limits for customers and establishing adequate allowances.
The components of long-term investments are as follows:
The increase in Abbott’s long-term investments as of March 31, 2025 versus the balance as of December 31, 2024 primarily relates to additional investments, partially offset by the impairment of certain securities.
Abbott’s equity securities as of March 31, 2025 include $
301
million of investments in mutual funds that are held in a rabbi trust. These investments, which are specifically designated as available for the purpose of paying benefits under a deferred compensation plan, are not available for general corporate purposes and are subject to creditor claims in the event of insolvency.
Abbott also holds certain investments as of March 31, 2025 with a carrying value of $
152
million that are accounted for under the equity method of accounting and other equity investments with a carrying value of $
109
million that do not have a readily determinable fair value.
Note 5 — Changes In Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)
The changes in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of income taxes, are as follows:
Reclassified amounts for cash flow hedges are recorded as Cost of products sold. Net actuarial losses and prior service cost are included as a component of net periodic benefit costs; see Note 12 — Post-Employment Benefits for additional details.

23.4
billion at March 31, 2025 and $
23.1
billion
at December 31, 2024. The amount of goodwill related to reportable segments at March 31, 2025 was $
2.6
billion for the Established Pharmaceutical Products segment, $
285
million for the Nutritional Products segment, $
3.5
billion for the Diagnostic Products segment, and $
16.9
billion for the Medical Devices segment.
F
oreign currency translation adjustments increased goodwill by $
251
million in the first three months of 2025. There were
no
reductions of goodwill relating to impairments in the first three months of 2025.
The gross amount of amortizable intangible assets, primarily product rights and technology, was $
27.3
billion as of March 31, 2025 and $
27.1
billion as of December 31, 2024. Accumulated amortization was $
21.8
billion and $
21.3
billion as of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively. In the first three months of 2025, intangible assets increased
$
34
million due to foreign currency translation. Abbott’s estimated annual amortization expense for intangible assets is approximately $
1.7
billion in 2025, $
1.5
billion in 2026, $
1.2
billion in 2027, $
0.7
billion in 2028 and $
0.6
billion in 2029.
Indefinite-lived intangible assets, which relate to in-process research and development (IPR&D) acquired in a business combination, were $
784
million as of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024.
Note 7 — Restructuring Plans
In 2025, Abbott management approved plans to streamline operations in order to reduce costs and improve efficiencies in its diagnostic and medical devices businesses. In the three months ended March 31, 2025, Abbott recorded employee related severance and other charges of $
34
million, of which $
13
million was recorded in Cost of products sold, $
13
million was recorded in Research and development, and $
8
million was recorded in Selling, general and administrative expenses. Payments related to these actions totaled $
4
million in the first three months of 2025 and the remaining liabilities totaled $
30
million at March 31, 2025. In addition, Abbott recognized asset impairment charges of $
12
million related to these restructuring plans.
In 2024 and 2023, Abbott management approved plans to restructure or streamline various operations in order to reduce costs in its medical devices, diagnostic, nutritional and established pharmaceutical businesses, including the discontinuation of its ZonePerfect
®
product line in 2024.
In addition, Abbott recognized asset impairment charges of approximately $
30
million related to these restructuring plans in the first three months of 2024.
The following summarizes the activity related to these restructuring actions and the status of the related accruals as of March 31, 2025:

Note 8 — Incentive Stock Programs
In the first three months of 2025, Abbott granted
1,426,812
stock options,
354,001
restricted stock awards and
4,240,698
restricted stock units under its incentive stock program. At March 31, 2025,
50
million shares were reserved for future grants.
Information regarding the number of options outstanding and exercisable at March 31, 2025 is as follows:
The total unrecognized share-based compensation cost at March 31, 2025 amounted to $
790
million, which is expected to be recognized over the next
three years
.
Note 9 — Debt and Lines of Credit
On March 17, 2025, Abbott repaid the $
1.0
billion outstanding principal amount of its
2.95
% Notes upon maturity.
Note 10 — Financial Instruments, Derivatives and Fair Value Measures
Certain Abbott foreign subsidiaries enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage exposures to changes in foreign exchange rates, primarily for anticipated intercompany purchases by those subsidiaries whose functional currencies are not the U.S. dollar. These contracts, with gross notional amounts totaling $
7.0
billion at March 31, 2025 and  December 31, 2024, are designated as cash flow hedges of the variability of the cash flows due to changes in foreign exchange rates and are recorded at fair value. Accumulated gains and losses as of March 31, 2025 will be included in Cost of products sold at the time the products are sold, generally through the next
twelve
to
eighteen months
.
Abbott enters into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage currency exposures for foreign currency denominated third-party trade payables and receivables, and for intercompany loans and trade accounts payable where the receivable or payable is denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the entity. For intercompany loans, the contracts require Abbott to sell or buy foreign currencies, primarily European currencies, in exchange for primarily U.S. dollars and other European currencies. For intercompany and trade payables and receivables, the currency exposures are primarily the U.S. dollar and European currencies. At March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, Abbott held the gross notional amounts of $
16.2
billion
of such foreign currency forward exchange contracts.
Abbott has designated a yen-denominated,
5
-year term loan of $
612
million and $
583
million as of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively, as a hedge of the net investment in certain foreign subsidiaries. The change in the value of the debt, which is due to changes in foreign exchange rates, is recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax.
Abbott is a party to interest rate hedge contracts with a notional amount totaling $
1.2
billion at March 31, 2025 and $
2.2
billion at December 31, 2024 to manage its exposure to changes in the fair value of fixed-rate debt. The decrease from December 31, 2024 was due to the maturity of $
1.0
billion of interest rate hedge contracts in conjunction with long-term debt, both of which matured in March 2025.
These contracts are designated as fair value hedges of the variability of the fair value of fixed-rate debt due to changes in the long-term benchmark interest rates. The effect of the hedge is to change a fixed-rate interest obligation to a variable rate for that portion of the debt. Abbott records the contracts at fair value and adjusts the carrying amount of the fixed-rate debt by an offsetting amount.

Gains of $
34
million and $
92
million were recognized in the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively, related to foreign currency forward exchange contracts not designated as a hedge. These amounts are reported in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Earnings on the Net foreign exchange (gain) loss line.

The carrying values and fair values of certain financial instruments as of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024 are shown in the following table. The carrying values of all other financial instruments approximate their estimated fair values. The counterparties to financial instruments consist of select major international financial institutions. Abbott does not expect any losses from non-performance by these counterparties.
The fair value of the debt was determined based on significant other observable inputs, including current interest rates.

Note 10 — Financial Instruments, Derivatives and Fair Value Measures (Continued)
The following table summarizes the bases used to measure certain assets and liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis in the balance sheet:
The fair value of foreign currency forward exchange contracts is determined using a market approach, which utilizes values for comparable derivative instruments. The fair value of debt was determined based on the face value of the debt adjusted for the fair value of the interest rate swaps, which is based on a discounted cash flow analysis using significant other observable inputs. The fair value of the contingent consideration was determined based on independent appraisals at the time of acquisition, adjusted for the time value of money and other changes in fair value. The increase in the amount of contingent consideration from December 31, 2024 reflects a fair value adjustment for contingent consideration related to a previous business combination.
The maximum amount for certain contingent consideration is not determinable as it is based on a percent of certain sales. Excluding such contingent consideration, the maximum amount that may be due under the other contingent consideration arrangements was estimated at March 31, 2025 to be $
59
million, which is dependent upon attaining certain sales thresholds or upon the occurrence of certain events, such as regulatory approvals.

Note 11 — Litigation and Environmental Matters
Abbott has been identified as a potentially responsible party for investigation and cleanup costs at a number of locations in the United States and Puerto Rico under federal and state remediation laws and is investigating potential contamination at a number of company-owned locations. Abbott has recorded an estimated cleanup cost for each site for which management believes Abbott has a probable loss exposure. No individual site cleanup exposure is expected to exceed $
4
million, and the aggregate cleanup exposure is not expected to exceed $
10
million.
Abbott has been named as a defendant in a number of lawsuits alleging that its preterm infant formula and human milk fortifier products that contain cow’s milk cause an intestinal disease known as necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) and inadequately warn about the risk of NEC. These lawsuits claim that certain preterm infants suffered injury or death as a result of contracting NEC. In a trial held in July 2024, a jury in a Missouri state court awarded a plaintiff $
495
million in damages. Abbott stands by its products and the information it provided about them, and it appealed this jury’s verdict with the Missouri Court of Appeals in December 2024. In a trial held in October 2024 involving Abbott and another infant formula manufacturer and the treating hospital as co-defendants, a jury in a Missouri state court returned a unanimous verdict for Abbott and its co-defendants.
In December 2024, the
plaintiff filed a motion for a new trial. In March 2025, the Missouri state court granted the plaintiff’s motion for a new trial, and Abbott appealed the ruling to the Missouri Court of Appeals. Abbott does not believe that it is probable that a material loss will be incurred related to these lawsuits and therefore,
no
reserves have been recorded. Given the uncertainty as to the possible outcome in each of these lawsuits, Abbott is unable to reasonably estimate a range of possible loss related to these lawsuits.
Abbott is involved in various claims and legal proceedings, and Abbott estimates the range of possible loss for its legal proceedings and environmental exposures to be from approximately $
25
million to $
35
million. The recorded accrual balance at March 31, 2025 for these proceedings and exposures was approximately $
30
million. This accrual represents management’s best estimate of probable loss, as defined by FASB ASC No. 450, “Contingencies.” Within the next year, legal proceedings may occur that may result in a change in the estimated loss accrued by Abbott. While it is not feasible to predict the outcome of all such proceedings and exposures with certainty, management believes that their ultimate disposition should not have a material adverse effect on Abbott’s financial position, cash flows, or results of operations, except for the cases discussed in the second paragraph of this note, the resolution of which could be material to Abbott's financial position, cash flows or results of operations.
Note 12 — Post-Employment Benefits
Retirement plans consist of defined benefit, defined contribution, and medical and dental plans. Net periodic benefit costs, other than service costs, are recognized in the Other (income) expense, net line of the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Earnings.
Net costs recognized for Abbott’s major defined benefit plans and post-employment medical and dental benefit plans are as follows:

Note 12 — Post-Employment Benefits (Continued)
Abbott funds its domestic defined benefit plans according to Internal Revenue Service funding limitations. International pension plans are funded according to similar regulations. In the first three months of 2025 and 2024, $
235
million and $
280
million, respectively, were contributed to defined benefit plans. In the first three months of 2025 and 2024, $
75
million and $
28
million were contributed, respectively, to the post-employment medical and dental plans.
Note 13 — Taxes on Earnings
Taxes on earnings reflect the estimated annual effective rates and include charges for interest and penalties. In the first three months of 2025 and 2024, taxes on earnings include $
73
million and $
25
million, respectively, in excess tax benefits associated with share-based compensation. The 2025 taxes on earnings includes approximately $
200
million of tax expense related to a deferred tax asset that was recognized as a significant non-cash tax benefit in a prior year. In the first three months of 2024, taxes on earnings also included approximately $
10
million of tax expense as the result of the resolution of various tax positions related to prior years.
In September 2023, Abbott received a Statutory Notice of Deficiency (SNOD) from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for the 2019 Federal tax year in the amount of $
417
million. The primary adjustments proposed in the SNOD relate to the reallocation of income between Abbott’s U.S. entities and its foreign affiliates. Abbott believes that the income reallocation adjustments proposed in the SNOD are without merit, in part because certain adjustments contradict methods that were agreed to with the IRS in prior audit periods. The SNOD also contains other proposed adjustments that Abbott believes are erroneous and unsupported. Abbott filed a petition with the U.S. Tax Court contesting the SNOD in December 2023.
In June 2024, Abbott received a SNOD from the IRS for the 2017 and 2018 Federal tax years in the amount of $
192
million. The matters proposed in the 2017/2018 SNOD are substantially similar to the income allocation adjustments included in the 2019 SNOD. Abbott filed a petition in September 2024 with the U.S. Tax Court contesting the 2017/2018 SNOD in a manner consistent with its petition for the 2019 SNOD.
In October 2024, Abbott received a SNOD from the IRS for the 2020 Federal tax year assessing an additional $
443
million of income tax. The primary adjustments proposed in the SNOD are substantially similar to the income allocation adjustments included in the 2017/2018 and 2019 SNODs. Abbott believes that the income reallocation adjustments proposed in the SNOD are without merit. The SNOD also contains other proposed adjustments and omissions that Abbott believes are erroneous and unsupported. In addition to the tax assessment for the 2020 tax year, the 2020 SNOD also contested a deduction for which an estimated $
440
million cash tax benefit would be available in a different taxable year as allowed under applicable U.S. tax law. Abbott filed a petition with the U.S. Tax Court contesting the SNOD in December 2024.
Abbott intends to vigorously defend its filing positions through ongoing discussions with the IRS, the IRS independent appeals process and/or through litigation as necessary. Abbott reserves for uncertain tax positions related to unresolved matters with the IRS and other taxing authorities. Abbott continues to believe that its reserves for uncertain tax positions are appropriate.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation & Development (OECD) has proposed a two-pillared plan for a revised international tax system. Pillar 1 proposes to reallocate taxing rights among the jurisdictions in which in-scope multinational corporations operate. Abbott is continuing to analyze the Pillar 1 proposal. Pillar 2 proposes to assess a 15 percent minimum tax on the earnings of in-scope multinational corporations on a country-by-country basis. Numerous countries have enacted legislation to adopt the Pillar 2 model rules. The enactment of current Pillar 2 model rules did not and is not projected to have a material impact to Abbott's consolidated financial statements.

For segment reporting purposes, the Cardiac Rhythm Management, Electrophysiology, Heart Failure, Vascular, Structural Heart, Neuromodulation and Diabetes Care businesses are aggregated and reported as the Medical Devices segment.
Abbott’s underlying accounting records are maintained on a legal entity basis for government and public reporting requirements. Segment disclosures are on a performance basis consistent with internal management reporting. The chief operating decision maker (CODM) at Abbott is the Chief Executive Officer (CEO). The CODM primarily considers sales and operating margin to assess the performance of segments and to allocate resources, where segment operating margin profitability includes cost of products sold and operating expenses. The cost of some corporate functions and the cost of certain employee benefits are charged to segments at predetermined rates that approximate cost. Remaining costs, if any, are not allocated to segments. In addition, intangible asset amortization is not allocated to operating segments, and intangible assets and goodwill are not included in the measure of each segment’s assets.

Item 2.    Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
Financial Review — Results of Operations
Abbott’s revenues are derived primarily from the sale of a broad line of healthcare products under short-term receivable arrangements. Patent protection and licenses, technological and performance features, and inclusion of Abbott’s products under a contract most impact which products are sold; price controls, competition and rebates most impact the net selling prices of products; and foreign currency translation impacts the measurement of net sales and costs. Abbott’s primary products are medical devices, diagnostic testing products, nutritional products and branded generic pharmaceuticals.
The following tables detail sales by reportable segment for the three months ended March 31. Percent changes are versus the prior year and are based on unrounded numbers.

Table of Contents
The 6.8 percent increase in total net sales during the first quarter of 2025, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, primarily reflected higher sales in the Medical Devices, Established Pharmaceutical Products and Nutritional Products segments, fueled by higher sales of existing products as well as the introduction of new products. Diagnostic Products sales growth continued to be impacted by the d
ecline in COVID-19 testing-related sales and the impact of volume-based procurement programs in China
. COVID-19 testing-related sales were $84 million in the first quarter of 2025 compared to $204 million in the first quarter of 2024. Abbott’s net sales were unfavorably impacted by changes in foreign exchange rates in the first quarter as the relatively stronger U.S. dollar decreased total international sales by 4.5 percent and total sales by 2.8 percent.
The table below provides detail by sales category for the three months ended March 31. Percent changes are versus the prior year and are based on unrounded numbers.

Table of Contents
In the first three months of 2025, total Established Pharmaceutical Products sales, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, increased 7.8 percent. Excluding the unfavorable effect of foreign exchange, sales in Key Emerging Markets for Established Pharmaceutical Products increased 9.3 percent in the first three months of 2025, led by higher revenue in several countries and across several therapeutic areas, including cardiometabolic, gastroenterology, central nervous system/pain management and respiratory. Other Emerging Markets, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, increased by 3.1 percent in the first three months of 2025.
Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, total Nutritional Products sales in the first three months of 2025 increased 6.2 percent. In U.S. Pediatric Nutritionals, the 14.2 percent increase in sales in the first three months of 2025 reflects sales growth across the product portfolio. Excluding the effect of foreign exchange, the 4.8 percent decrease in International Pediatric Nutritionals sales in the first three months of 2025 reflects a decrease in sales in the Asia Pacific and Latin America regions, partially offset by increased sales in Canada and the Europe/Middle East regions.
In the first three months of 2025, U.S. and International Adult Nutritionals sales, excluding the effect of foreign exchange,   increased 1.1 percent and 10.6 percent, respectively, due to growth of Ensure
®
and Glucerna
®
product sales. U.S. Adult Nutritionals sales were partially offset by the discontinuation of the ZonePerfect
®
product line in March 2024.
Diagnostic Products sales decreased 4.9 percent in the first three months of 2025, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. In Core Laboratory, sales increased 0.9 percent in the first three months of 2025, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, due to continued deployment of Abbott's Alinity
®
testing platform, mostly offset by the
impact of volume-based procurement programs in China
. In Rapid Diagnostics, sales decreased 16.1 percent in the first three months of 2025, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, primarily due to lower demand for COVID-19 tests.
Excluding the effect of foreign exchange, total Medical Devices sales increased 12.6 percent in the first three months of 2025, led by growth in Diabetes Care, Structural Heart, Heart Failure and Electrophysiology. Higher Diabetes Care sales were driven by continued growth in Abbott's continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems. CGM systems sales totaled $1.7 billion and $1.5 billion in the first three months of 2025 and 2024, respectively. Excluding the effect of foreign exchange, CGM systems sales increased 21.6 percent in the first three months of 2025.
During the first three months of 2025, procedure volumes continued to increase across the cardiovascular and neuromodulation businesses. In Structural Heart, the 14.7 percent increase in sales, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, primarily reflects growth in Navitor
®
and TriClip
®
products. In Heart Failure, the 12.4 percent increase in sales, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, primarily reflects growth in chronic and acute pump products and related accessories. In Electrophysiology, the 9.9 percent increase in sales, excluding the effect of foreign exchange, primarily reflects higher procedure volumes and increased demand fo
r
diagnostic and mapping
catheters
.
In Rhythm Management, the 6.1 percent sales increase in the first three months of 2025, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, was primarily due to growth in Aveir
®
leadless pacemakers, partially offset by a decrease in traditional pacemaker and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator sales. In Vascular, the 5.7 percent increase in sales, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, was primarily due to growth in vascular imaging, vessel closure products and the Esprit™ (BTK) system, Abbott's below-the-knee resorbable stent.
In March 2025, Abbott obtained CE Mark for its Volt™ Pulse Field Ablation (PFA) System to treat patients with atrial fibrillation.
The gross profit margin percentage was 52.8 percent for the first quarter of 2025 compared to 50.5 percent for the first quarter of 2024. The increase in the first three months of 2025 reflects the favorable impacts of  gross margin improvement initiatives and foreign exchange.
Research and development (R&D) expenses increased $32 million to $716 million, or 4.6 percent, in the first quarter of 2025. The increase in R&D expense in the first three months of 2025 was primarily driven by higher spending on various projects.
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $102 million, or 3.5 percent, in the first quarter of 2025 as higher selling and marketing spending to drive growth across various businesses was partially offset by the favorable impact of foreign exchange.

Restructuring Plans
In 2025, Abbott management approved plans to streamline operations in order to reduce costs and improve efficiencies in its diagnostic and medical devices businesses. In the three months ended March 31, 2025, Abbott recorded employee related severance and other charges of $34 million, of which $13 million was recorded in Cost of products sold, $13 million was recorded in Research and development, and $8 million was recorded in Selling, general and administrative expenses. Payments related to these actions totaled $4 million in the first three months of 2025 and the remaining liabilities totaled $30 million at March 31, 2025. In addition, Abbott recognized asset impairment charges of $12 million related to these restructuring plans.
Other (Income) Expense, net
Other income, net increased from $111 million of income in the first quarter of 2024 to $127 million of income in the first quarter of 2025. The increase in the first three months of 2025 primarily reflects lower investment impairments and higher income associated with the non-service cost components of net pension and post-retirement medical benefit costs, partially offset by unfavorable changes in the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities related to previous business combinations.
Interest Expense, net
Interest expense, net decreased $12 million to $49 million in the first quarter of 2025. In the first quarter of 2025, interest expense decreased primarily as a result of the repayment of long-term debt in November of 2024 and March 2025, combined with an increase in interest income due to higher average cash and short-term investment balances versus the prior year.
Taxes on Earnings
Taxes on earnings reflect the estimated annual effective rates and include charges for interest and penalties. In the first three months of 2025 and 2024, taxes on earnings include $73 million and $25 million, respectively, in excess tax benefits associated with share-based compensation. The 2025 taxes on earnings includes approximately $200 million of tax expense related to a deferred tax asset that was recognized as a significant non-cash tax benefit in a prior year. In the first three months of 2024, taxes on earnings also included approximately $10 million of tax expense as the result of the resolution of various tax positions related to prior years.
In September 2023, Abbott received a Statutory Notice of Deficiency (SNOD) from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for the 2019 Federal tax year in the amount of $417 million. The primary adjustments proposed in the SNOD relate to the reallocation of income between Abbott’s U.S. entities and its foreign affiliates. Abbott believes that the income reallocation adjustments proposed in the SNOD are without merit, in part because certain adjustments contradict methods that were agreed to with the IRS in prior audit periods. The SNOD also contains other proposed adjustments that Abbott believes are erroneous and unsupported. Abbott filed a petition with the U.S. Tax Court contesting the SNOD in December 2023.
In June 2024, Abbott received a SNOD from the IRS for the 2017 and 2018 Federal tax years in the amount of $192 million. The matters proposed in the 2017/2018 SNOD are substantially similar to the income allocation adjustments included in the 2019 SNOD. Abbott filed a petition in September 2024 with the U.S. Tax Court contesting the 2017/2018 SNOD in a manner consistent with its petition for the 2019 SNOD.
In October 2024, Abbott received a SNOD from the IRS for the 2020 Federal tax year assessing an additional $443 million of income tax. The primary adjustments proposed in the SNOD are substantially similar to the income allocation adjustments included in the 2017/2018 and 2019 SNODs. Abbott believes that the income reallocation adjustments proposed in the SNOD are without merit. The SNOD also contains other proposed adjustments and omissions that Abbott believes are erroneous and unsupported. In addition to the tax assessment for the 2020 tax year, the 2020 SNOD also contested a deduction for which an estimated $440 million cash tax benefit would be available in a different taxable year as allowed under applicable U.S. tax law. Abbott filed a petition with the U.S. Tax Court contesting the SNOD in December 2024.

Abbott intends to vigorously defend its filing positions through ongoing discussions with the IRS, the IRS independent appeals process and/or through litigation as necessary. Abbott reserves for uncertain tax positions related to unresolved matters with the IRS and other taxing authorities. Abbott continues to believe that its reserves for uncertain tax positions are appropriate.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation & Development (OECD) has proposed a two-pillared plan for a revised international tax system. Pillar 1 proposes to reallocate taxing rights among the jurisdictions in which in-scope multinational corporations operate. Abbott is continuing to analyze the Pillar 1 proposal. Pillar 2 proposes to assess a 15 percent minimum tax on the earnings of in-scope multinational corporations on a country-by-country basis. Numerous countries have enacted legislation to adopt the Pillar 2 model rules. The enactment of current Pillar 2 model rules did not and is not projected to have a material impact to Abbott's consolidated financial statements.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
The decrease in cash and cash equivalents from $7.6 billion at December 31, 2024 to $6.5 billion at March 31, 2025  reflects the repayment of debt in March 2025 of $1.0 billion, the payment of dividends and capital expenditures in the first three months of 2025, partially offset by cash generated from operations. Working capital was $10.1 billion at March 31, 2025 and $9.5 billion at December 31, 2024. The increase in working capital in 2025 primarily reflects increases in inventory and trade receivables.
In the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, Net cash from operating activities for the first three months of 2025 totaled $1.4 billion, an increase of $392 million from the prior year, primarily due to higher segment operating earnings.
In the first three months of 2025, Net cash from operating activities included $235 million of pension contributions and the payment of cash taxes of $255 million. Net cash from operating activities in 2024 included $280 million of pension contributions and the payment of cash taxes of $225 million.
At March 31, 2025, Abbott’s long-term debt rating was AA- by S&P Global Ratings and Aa3 by Moody’s Investors Service. Abbott expects to maintain an investment grade rating.
On March 17, 2025, Abbott repaid the $1.0 billion outstanding principal amount of its 2.95% Notes upon maturity.
In October 2024, the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $7 billion of Abbott common shares, from time to time. The new authorization is in addition to the $293 million unused portion of the share repurchase program authorized in December 2021.
In the first quarter of 2025, Abbott declared a quarterly dividend of $0.59 per share on its common shares, which represents an increase of 7.3 percent over the $0.55 per share dividend declared in the first quarter of 2024.
Legislative Issues
Abbott’s primary markets are highly competitive and subject to substantial government regulations throughout the world. Abbott expects debate to continue over the availability, method of delivery, and payment for healthcare products and services. It is not possible to predict the extent to which Abbott or the healthcare industry in general might be adversely affected by these factors in the future. A more complete discussion of these factors is contained in Item 1, Business, and Item 1A, Risk Factors, in the 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 — A Caution Concerning Forward-Looking Statements
Under the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Abbott cautions that any forward-looking statements made by Abbott are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Economic, competitive, governmental, technological and other factors that may affect Abbott's operations are discussed in Item 1A, "Risk Factors" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024, and are incorporated herein by reference. Abbott undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of subsequent events or developments, except as required by law.

Controls and Procedures
(a)
Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures.
The Chief Executive Officer, Robert B. Ford, and Chief Financial Officer, Philip P. Boudreau, evaluated the effectiveness of Abbott Laboratories’ disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report, and concluded that Abbott Laboratories’ disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information Abbott is required to disclose in the reports that it files or submits with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “Commission”) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Commission’s rules and forms, and to ensure that information required to be disclosed by Abbott in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to Abbott’s management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
(b)
Changes in internal control over financial reporting.
During the quarter ended March 31, 2025, there were no changes in Abbott’s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, Abbott’s internal control over financial reporting.
PART II. OTHER INFORMATION
Item 1.
Legal Proceedings
Abbott is involved in various claims, legal proceedings and investigations as described in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024 (the “2024 10-K”), including those described below (as of March 31, 2025, except where noted below). While it is not feasible to predict the outcome of such pending claims, proceedings, and investigations with certainty, management is of the opinion that their ultimate resolution should not have a material adverse effect on Abbott's financial position, cash flows, or results of operations.
In the 2024 10-K, Abbott reported that it is a defendant in numerous lawsuits alleging that preterm infants developed necrotizing enterocolitis as a result of being administered Abbott’s preterm infant formula products. Abbott further reported in the 2024 10-K that in a trial held in October 2024 involving Abbott and another infant formula manufacturer and the treating hospital as co-defendants, a jury in a Missouri state court returned a unanimous verdict for Abbott and its co-defendants and that in December 2024, the plaintiff filed a motion for a new trial. In March 2025, the Missouri state court granted the plaintiff’s motion for a new trial, and Abbott appealed the ruling to the Missouri Court of Appeals.
