Note 1 –
Basis of Presentation
The condensed consolidated interim financial statements included in this report have been prepared by management of The Boeing Company (herein referred to as “Boeing”, the “Company”, “we”, “us”, or “our”). In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) necessary for a fair presentation are reflected in the interim financial statements. The results of operations for the period ended March 31, 2025, are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for the full year. The interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited Consolidated Financial Statements, including the notes thereto, included in our 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Goodwill
Our Military Aircraft reporting unit within our Defense, Space & Security (BDS) segment had goodwill of $
1,295
and a negative carrying value at March 31, 2025.
Long-term Contracts
Substantially all contracts at our BDS segment and certain contracts at our Global Services (BGS) segment are long-term contracts with the U.S. government and other customers that generally extend over several years. Changes in estimated revenues, cost of sales, and the related effect on operating income are recognized using a cumulative catch-up adjustment which recognizes, in the current period, the cumulative effect of the changes on current and prior periods based on a long-term contract’s percentage-of-completion. When the current estimates of total revenues and costs at completion for a long-term contract indicate a loss, a provision for the entire reach-forward loss on the long-term contract is recognized.
The table below reflects the impact of net cumulative catch-up adjustments for changes in estimated revenues and costs at completion across all long-term contracts, including the impact to Earnings/(loss) from operations from changes in estimated losses on unexercised options.
Note 2 –
Spirit Acquisition
On June 30, 2024, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Merger Agreement) pursuant to which we have agreed to acquire Spirit AeroSystems Holdings, Inc. (Spirit) in an all-stock transaction at an equity value of approximately $
4,700
, or $
37.25
per share of Spirit Class A Common Stock. The transaction will include the assumption of Spirit's net debt at closing.
7
Table of Contents
Each share of Spirit common stock will be exchanged for a number of shares of Boeing common stock equal to an exchange ratio between
0.18
and
0.25
, calculated as $
37.25
divided by the volume weighted average share price of Boeing shares over the
15
-trading-day period ending on the second trading day prior to the closing (subject to a floor of $
149.00
per share and a ceiling of $
206.94
per share). Spirit stockholders will receive
0.25
Boeing shares for each of their Spirit shares if the volume-weighted average price is at or below $
149.00
, and
0.18
Boeing shares for each of their Spirit shares if the volume-weighted average price is at or above $
206.94
per share.
Boeing's acquisition of Spirit will include substantially all Boeing-related commercial operations, as well as certain other operations.
Spirit has also entered into a binding term sheet with Airbus SE (Airbus) setting forth the terms upon which Airbus will, assuming the parties enter into definitive agreements and receive all required regulatory approvals, acquire certain commercial work packages that Spirit performs for Airbus concurrently with the closing of the Boeing-Spirit merger. In addition, Spirit is selling certain of its other operations.
The transaction is expected to close mid-2025 and is subject to the sale of the Spirit operations related to certain Airbus commercial work packages and the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including certain regulatory approvals. On January 31, 2025, Spirit's stockholders approved the Merger Agreement and the related transactions.
The Merger Agreement contains certain termination rights, including that either Boeing or Spirit may terminate the Merger Agreement if, subject to certain limitations, the transaction has not been consummated by March 31, 2025 (subject to
three
automatic three-month extensions if on each such date or the last day of each extension period, as applicable
,
all of the closing conditions except those relating to regulatory approvals have been satisfied or waived) (the Outside Date). The first automatic extension is now in effect. Accordingly, the Outside Date is currently June 30, 2025. If either party breaches or fails to perform any of its representations, warranties or covenants under the Merger Agreement such that the related conditions to the other party's obligation to consummate the Merger would not be satisfied, and such breach or failure is not curable by the Outside Date or, if curable by the Outside Date, has not been cured within
30
days following notice thereof, such other party may terminate the Merger Agreement.
The Merger Agreement also provides that we will be required to pay Spirit a termination fee of $
300
if the Merger Agreement is terminated by Spirit or Boeing under certain specified circumstances as a result of the parties' failure to obtain the required regulatory approvals by the Outside Date or in the event that any law or order related to the required regulatory approvals or any applicable antitrust law or foreign investment law prohibits the consummation of the Merger.
During 2023 and 2024, Boeing reached agreements to provide Spirit up to $
1,067
to support its liquidity, rate readiness, and 787 tooling and capital expenditures, of which $
166
has yet to be drawn. At March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, Other current assets included $
24
and $
539
and Other assets included $
784
and $
299
. At March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, advance payments to Spirit of $
162
and $
165
were included in Inventories and are scheduled to be recovered as the related shipsets are received by Boeing from Spirit.
On January 22, 2025, Boeing and Spirit reached an agreement to reschedule repayment dates for $
515
to 2026. This includes changing repayment of $
425
originally due in 2024 to 2026. In the event that the Merger Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms, the then outstanding balances will become due and payable in full on April 1, 2026.

Note 3 –
Earnings Per Share
Basic and diluted earnings per share are computed using the two-class method, which is an earnings allocation method that determines earnings per share for common shares and participating securities. The undistributed earnings are allocated between common shares and participating securities as if all earnings had been distributed during the period. Participating securities and common shares have equal rights to undistributed earnings.
Basic earnings per share is calculated by taking net earnings attributable to Boeing shareholders, less Mandatory convertible preferred stock dividends accumulated during the period and earnings available to participating securities, divided by the basic weighted average common shares outstanding.
Diluted earnings per share is calculated by taking net earnings attributable to Boeing shareholders, less Mandatory convertible preferred stock dividends accumulated during the period and earnings available to participating securities, divided by the diluted weighted average common shares outstanding. Diluted weighted average common shares outstanding is calculated using the treasury stock method for share-based compensation awards and the if-converted method for Mandatory convertible preferred stock.
The elements used in the computation of Basic and Diluted loss per share were as follows:
(1)
Participating securities include certain instruments in our deferred compensation plan.
The following table represents potential common shares that were not included in the computation of Diluted loss per share because the effect was antidilutive based on their strike price or the performance condition was not met.
9
Table of Contents
In addition, potential common shares of
37.1
million and
3.1
million for the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024 were excluded from the computation of Diluted loss per share, because the effect would have been antidilutive as a result of incurring a net loss in those periods.
Note 4 –
Income Taxes
Our effective tax rates were
140.8
% and
6.1
% for the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024. The effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2025, primarily reflects an increase in the domestic income tax valuation allowance treated as a discrete expense.
As of December 31, 2024, we had recorded valuation allowances of $
7,837
primarily for certain domestic deferred tax assets, and certain domestic net operating losses, tax credits and interest carryforwards. To measure the valuation allowance, the Company estimated in what year each of its deferred tax assets and liabilities would reverse using systematic and logical methods to estimate the reversal patterns. The valuation allowance results from not having sufficient income from deferred tax liability reversals in the appropriate future periods to support the realization of deferred tax assets.
Federal income tax audits have been settled for all years prior to 2021. We expect the next cycle to cover the 2021-2023 tax years; however, the Internal Revenue Service has not confirmed a start date. We are also subject to examination in major state and international jurisdictions for the 2010-2023 tax years. We believe appropriate provisions for all outstanding tax issues have been made for all jurisdictions and all open years.

Contracts with Customers
Unbilled receivables increased from $
8,363
at December 31, 2024, to $
9,031
at March 31, 2025, primarily driven by revenue recognized in excess of billings at BDS.
Advances and progress billings increased from $
60,333
at December 31, 2024, to $
61,114
at March 31, 2025, primarily driven by advances on orders received at Commercial Airplanes (BCA) and BGS, partially offset by revenue recognized at BDS.
Revenues recognized during the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, from amounts recorded as Advances and progress billings at the beginning of each year were $
5,488
and $
4,181

Financing Receivables and Operating Lease Equipment
Financing receivables and operating lease equipment, net consisted of the following:
Our financing arrangements range in terms from
1
to
7
years, and include $
191
of Investment in sales-type leases, net of allowances, that will be repaid in
one year
or less. Financing arrangements may include options to extend or terminate. Certain leases include provisions to allow the lessee to purchase the underlying aircraft at a specified price. At March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, $
4
and $
7
were determined to be uncollectible financing receivables and placed on non-accrual status. The allowance for losses on financing receivables decreased primarily due to cash collections during the three months ended March 31, 2025.
The components of investment in sales-type leases consisted of the following:
Financing interest income recorded for the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, was $
2
and $

.
Our financing receivable balances at March 31, 2025 by internal credit rating category and year of origination consisted of the following:
At March 31, 2025, our allowance for losses related to receivables with ratings of CCC, B and BBB. We applied default rates that averaged
100.0
%,
0.0
% and
0.1
%, respectively, to the exposure associated with those receivables.

Liabilities, Commitments and Contingencies
737 MAX Customer Concessions and Other Considerations
During the first quarter of 2024, we recorded an earnings charge of $
443
, net of insurance recoveries, in connection with estimated considerations to customers for disruption related to the January 2024 737-9 door plug accident and 737-9 grounding. This charge is reflected in the financial statements as a reduction to Sales of products.
The following table summarizes changes in the 737 MAX customer concessions and other considerations liability during the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024.
At March 31, 2025, $
92
of the liability balance remains subject to negotiations with customers. The contracted amount includes $
109
expected to be paid in cash primarily in 2025, while the remaining amounts are primarily expected to be liquidated by lower customer delivery payments.
Environmental
The following table summarizes changes in environmental remediation liabilities during the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024.
The liabilities recorded represent our best estimate or the low end of a range of reasonably possible costs expected to be incurred to remediate sites, including operation and maintenance over periods of up to
30
years. It is reasonably possible that we may incur costs that exceed these recorded amounts because of regulatory agency orders and directives, changes in laws and/or regulations, higher than expected costs and/or the discovery of new or additional contamination. As part of our estimating process, we develop a range of reasonably possible alternate scenarios that includes the high end of a range of reasonably possible cost estimates for all remediation sites for which we have sufficient information based on our experience and existing laws and regulations. There are some potential remediation obligations where the costs of remediation cannot be reasonably estimated. At March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, the high end of the estimated range of reasonably possible remediation costs exceeded our recorded liabilities by $
996
and $
1,002
.

Product Warranties
The following table summarizes changes in product warranty liabilities recorded during the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024.
Commercial Aircraft Trade-In Commitments
In conjunction with signing definitive agreements for the sale of new aircraft, we have entered into trade-in commitments with certain customers that give them the right to trade in used aircraft at a specified price. The probability that trade-in commitments will be exercised is determined by using both quantitative information from valuation sources and qualitative information from other sources. The probability of exercise is assessed quarterly, or as events trigger a change, and takes into consideration the current economic and airline industry environments. Trade-in commitments, which can be terminated by mutual consent with the customer, may be exercised only during the period specified in the agreement, and require advance notice by the customer.
Trade-in commitment agreements at March 31, 2025, have expiration dates from 2025 through 2032. At March 31, 2025, and December 31, 2024, total contractual trade-in commitments were $
1,512
and $
1,393
. As of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, we estimated it was probable we would be obligated to perform on certain of these commitments with net amounts payable to customers totaling $
71
and $
275
and the fair value of the related trade-in aircraft was $
67
and $
270
.
Financing Commitments
Financing commitments related to aircraft on order, including options and those proposed in sales campaigns, and refinancing of delivered aircraft, totaled $
17,157
and $
17,124
as of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024.
The estimated earliest potential funding dates for these commitments as of March 31, 2025 are as follows:
As of March 31, 2025, $
13,832
of these financing commitments relate to customers we believe have less than investment-grade credit. We have concluded that no reserve for future potential losses is required for these financing commitments based upon the terms, such as collateralization and interest rates, under which funding would be provided.
Other Financial Commitments
We have financial commitments to make additional capital contributions totaling $
277
to certain joint ventures over the next
eight years
.

Table of Contents
Standby Letters of Credit and Surety Bonds
We have entered into standby letters of credit and surety bonds with financial institutions primarily relating to the guarantee of our future performance on certain contracts and security agreements. Contingent liabilities on outstanding letters of credit agreements and surety bonds aggregated approximately
$
3,036
and $
2,991
as of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024.
Supply Chain Financing Programs
The Company has supply chain financing programs in place under which participating suppliers may elect to obtain payment from an intermediary. The Company confirms the validity of invoices from participating suppliers and agrees to pay the intermediary an amount based on invoice totals. The majority of amounts payable under these programs are due within
30
to
90
days but may extend up to
12
months. At March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, Accounts payable included $
2,107
and $
2,703
payable to suppliers who have elected to participate in these programs. We do not believe that future changes in the availability of supply chain financing would have a significant impact on our liquidity.
Recoverable Costs on Government Contracts
Our final incurred costs for each year are subject to audit and review for allowability by the U.S. government, which can result in payment demands related to costs they believe should be disallowed. We work with the U.S. government to assess the merits of claims and where appropriate reserve for amounts disputed. If we are unable to satisfactorily resolve disputed costs, we could be required to record an earnings charge and/or provide refunds to the U.S. government. In March 2025, the U.S. Air Force (USAF) announced that Boeing has been awarded a contract to design, build and deliver the F-47, its next-generation fighter aircraft. We are making certain capital expenditures that have risk for impairment pending completion of the source selection and evaluation review process for the next-generation fighter aircraft. Total capital investment was approximately $
500
at March 31, 2025.
Fixed-Price Contracts
Long-term contracts that are contracted on a fixed-price basis could result in losses in future periods. Certain of the fixed-price contracts are for the development of new products, services and related technologies. Estimating the cost and time for us and our suppliers to complete these contracts is inherently uncertain due to operational and technical complexities. This uncertainty requires us to make significant judgments and assumptions about future operational and technical performance, and the outcome of customer and/or supplier contractual negotiations. The risk that actual performance, technical or contractual outcomes could be different than those previously assumed creates financial risk that could trigger additional material earnings charges, termination provisions, order cancellations, or other financially significant exposure.
VC-25B Presidential Aircraft
The Company’s firm fixed-price contract for the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) effort on the USAF's VC-25B Presidential Aircraft, commonly known as Air Force One, is a $
4
billion program to develop and modify
two
747-8 commercial aircraft. During 2024, we increased the reach-forward loss on the contract by $
379
. We are continuing to work with the customer to reset the schedule as they adjust requirements. Risk remains that we may record additional losses in future periods.
KC-46A Tanker
In 2011, we were awarded a contract from the USAF to design, develop, manufacture, and deliver
four
next-generation aerial refueling tankers as well as priced options for
13
annual production lots totaling
179
aircraft. Since 2016, the USAF has authorized
11
low rate initial production (LRIP) lots for a total of
154
aircraft. The EMD contract and authorized LRIP lots total approximately $
29
billion as of March 31, 2025. The KC-46A Tanker is a derivative of the 767 commercial airplane program with the majority of the manufacturing costs being incurred in the 767 factory and the remaining costs being incurred in the military finishing and delivery centers. During 2024, we increased the reach-forward loss on the KC-46A
16
Table of Contents
Tanker program by $
2,002
. As of March 31, 2025, we had approximately $
107
of capitalized precontract costs and $
183
of potential termination liabilities to suppliers related to future production lots. Risk remains that we may record additional losses in future periods.
MQ-25
In the third quarter of 2018, we were awarded the MQ-25 EMD contract by the U.S. Navy. The contract is a fixed-price contract that now includes development and delivery of
seven
aircraft and test articles at a contract price of $
890
. In connection with winning the competition, we recognized a reach-forward loss of $
291
in the third quarter of 2018. In the first quarter of 2024, we were awarded a cost-type contract modification totaling $
657
for
two
additional test aircraft plus other scope increases. During 2024, we increased the reach-forward loss by $
339
. We expect the initial EMD units to complete production in 2025 and begin flight testing. During the first quarter of 2025, we initiated final assembly operations at our new facility at Mid-America St. Louis Airport in Mascoutah, Illinois. Risk remains that we may record additional losses in future periods.
T-7A Red Hawk EMD Contract & Production Options
In 2018, we were awarded the T-7A Red Hawk program. The EMD portion of the contract is a $
860
fixed-price contract and includes
five
aircraft and
seven
simulators. The production portion of the contract includes production lots for 346 T-7A Red Hawk aircraft and related services that we believe are probable of being exercised. The
five
EMD aircraft were delivered as of December 31, 2024, and the flight testing is ongoing. In January 2025, the USAF announced an updated acquisition approach for the T-7A Red Hawk that allows the Company to provide a production-ready configuration to the customer prior to low-rate initial production, which better supports the operational needs of the customer and reduces future production risk. During 2024, we increased the reach-forward loss on the T-7A Red Hawk program by $
1,770
. At March 31, 2025, we had approximately $
361
of capitalized precontract costs and $
783
of potential termination liabilities to suppliers related to certain long-lead items for the first
4
production lots. Risk remains that we may record additional losses in future periods.
Commercial Crew
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has contracted us to design and build the CST-100 Starliner spacecraft to transport crews to the International Space Station (ISS). During 2024, we increased the reach-forward loss by $
523
. We are continuing to work toward crew certification and resolve the propulsion system anomalies. At March 31, 2025, we had approximately $
401
of capitalized precontract costs and $
147
of potential termination liabilities to suppliers related to unauthorized future missions. Risk remains that we may record additional losses in future periods.
Note 11 –
Arrangements with Off-Balance Sheet Risk
We enter into arrangements with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business, primarily in the form of guarantees.
The following table provides quantitative data regarding our third-party guarantees. The maximum potential payments represent a “worst-case scenario” and do not necessarily reflect amounts that we expect to pay. The carrying amount of liabilities represents the amount included in Accrued liabilities.
Contingent Repurchase Commitments
In conjunction with signing a definitive agreement for the sale of commercial aircraft, we have entered into contingent repurchase commitments with certain customers wherein we agree to repurchase the sold aircraft at a specified price, generally
10
to
15
years after
17
Table of Contents
delivery. Our repurchase of the aircraft is contingent upon entering into a mutually acceptable agreement for the sale of additional new aircraft in the future. The commercial aircraft repurchase price specified in contingent repurchase commitments is generally lower than the expected fair value at the specified repurchase date. Estimated proceeds from collateral/recourse in the table above represent the lower of the contracted repurchase price or the expected fair value of each aircraft at the specified repurchase date.
If a future sale agreement is reached and a customer elects to exercise its right under a contingent repurchase commitment, the contingent repurchase commitment becomes a trade-in commitment. Our historical experience is that contingent repurchase commitments infrequently become trade-in commitments.
Credit Guarantees
We have issued credit guarantees where we are obligated to make payments to a guaranteed party in the event that the original lessee or debtor does not make payments or perform certain specified services. Generally, these guarantees have been extended on behalf of guaranteed parties with less than investment-grade credit. Current outstanding credit guarantees expire through 2036.
Other Indemnifications
In conjunction with our sales of Electron Dynamic Devices, Inc. and Rocketdyne Propulsion and Power businesses and our BCA facilities in Wichita, Kansas and Tulsa and McAlester, Oklahoma, we agreed to indemnify, for an indefinite period, the buyers for costs relating to pre-closing environmental conditions and certain other items. We are unable to assess the potential number of future claims that may be asserted under these indemnifications, nor the amounts thereof (if any). As a result, we cannot estimate the maximum potential amount of future payments under these indemnities. To the extent that claims have been made under these indemnities and/or are probable and reasonably estimable, liabilities associated with these indemnities are included in the environmental liability disclosure in Note 10.

Share-Based Compensation and Other Compensation Arrangements
Stock Options
On February 19, 2025, we granted
366,869
premium-priced stock options to our executive officers as part of our long-term incentive program. These stock options have an exercise price equal to
120.0
% of the fair market value of our stock on the date of grant. The stock options are scheduled to vest and become exercisable
three years
after the grant date and expire
ten years
after the grant date. If an executive terminates employment because of retirement, layoff, disability, or death, the executive (or beneficiary) may receive some or all of their stock options depending on certain age and service conditions. The fair value of the stock options granted was $
79.53
per unit and was estimated using a Monte-Carlo simulation model using the following assumptions: expected life
7.0
years, expected volatility
39.0
%, risk free interest rate
4.5
% and
no
expected dividend yield.
Restricted Stock Units
On February 19, 2025, we granted
2,244,444
restricted stock units (RSU) to our executives as part of our long-term incentive program. The RSUs granted under this program have a grant date fair value of $
184.53
per unit and will generally vest in three approximately equal installments on the first, second, and third anniversaries of the grant date. These RSUs will settle in common stock (on a one-for-one basis). If an executive terminates employment because of retirement, layoff, disability, or death, the executive (or beneficiary) may receive some or all of their stock units depending on certain age and service conditions. In all other cases, the RSUs will not vest and all rights to the stock units will terminate.

Derivative Financial Instruments
Cash Flow Hedges
Our cash flow hedges include foreign currency forward contracts, commodity swaps and commodity purchase contracts. We use foreign currency forward contracts to manage currency risk associated with certain expected sales and purchases through 2031. We use commodity derivatives, such as fixed-price purchase commitments and swaps to hedge against potentially unfavorable price changes for commodities used in production. Our commodity contracts hedge forecasted transactions through 2028.

Table of Contents
Derivative Instruments Not Receiving Hedge Accounting Treatment
We have entered into agreements to purchase and sell aluminum to address long-term strategic sourcing objectives and non-U.S. business requirements. These agreements are derivative instruments for accounting purposes. The quantities of aluminum in these agreements offset and are priced at prevailing market prices. We also hold certain foreign currency forward contracts and commodity swaps which do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment.
Notional Amounts and Fair Values
The notional amounts and fair values of derivative instruments in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Position were as follows:
(1)
Notional amounts represent the gross contract/notional amount of the derivatives outstanding.
Gains/(losses) associated with our hedging transactions and forward points recognized in Other comprehensive income/(loss) are presented in the following table:
(Losses)/gains associated with our hedging transactions and forward points reclassified from AOCI to earnings are presented in the following table:

Gains/(losses) related to undesignated derivatives on foreign exchange and commodity cash flow hedging transactions recognized in Other income, net were insignificant for the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024.
Based on our portfolio of cash flow hedges, we expect to reclassify losses of $
50
(pre-tax) out of AOCI into earnings during the next 12 months.
We have derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features. If we default on our
five-year
credit facilities, our derivative counterparties could require settlement for foreign exchange and certain commodity contracts with original maturities of at least
five years
. The fair value of those contracts in a net liability position at March 31, 2025 was $

. For other particular commodity contracts, our counterparties could require collateral posted in an amount determined by our credit ratings. At March 31, 2025, there was no collateral posted related to our derivatives.
Note 16 –
Fair Value Measurements
The fair value hierarchy has three levels based on the reliability of the inputs used to determine fair value. Level 1 refers to fair values determined based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. Level 2 refers to fair values estimated using significant other observable inputs, and Level 3 includes fair values estimated using significant unobservable inputs.
The following table presents our assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis and are categorized using the fair value hierarchy.
Money market funds, available-for-sale debt investments and equity securities are valued using a market approach based on the quoted market prices or broker/dealer quotes of identical or comparable instruments.
Derivatives include foreign currency and commodity contracts. Our foreign currency forward contracts are valued using an income approach based on the present value of the forward rate less the contract rate multiplied by the notional amount. Commodity derivatives are valued using an income approach based on the present value of the commodity index prices less the contract rate multiplied by the notional amount.
22
Table of Contents
Certain assets have been measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis.
The following table presents the nonrecurring losses recognized for the three months ended March 31 due to long-lived asset impairment and the fair value of the related assets as of the impairment date:
Level 3 Investments and Other assets were primarily valued using an income approach based on the discounted cash flows associated with the underlying assets. Level 2 Property, plant and equipment were valued based on a third-party valuation using a combination of income and market approaches and adjusted for as-is condition. These approaches are considered estimates of net operating income, capitalization rates, and/or comparable property sales. Level 3 operating lease equipment is derived by calculating a median collateral value from a consistent group of third-party aircraft value publications. The values provided by the third-party aircraft publications are derived from their knowledge of market trades and other market factors. Management reviews the publications quarterly to assess the continued appropriateness and consistency with market trends. Under certain circumstances, we adjust values based on the attributes and condition of the specific aircraft or equipment, usually when the features or use of the aircraft vary significantly from the more generic aircraft attributes covered by third-party publications, or on the expected net sales price for the aircraft.
Fair Value Disclosures
The fair values and related carrying values of financial instruments that are not required to be remeasured at fair value on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Position were as follows:
The fair value of Notes receivable classified as Level 2 is estimated with discounted cash flow analysis using interest rates currently offered on loans with similar terms to borrowers of similar credit quality. The fair value of Notes receivable classified as Level 3 is based on our best estimate using available counterparty financial data. The fair value of our debt that is traded in the secondary market is classified as Level 2 and is based on current market yields. For our debt that is not traded in the secondary market, the fair value is classified as Level 2 and is based on our indicative borrowing cost derived from dealer

Table of Contents
quotes or discounted cash flows. With regard to other financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk, it is not practicable to estimate the fair value of our indemnifications and financing commitments because the amount and timing of those arrangements are uncertain. Items not included in the above disclosures include cash, restricted cash, time deposits and other deposits, commercial paper, money market funds, Accounts receivable, Unbilled receivables, Other current assets, Accounts payable and long-term payables. The carrying values of those items, as reflected in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Position, approximate their fair value at March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024. The fair value of assets and liabilities whose carrying value approximates fair value is determined using Level 2 inputs, with the exception of cash (Level 1).
Note 17 –
Legal Proceedings
Various legal proceedings, claims and investigations related to products, contracts, employment, securities and other matters are pending against us. In addition, we are subject to various government inquiries and investigations from which civil, criminal or administrative proceedings could result or have resulted in the past. Such proceedings involve or could involve claims by the government for fines, penalties, compensatory and treble damages, restitution and/or forfeitures. Under U.S. government regulations, a company, or one or more of its operating divisions or subdivisions, can also be suspended or debarred from government contracts, have certain of its production certificates suspended or revoked, or lose its export privileges, based on the results of investigations. We believe, based upon current information, that the outcome of any currently pending legal proceeding, claim, or government dispute, inquiry or investigation will not have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
Multiple legal actions, investigations and inquiries were initiated concerning the October 29, 2018 accident of Lion Air Flight 610 and the March 10, 2019 accident of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302. While many of these legal actions and investigations have been resolved, others are still pending, including a federal securities class action filed in federal district court in the Northern District of Illinois, and a number of civil lawsuits and claims brought by family members of those lost in the accidents. Furthermore, on January 7, 2021, we entered into a Deferred Prosecution Agreement (DPA) with the U.S. Department of Justice (the Department) relating to the Department’s investigation into us regarding the evaluation of the 737 MAX by the Federal Aviation Administration (the Investigation). Among other obligations, the DPA included a three-year reporting period, which ended in January 2024. On May 14, 2024, the Department notified us of its determination that we did not fulfill our obligations under the DPA and that the Department would not move to dismiss the case. On July 24, 2024, we and the Department filed a proposed plea agreement with the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas (the Court) to resolve the Investigation. Under the terms of the proposed agreement, Boeing agreed that it would plead guilty to the charge that was the basis for the DPA; pay an additional fine of $
244
; commit to invest at least $
455
in compliance, quality and safety programs over a
three-year
period; and agree to the appointment of an independent compliance monitor for
three years
. On December 5, 2024, the Court rejected the proposed plea agreement, citing the proposed agreement’s provisions governing the monitor’s selection and supervision. In light of the Court’s ruling, Boeing and the Department continue to be engaged in discussions regarding potential resolution of this matter, which is now scheduled to go to trial on June 23, 2025.
Multiple legal actions were initiated as a result of the January 5, 2024 737-9 door plug accident. We are also subject to multiple governmental and regulatory investigations and inquiries relating to the 737-9 door plug accident and our commercial airplanes business.
We cannot reasonably estimate a range of loss, if any, not covered by available insurance and in excess of any accrued amounts that may result given the current status of pending lawsuits, investigations and inquiries arising from the 2018 and 2019 737 MAX accidents and the January 2024 737-9 door plug accident.

Segment and Revenue Information
We operate in
three
reportable segments: BCA, BDS, and BGS. All other activities fall within Unallocated items, eliminations and other. See page 6 for the Summary of Business Segment Data, which is an integral part of this note.
BCA develops, produces and markets commercial jet aircraft principally to the commercial airline industry worldwide. Revenue on commercial aircraft contracts is recognized at the point in time when an aircraft is completed and accepted by the customer.
BDS engages in the research, development, production and modification of the following products and related services: manned and unmanned military aircraft and weapons systems, surveillance and engagement, strategic defense and intelligence systems, satellite systems and space exploration. BDS revenue is generally recognized over the contract term (over time) as costs are incurred.
BGS provides parts, maintenance, modifications, logistics support, training, data analytics and information-based services to commercial and government customers worldwide. BGS segment revenue and costs include certain products and services provided to other segments. Revenue on commercial spare parts contracts is recognized at the point in time when a spare part is delivered to the customer. Revenue on other contracts is generally recognized over the contract term (over time) as costs are incurred.
The primary profitability measurement used by our chief operating decision maker to review segment operating results is Segment operating earnings/(loss).
The following table reconciles segment Revenues to Segment operating earnings/(loss):
(1)
Primarily includes costs of products and services and general and administrative expenses.
The following tables present BCA, BDS and BGS revenues from contracts with customers disaggregated in a number of ways, such as geographic location, contract type and the method of revenue recognition. We believe these best depict how the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of our revenues and cash flows are affected by economic factors

BCA revenues by customer location consisted of the following:
BDS revenues on contracts with customers, based on the customer's location, consisted of the following:

Earnings in Equity Method Investments
During the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, our share of (loss)/income from equity method investments was ($
4
) and $
72
. The loss in 2025 was primarily driven by investments held in Unallocated items, eliminations, and other. The income in 2024 was primarily driven by investments held at our BDS segment.
Backlog
Our total backlog includes contracts that we and our customers are committed to perform. The value in backlog represents the estimated transaction prices on performance obligations to our customers for which work remains to be performed. Backlog is converted into revenue, primarily based on the cost incurred or at delivery and acceptance of products, depending on the applicable revenue recognition model.
Our backlog at March 31, 2025 was $
544,736
. We expect approximately
24
% to be converted to revenue through 2026 and approximately
71
% through 2029, with the remainder thereafter. There is significant uncertainty regarding the timing of when backlog will convert into revenue. We may experience reductions to backlog and/or significant order cancellations due to various factors including delivery delays, production disruptions and delays to entry into service of the 777X, 737-7 and/or 737-10.
Unallocated Items, Eliminations and Other
Unallocated items, eliminations and other include common internal services that support Boeing’s global business operations and eliminations of certain sales between segments. We generally allocate costs to business segments based on the U.S. Government Cost Accounting Standards (CAS).
Components of Unallocated items, eliminations and other income/(expense) are shown in the following table.
27
Table of Contents
Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Expense
Pension costs are allocated to BDS and BGS businesses supporting government customers using CAS, which employ different actuarial assumptions and accounting conventions than GAAP. These costs are allocable to government contracts. Other postretirement benefit costs are allocated to business segments based on CAS, which is generally based on benefits paid. FAS/CAS service cost adjustment represents the difference between the Financial Accounting Standards (FAS) pension and postretirement service costs calculated under GAAP and costs allocated to the business segments. Non-operating pension and postretirement expenses represent the components of net periodic benefit costs other than service cost. These expenses are included in Other income, net.
Components of FAS/CAS service cost adjustment are shown in the following table:
Assets
Segment assets are summarized in the table below:
Assets included in Unallocated items, eliminations and other primarily consist of Cash and cash equivalents, Short-term and other investments, tax assets, capitalized interest and assets managed centrally on behalf of the
three
principal business segments and intercompany eliminations.

Table of Contents
Capital Expenditures
Capital expenditures for Unallocated items, eliminations and other relate primarily to assets managed centrally on behalf of the
three
principal business segments.
Depreciation and Amortization

Amounts shown in the table represent depreciation and amortization expense recorded by the individual business segments. Depreciation and amortization for centrally managed assets are allocated to business segments based on usage and occupancy. During the three months ended March 31, 2025, $
169
was allocated to the primary business segments, of which $
82
, $
68
, and $
19
was allocated to BCA, BDS and BGS, respectively. During the three months ended March 31, 2024, $
163
was allocated to the primary business segments, of which $
80
, $
65
, and $
18
was allocated to BCA, BDS and BGS, respectively.
Note 19 –
Subsequent Events
On April 22, 2025, we announced that we entered into an agreement with Thoma Bravo to sell portions of our BGS segment’s Digital Aviation Solutions business for $
10.55
billion. The sale will include Jeppesen, ForeFlight, AerData and OzRunways assets. We will continue to provide commercial and defense airplane and fleet maintenance, diagnostics, and repair services. This transaction will enable us to strengthen our capital structure and focus on our core operations. We expect the transaction to close later in 2025 and result in a gain at closing. The transaction is subject to regulatory approval and customary closing conditions.

Arlington, Virginia
Results of Review of Interim Financial Information
We have reviewed the accompanying condensed consolidated statement of financial position of The Boeing Company and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of March 31, 2025, the related condensed consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows for the three-month periods ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "condensed consolidated interim financial information"). Based on our reviews, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the accompanying condensed consolidated interim financial information for it to be in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
We have previously audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated statement of financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows for the year then ended (not presented herein); and in our report dated February 3, 2025, we expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. In our opinion, the information set forth in the accompanying condensed consolidated statement of financial position as of December 31, 2024, is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the consolidated statement of financial position from which it has been derived.
Basis for Review Results
This condensed consolidated interim financial information is the responsibility of the Company's management. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our reviews in accordance with standards of the PCAOB. A review of interim financial information consists principally of applying analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB, the objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.

Overview
On January 5, 2024, a 737-9 flight made an emergency landing after a mid-exit door plug detached in flight. Following the accident, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) grounded and required inspections of all 737-9 aircraft with a mid-exit door plug, which constituted the large majority of the approximately 220 737-9 aircraft in the in-service fleet. On January 24, 2024, the FAA approved an enhanced maintenance and inspection process that was required to be performed on each of the grounded 737-9 aircraft. Our 737-9 operators returned their fleets to service in the first quarter of 2024. All 737-9 aircraft in production are undergoing this same enhanced inspection process prior to delivery.
As a result of the accident, the FAA performed an investigation into the 737 quality control system. In the second quarter of 2024, we submitted a comprehensive safety and quality plan to the FAA to address the issues identified. As part of our plan to improve quality and safety and to address the issues identified, we slowed production rates and delayed planned production rate increases to reduce traveled work in our factory, as well as at our suppliers. We also began taking additional actions to improve safety and quality, which include investing in workforce training, simplifying plans and processes, eliminating defects, and enhancing our safety and quality culture.
The 737-9 door plug accident and the resulting actions to improve compliance with our manufacturing quality control requirements have significantly impacted our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
On November 4, 2024, the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers District 751 (IAM 751) voted to ratify a new contract, thereby ending the work stoppage initiated on September 13, 2024, which paused production of certain commercial aircraft models (737, 767, 777 and 777X aircraft) as well as production of commercial derivative aircraft for our Defense, Space & Security business (KC-46A Tanker and P-8A Poseidon). Production for all programs resumed in December 2024 and gradually ramped up during the first quarter of 2025.

Table of Contents
Revenues
The following table summarizes Revenues:
Revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2025, increased by $2,927 million compared with the same period in 2024 driven by higher revenues at Commercial Airplanes (BCA) and Global Services (BGS), partially offset by lower revenues at Defense, Space & Security (BDS). BCA revenues increased by $3,494 million primarily due to higher deliveries and the absence of 737-9 customer considerations. BGS revenues increased by $18 million primarily due to higher government services revenue, partially offset by lower commercial services revenue. BDS revenues decreased by $652 million primarily driven by lower volume and the absence of a favorable MQ-25 contract modification that was awarded in the first quarter of 2024, partially offset by lower net unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments compared to the comparable period in the prior year.
Revenues will continue to be significantly impacted until deliveries ramp up, the global supply chain stabilizes, and labor instability diminishes.
Earnings/(loss) from Operations
The following table summarizes Earnings/(loss) from operations:
*    The FAS/CAS service cost adjustment represents the difference between the Financial Accounting Standards (FAS) pension and postretirement service costs calculated under GAAP and costs allocated to the business segments.
**    Core operating earnings/(loss) is a Non-GAAP measure that excludes the FAS/CAS service cost adjustment. See pages 47-48.
Earnings from operations for the three months ended March 31, 2025, was $461 million compared to loss from operations of $86 million during the same period in 2024. BCA loss from operations decreased by $606 million reflecting higher deliveries, the absence of 737-9 customer considerations and lower period expenses. BGS earnings from operations increased by $27 million primarily due to higher government

Table of Contents
services revenue. BDS earnings from operations increased by $4 million compared to the same period in 2024 primarily due to lower net unfavorable cumulative contract catch-up adjustments, largely offset by lower earnings from equity method investments and lower volume. Loss from operations on Unallocated items, eliminations and other increased by $50 million compared with the same period in 2024 primarily due to an increase in eliminations and other unallocated items expense.
Core operating earnings for the three months ended March 31, 2025, increased by $587 million compared with the same period in 2024, primarily due to an increase in Segment operating earnings as described above.
For information related to Postretirement Plans, see Note 12 to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.
Unallocated Items, Eliminations and Other
The most significant items included in Unallocated items, eliminations and other (expense)/income are shown in the following table:
Share-based plans expense increased by $40 million for the three months ended March 31, 2025 compared with the same period in 2024 primarily due to the timing of corporate allocations.
Deferred compensation expense decreased by $35 million for the three months ended March 31, 2025, compared with the same period in 2024 primarily driven by changes in broad stock market conditions.
Research and development expense was largely unchanged during the three months ended March 31, 2025, compared with the same period in 2024.
Eliminations and other unallocated items expense for the three months ended March 31, 2025, increased by $54 million compared with the same period in 2024 primarily due to the timing of allocations.
Other Earnings Items
36
Table of Contents
Other income, net for the three months ended March 31, 2025, increased by $46 million compared with the same period in 2024, primarily due to an increase in interest income on short-term investments and dividend income, partially offset by non-operating pension income. For information on changes related to non-operating pension and postretirement expenses, see Note 12 to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.
Interest and debt expense for the three months ended March 31, 2025, increased by $139 million compared with the same period in the prior year primarily as a result of higher average debt balances.
For a discussion related to Income Taxes, see Note 4 to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.
Total Costs and Expenses (“Cost of Sales”)
Cost of sales, for both products and services, consists primarily of raw materials, parts, sub-assemblies, labor, overhead and subcontracting costs. Our BCA segment predominantly uses program accounting to account for cost of sales. Under program accounting, cost of sales for each commercial aircraft program equals the product of (i) revenue recognized in connection with customer deliveries and (ii) the estimated cost of sales percentage applicable to the total remaining program. For long-term contracts, the amount reported as cost of sales is recognized as incurred. Substantially all contracts at our BDS segment and certain contracts at our BGS segment are long-term contracts with the U.S. government and other customers that generally extend over several years. Cost of sales for commercial spare parts is recorded at average cost.
The following table summarizes cost of sales:
Cost of sales for the three months ended March 31, 2025, increased by $2,386 million, or 16%, compared with the same period in 2024, primarily due to higher revenues at BCA, partially offset by lower volume and the absence of fixed-price development program charges at BDS. Cost of sales as a percentage of Revenues decreased during the three months ended March 31, 2025, compared with the same period in 2024, primarily due to the absence of 737-9 customer considerations at BCA and the absence of charges on BDS fixed-price development programs, partially offset by higher revenues at BCA.
Research and Development
Research and development expense, net is summarized in the following table:
Research and development expense was largely unchanged during the three months ended March 31, 2025, compared to the same period in 2024.

Backlog
Contractual backlog of unfilled orders excludes purchase options, announced orders for which definitive contracts have not been executed, orders where customers have the unilateral right to terminate, and unobligated U.S. and non-U.S. government contract funding. The increase in contractual backlog during the three months ended March 31, 2025, was primarily due to an increase in BCA and BGS backlog that was partially offset by a decrease in BDS backlog. We may experience reductions to backlog and/or significant order cancellations due to various factors including delivery delays, production disruptions and delays to entry into service of the 777X, 737-7 and/or 737-10.
Unobligated backlog includes U.S. and non-U.S. government definitive contracts for which funding has not been authorized. Unobligated backlog during the three months ended March 31, 2025 was largely unchanged.
Additional Considerations
U.S. Government Funding
Considerable uncertainty exists regarding how future U.S. government budget and program decisions will unfold, including the spending priorities of the new Administration and Congress.
The Full-Year Continuing Appropriations and Extensions Act, 2025, enacted on March 15, 2025, largely continues federal funding at fiscal year 2024 appropriated levels through September 30, 2025. This bill has been deemed to be a full-year appropriations bill in respect to satisfying the requirements of the Fiscal Responsibility Act, avoiding a sequester of defense and non-defense spending in fiscal year 2025 (FY25).
The U.S. government could experience a disruption to its operations and/or payments in 2025 if the debt limit is not addressed before the U.S. Treasury exhausts extraordinary measures. These potential disruptions, and any broader macroeconomic impacts, could affect our current programs and contracts and have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.
Global Trade
The global trade landscape is currently highly volatile. Various countries have announced plans for and/or have already implemented new or modified tariffs. For example, in the first quarter of 2025, the United States imposed modified tariffs on aluminum and steel imports, as well as additional tariffs on goods from China. In addition, the United States imposed tariffs on goods imported from Canada and Mexico that are not compliant with the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA). We believe that the majority of our imports from Canada and Mexico are compliant with the provisions of the USMCA. Our first quarter results reflect our best estimate of the impacts of the tariffs enacted as of March 31, 2025, and certain potential mitigations.
On April 2, 2025, the United States announced broad reciprocal tariffs on imports from all countries, comprising a 10% baseline tariff and higher country-specific tariffs. Other countries, including China, announced retaliatory actions or plans for retaliatory actions. On April 9, 2025, the United States implemented a 90-day pause on the country-specific reciprocal tariffs for all countries except China,

Table of Contents
leaving the 10% baseline tariff in place. These tariffs and any retaliatory actions from other countries could have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows. In April 2025, certain customers in China informed us that they will not accept deliveries. We continually monitor the global trade environment for new and/or changing tariffs, retaliatory actions, trade agreements, export restrictions, sanctions or other restrictions that may impact the Company or our supply chain or customers, and work to mitigate impacts to our business.
The current state of U.S.-China relations remains an ongoing watch item. China is a significant market for commercial aircraft and we have long-standing relationships with our Chinese customers. Overall, the U.S.-China trade relationship is challenged due to tariffs and other economic and national security concerns
.
We seek to comply with all U.S. and other government import requirements, export control restrictions and sanctions. We continue to monitor and evaluate additional sanctions and trade restrictions that may be imposed by the U.S. Government or other governments, as well as any responses that could affect our supply chain, business partners or customers, for any additional impacts to our business.
Supply Chain
We and our suppliers are experiencing inflationary pressures, as well as supply chain disruptions as a result of global supply chain constraints and labor instability. Our supply chain is also being impacted by the tariffs discussed above. Certain of our suppliers are also experiencing financial difficulties. We continue to monitor the health and stability of the supply chain. These factors have reduced overall productivity and adversely impacted our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. During 2024, we recorded a reach-forward loss of $1,770 million on the T-7A Red Hawk program that was primarily driven by projected increases in supplier cost estimates. In addition, we recorded losses on the KC-46A Tanker and Commercial Crew programs during 2024 that were partially attributable to higher supplier costs.

Results of Operations
Revenues
BCA revenues increased by $3,494 million for the three months ended March 31, 2025, compared with the same period in 2024 primarily due to higher deliveries and the absence of 737-9 customer considerations.
Commercial airplane deliveries, including intercompany deliveries, were as follows:
*
Intercompany deliveries identified by parentheses.
Loss From Operations
BCA loss from operations was $537 million for the three months ended March 31, 2025, compared with $1,143 million in the same period in 2024 reflecting higher deliveries, the absence of 737-9 customer considerations and lower period expenses.
Backlog
Our total backlog represents the estimated transaction prices on unsatisfied and partially satisfied performance obligations to our customers where we believe it is probable that we will collect the consideration due and where no contingencies remain before we and the customer are required to perform. Backlog does not include prospective orders where customer-controlled contingencies remain, such as the customer receiving approval from its board of directors, shareholders or government or completing financing arrangements. All such contingencies must be satisfied or have expired prior to recording a new firm order even if satisfying such conditions is highly probable. Backlog excludes options and customer financing orders as well as orders where customers have the unilateral right to terminate. A number of our customers may have contractual remedies, including rights to reject individual airplane deliveries if the actual delivery date is significantly later than the contractual delivery date. We address customer claims and requests for other contractual relief as they arise. The value of orders in backlog is adjusted as changes to price and schedule are agreed to with customers and is reported in accordance with the requirements of Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 606.
BCA total backlog increased from $435,175 million as of December 31, 2024, to $460,447 million at March 31, 2025, reflecting new orders in excess of deliveries and a decrease in the value of existing orders that, in our assessment, do not meet the accounting requirements of ASC 606 for inclusion in backlog and cancellations. Aircraft order cancellations during the three months ended March 31, 2025, totaled $2,312 million and primarily relate to 737 aircraft. Net ASC 606 adjustments during the three
40
Table of Contents
months ended March 31, 2025, totaled $6,017 million and primarily relate to 777X aircraft. ASC 606 adjustments include consideration of aircraft orders where a customer-controlled contingency may exist, as well as an assessment of whether the customer is committed to perform, impacts of geopolitical events or related sanctions, or whether it is probable that the customer will pay the full amount of consideration when it is due. We may experience reductions to backlog and/or significant order cancellations due to various factors including delivery delays, production disruptions and delays to entry into service of the 777X, 737-7 and/or 737-10.
Accounting Quantity
The following table provides details of the accounting quantities and firm orders by program. Cumulative firm orders represent the cumulative number of commercial jet aircraft deliveries plus undelivered firm orders. Firm orders include certain military derivative aircraft that are not included in program accounting quantities. All revenues and costs associated with military derivative aircraft production are reported in the BDS segment.
† Customer financing aircraft orders are identified in parentheses.
*
Approximate undelivered orders by minor model for March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024: 737-7 (7%), 737-8 (63%), 737-9 (5%) and 737-10 (25%).
Program Highlights
737 Program
In January 2024, a 737-9 flight made an emergency landing after a mid-exit door plug detached in flight. As a result of the accident, the FAA investigated the 737 quality control system, including Spirit AeroSystems Holdings, Inc. (Spirit), and increased its oversight of Boeing’s production and quality and safety management systems. The FAA also communicated it will not approve production rate increases beyond 38 per month or additional production lines until Boeing has complied with required quality and safety standards. In 2024, we submitted a comprehensive safety and quality plan to the FAA to address the issues identified in connection with the FAA's investigation. We also took additional actions to improve safety and quality, which include investing in workforce training, simplifying plans and processes, eliminating defects, and enhancing our safety and quality culture. In 2025, we are continuing to implement these improvements and align our production plans consistent with the comprehensive safety and quality plan.
We are gradually increasing to a production rate of 38 per month aligned with our safety and quality plan. As of March 31, 2025, we had approximately 35 737-8 aircraft in inventory that were produced prior to 2023, including approximately 25 aircraft for customers in China. We are scheduled to deliver these aircraft in 2025. It is currently unclear how the trade tensions between the U.S. and China will impact deliveries to China.

Table of Contents
We are continuing to work through the certification process of the 737-7 and 737-10 models, which have been delayed, while we work through the engineering solution for the engine anti-ice system. As of March 31, 2025, we had approximately 35 737-7 and 737-10 aircraft in inventory. We are following the lead of the FAA as we work through the certification process and the ultimate timing will be determined by the regulators.
If we are unable to deliver aircraft and/or increase future production rates, or certify the 737-7 and 737-10 models consistent with our assumptions, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows will be adversely affected.
See further discussion of the 737 MAX in Note 6 and Note 10 to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
.
767 Program
The 767 assembly line includes the commercial program and a derivative to support the KC-46A Tanker program. We are currently targeting a production rate of approximately 3 aircraft per month. We expect to complete production of the 767 commercial program by 2027. This program has break-even gross margins.
See further discussion of the KC-46A Tanker program in Note 10 to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.
777 and 777X Programs
The accounting quantity for the 777 program extends through year-end 2027. We increased the accounting quantity by 3 units during the three months ended March 31, 2025, because we now expect to produce an additional 3 units in that timeframe. We are currently targeting a combined production rate of 4 per month for the 777/777X programs.
In July 2024, we obtained approval from the FAA to begin the first phase of FAA certification flight testing. The first phase of flight testing was paused starting in August and resumed in January. We obtained approval from the FAA to begin the next phase of certification flight testing, and we began these activities in March 2025.
We continue to anticipate first delivery of the 777-9 to occur in 2026 and the 777-8 Freighter to occur in 2028. First delivery of the 777-8 passenger aircraft is not expected to occur before 2030. We are following the lead of the FAA as we work through the certification process and the ultimate timing will be determined by the regulators.
The 777X program had break-even gross margins at March 31, 2025. The level of profitability on the 777X program will be subject to several factors. These factors include aircraft certification requirements and timing, change incorporation on completed aircraft, production disruption due to labor instability and supply chain disruption, customer considerations, delivery timing and negotiations, further production rate adjustments for the 777X or other commercial aircraft programs, and any change in the accounting quantity. One or more of these factors could result in reach-forward losses in future periods.
787 Program
We are currently at a production rate of approximately 5 aircraft per month. We are continuing to monitor supply chain health and factory performance as we work to increase production rates. As of March 31, 2025, we had approximately 20 aircraft in inventory, including 4 aircraft for customers in China, that were produced prior to 2023 and required rework. In February 2025, we completed the rework of the last aircraft and expect to deliver the majority of these aircraft in 2025. It is currently unclear how trade tensions between the U.S. and China will impact deliveries to China.
Additional Considerations
On June 30, 2024, we entered into an agreement to acquire Spirit. See Note 2 to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

Defense, Space & Security
Overview
The Full-Year Continuing Appropriations and Extensions Act, 2025, enacted on March 15, 2025, provided FY25 appropriations for government departments and agencies, including $856 billion for the U.S. Department of Defense (U.S. DoD) and $25 billion for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). This bill has been deemed to be a full-year appropriations bill in respect to satisfying the requirements of the Fiscal Responsibility Act, avoiding a sequester of defense and non-defense spending in FY25.
There is ongoing uncertainty with respect to program-level spending for the U.S. DoD, NASA and other government agencies for FY25 and beyond. Future budget cuts or investment priority changes, including changes associated with the authorizations and appropriations process, could result in reductions, cancellations and/or delays of existing contracts or programs. Any of these impacts could have a material effect on our results of operations, financing position, and/or cash flows.
The non-U.S. market continues to be driven by complex and evolving security challenges and the need to modernize aging equipment and inventories. BDS expects that it will continue to have a wide range of opportunities across Asia, Europe and the Middle East given the diverse regional threats. At March 31, 2025, 29% of BDS backlog was attributable to non-U.S. customers.
Results of Operations
Since our operating cycle is long-term and involves many different types of development and production contracts with varying delivery and milestone schedules, the operating results of a particular period may not be indicative of future operating results. In addition, depending on the customer and their funding sources, our orders might be structured as annual follow-on contracts, or as one large multi-year order or long-term award. As a result, period-to-period comparisons of backlog are not necessarily indicative of future workloads. The following discussions of comparative results among periods should be viewed in this context.
Deliveries of new-build production units, including remanufactures and modifications, were as follows:

Table of Contents
Revenues
BDS revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2025, decreased by $652 million compared with the same period in 2024. The decrease is primarily due to lower volume on P-8, KC-46 Tanker, ground-based missile defense, proprietary, and E-7 programs, as well as the absence of a favorable MQ-25 contract modification that was awarded during the first quarter of 2024. The decrease in revenue was partially offset by $70 million lower net unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments compared to the prior year comparable period.
Earnings From Operations
BDS earnings from operations for the three months ended March 31, 2025, was $155 million, compared with $151 million in the same period in 2024. The increase in earnings is primarily due to lower net unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments of $213 million compared to the comparable period in the prior year. The lower net unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments were largely offset by lower earnings from equity method investments and lower volume and mix on P-8, F-15, E-7, and ground-based missile defense programs. During the three months ended March 31, 2025, losses incurred on the five major fixed-price development programs totaled $0 million compared to $222 million in the same period in 2024.
See further discussion of fixed-price contracts in Note 10 to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.
BDS earnings from operations includes our share of earnings from equity method investments of $6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2025, compared with $75 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024.
Backlog
BDS backlog of $61,567 million at March 31, 2025 compared with $64,023 million as of December 31, 2024, reflects revenue recognized on contracts awarded in prior periods and the timing of awards. In March 2025, the U.S. Air Force announced that Boeing has been awarded a contract to design, build and deliver the F-47, its next-generation fighter aircraft. This order is not included in backlog at March 31, 2025, pending completion of the source selection and evaluation review process.
Additional Considerations
Our BDS business includes a variety of development programs which have complex design and technical challenges. Some of these programs have cost-type contracting arrangements. In these cases, the associated financial risks are primarily reduced award or incentive fees, lower profit rates or program cancellation if cost, schedule or technical performance issues arise. Examples of these programs include Ground-based Midcourse Defense, Proprietary and Space Launch System programs.
Some of our development programs are contracted on a fixed-price basis. Examples of significant fixed-price development programs include Commercial Crew, KC-46A Tanker, MQ-25, T-7A Red Hawk, VC-25B, and commercial and military satellites. A number of our ongoing fixed-price development programs have reach-forward losses. New programs could also have risk for reach-forward loss upon contract award and during the period of contract performance. Many development programs have highly complex designs. As technical or quality issues arise during development, we may experience schedule delays and cost impacts, which could increase our estimated cost to perform the work or reduce our estimated price, either of which could result in a material charge or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition. These programs are ongoing, and while we believe the cost and fee estimates incorporated in the financial statements are appropriate, the technical complexity of these programs creates financial risk as additional completion costs may become necessary or scheduled delivery dates could be extended, which could trigger termination provisions or other financially significant exposure. Risk remains that we may be required to record additional reach-forward losses in future periods.

Results of Operations
Revenues
BGS revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2025 increased by $18 million compared with the same period in 2024, primarily due to higher government services revenue, partially offset by lower commercial services revenue. The net unfavorable impact of cumulative contract catch-up adjustments for the three months ended March 31, 2025 was $8 million lower than the prior year comparable period.
Earnings From Operations
BGS earnings from operations for the three months ended March 31, 2025 increased by $27 million compared with the same period in 2024, primarily due to higher government services revenue. The net unfavorable impact of cumulative contract catch-up adjustments for the three months ended March 31, 2025 was $2 million lower than the prior year comparable period.
Backlog
BGS total backlog increased from $21,403 million at December 31, 2024 to $22,036 million at March 31, 2025, primarily due to the timing of awards, partially offset by revenue recognized on contracts awarded in prior years.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Cash Flow Summary
Operating Activities
Net cash used by operating activities was $1.6 billion during the three months ended March 31, 2025, compared with $3.4 billion during the same period in 2024. The $1.8 billion decrease in net cash used by operating activities was primarily driven by higher commercial airplane deliveries, lower customer considerations and working capital improvements.
45
Table of Contents
Changes in assets and liabilities during the three months ended March 31, 2025, improved by $1.5 billion compared with the same period in 2024, primarily driven by favorable changes in Inventories ($2.3 billion), Unbilled receivables ($0.7 billion) and Accrued liabilities ($0.3 billion), partially offset by changes in Advances and progress billings ($1.9 billion). The change in Inventories was primarily driven by higher deliveries on our commercial airplane programs during the three months ended March 31, 2025 as compared to the same period in 2024. The change in Unbilled receivables during the three months ended March 31, 2025 was primarily driven by a decrease in revenue recognized in excess of billings at BDS compared to the same period in 2024. Changes in Accrued liabilities during the three months ended March 31, 2025 was $0.4 billion compared to $0.7 billion during the same period in 2024. Concessions paid to 737 MAX customers totaled $38 million and $553 million for the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024. Changes in Advances and progress billings during three months ended March 31, 2025 was $0.8 billion compared to $2.7 billion during the same period in 2024 primarily driven by increased commercial airplane deliveries and lower advances on commercial airplane orders.
Payables to suppliers who elected to participate in supply chain financing programs decreased by $0.6 billion and $0.4 billion during the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024. Supply chain financing is not material to our overall liquidity.
Investing Activities
Net cash used by investing activities during the three months ended March 31, 2025, was $1.7 billion, compared with net cash provided by investing activities of $2.1 billion during the same period in 2024. The increase in cash used was primarily due to net contributions to investments of $1.0 billion in 2025 compared with net proceeds from investments of $2.7 billion in 2024. During the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, capital expenditures were $0.7 billion and $0.6 billion. We continue to expect capital expenditures in 2025 to be higher than in 2024.
Financing Activities
Net cash used
by financing activities was $0.3 billion during the three months ended March 31, 2025, compared with $4.5 billion during the same period in 2024. During the three months ended March 31, 2025, net repayments were $0.3 billion compared with $4.4 billion during the same period in 2024.
As of March 31, 2025, the total debt balance was $53.6 billion, down from $53.9 billion at December 31, 2024. At March 31, 2025, $7.9 billion of debt was classified as short-term.
Capital Resources
On June 30, 2024, we entered into an agreement to acquire Spirit in an all-stock transaction at an equity value of approximately $4.7 billion, or $37.25 per share of Spirit Class A Common Stock. The transaction will include the assumption of Spirit's net debt at closing. See Note 2 to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.
At March 31, 2025, we had $10.1 billion of cash, $13.5 billion of short-term investments, and $10.0 billion of unused borrowing capacity on revolving credit line agreements. Our $3.0 billion three-year revolving credit agreement expiring in August 2025, $3.0 billion five-year revolving credit agreement expiring in August 2028, and $4.0 billion five-year revolving credit agreement expiring in May 2029 remain in effect. We anticipate that these credit lines will primarily serve as back-up liquidity to support our general corporate borrowing needs. At March 31, 2025 we were in full compliance with all covenants contained in our debt and credit facility agreements.
We currently maintain investment grade credit ratings across all three credit rating agencies. At Moody's we are rated Baa3 with a negative outlook. At Fitch, we are rated BBB- with a negative outlook. At S&P, we are rated BBB- with a credit watch negative.
We expect to be able to access capital markets when we require additional funding to support our operations, pay off existing debt, address impacts to our business related to market developments, fund outstanding financing commitments or meet other business requirements; however, a number of factors could increase the cost of borrowing, jeopardize our ability to incur debt on terms acceptable to us, and negatively impact our access to the capital and financial markets and our ability to fund our operations

Table of Contents
and commitments. These factors include further downgrades in our credit ratings, disruptions or declines in the global capital markets, a decline in our financial performance or outlook, a delay in our ability to ramp up production and deliveries, and changes in demand for our products and services. The occurrence of any or all of these events may adversely affect our ability to fund our operations and financing or contractual commitments. See “Risks Related to Financing and Liquidity” under “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of our 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Any future borrowings may affect our credit ratings and are subject to various debt covenants. The most restrictive covenants include a limitation on mortgage debt and sale and leaseback transactions as a percentage of consolidated net tangible assets (as defined in the credit agreements), and a limitation on consolidated debt as a percentage of total capital (as defined in the credit agreements). When considering debt covenants, we continue to have substantial borrowing capacity.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We are a party to certain off-balance sheet arrangements including certain guarantees. For discussion of these arrangements, see Note 11 to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.
Contingent Obligations
We have significant contingent obligations that arise in the ordinary course of business, which include the following:
Legal
Various legal proceedings, claims and investigations are pending against us. Legal contingencies are discussed in Note 17 to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.
Environmental Remediation
We are involved with various environmental remediation activities and have recorded a liability of $855 million at March 31, 2025. For additional information, see Note 10 to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.
Non-GAAP Measures
Core Operating Earnings/(Loss), Core Operating Margins and Core Earnings/(Loss) Per Share
Our unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (GAAP) which we supplement with certain non-GAAP financial information. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related GAAP measures, and other companies may define such measures differently. We encourage investors to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure. Core operating earnings/(loss), Core operating margins and Core earnings/(loss) per share exclude the FAS/CAS service cost adjustment. The FAS/CAS service cost adjustment represents the difference between the Financial Accounting Standards (FAS) pension and postretirement service costs calculated under GAAP and costs allocated to the business segments. Core earnings/(loss) per share excludes both the FAS/CAS service cost adjustment and non-operating pension and postretirement income. Non-operating pension and postretirement income represents the components of net periodic benefit costs other than service cost. Pension costs, comprising service and prior service costs computed in accordance with GAAP are allocated to BCA and certain BGS businesses supporting commercial customers. Pension costs allocated to BDS and BGS businesses supporting government customers are computed in accordance with U.S. Government Cost Accounting Standards (CAS), which employ different actuarial assumptions and accounting conventions than GAAP. CAS costs are allocable to government contracts. Other postretirement benefit costs are allocated to all business segments based on CAS, which is generally based on benefits paid.
The Pension FAS/CAS service cost adjustments recognized in Earnings/(loss) from operations were benefits of
$193 million
and
$230 million
for the
three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024
. The lower benefits in 2025 were primarily due to reductions in allocated pension cost year over year. The non-operating pension income included in Other income, net was
$43 million
and
$123 million
for the
three

Table of Contents
months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024
.
The lower benefits in 2025 were primarily due to lower expected return on plan assets. For further discussion of pension and other postretirement costs see "Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" on page 28 of our 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Management uses Core operating earnings/(loss), Core operating margins and Core earnings/(loss) per share for purposes of evaluating and forecasting underlying business performance. Management believes these core earnings measures provide investors additional insights into operational performance as unallocated pension and other postretirement benefit costs primarily represent costs driven by market factors and costs not allocable to U.S. government contracts.
Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures to GAAP Measures
The table below reconciles the non-GAAP financial measures of Core operating earnings/(loss), Core operating margins and Core loss per share with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures of Earnings/(loss) from operations, Operating margins and Diluted loss per share.
(1)
FAS/CAS service cost adjustment represents the difference between the FAS pension and postretirement service costs calculated under GAAP and costs allocated to the business segments. This adjustment is excluded from Core operating earnings/(loss) (non-GAAP).
(2)
Non-operating pension and postretirement income represents the components of net periodic benefit costs/(income) other than service cost/(income). This income is included in Other income, net and is excluded from Core operating earnings/(loss) (non-GAAP).
(3)
The income tax impact is calculated using the U.S. corporate statutory tax rate.

Item 1A. Risk Factors
The following risks update the risk factors set forth in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024. Please refer to Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024, for other risks related to our business.
We derive a significant portion of our revenues from non-U.S. sales and are subject to risks of doing business in other countries, including those related to tariffs, trade restrictions and government actions.
In 2024, non-U.S. customers, which include foreign military sales, accounted for approximately 46% of our total revenues and approximately 70% of Commercial Airplanes revenue from customer contracts. We expect non-U.S. sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues for the foreseeable future. We are subject to risks of doing business internationally, including:
•
changes in regulatory requirements or other executive branch actions, such as Executive Orders;
•
changes in the global trade environment, including potential deterioration in geopolitical or trade relations between countries;
•
disputes with authorities in non-U.S. jurisdictions, including international trade authorities;
•
imposition of domestic and international taxes, export controls, tariffs, duties, embargoes, sanctions and other trade restrictions;
•
tariffs, duties or other costs attributable to the importation of raw materials, parts, products and services, which could impact sales and/or delivery of products and services outside the U.S. and/or impose increased costs on us, our supply chain or our customers;
•
changes to U.S. and non-U.S. government policies, including sourcing restrictions, requirements to expend a portion of program funds locally and governmental industrial cooperation or participation requirements;
•
fluctuations in international currency exchange rates;
•
volatility in international political and economic environments and changes in non-U.S. national priorities and budgets, which can lead to delays or fluctuations in orders;
•
the complexity and necessity of using non-U.S. representatives and consultants;
•
the uncertainty of the ability of non-U.S. customers to finance purchases, including the availability of financing from the Export-Import Bank of the United States;
•
uncertainties and restrictions concerning the availability of funding credit or guarantees;
•
the difficulty of management and operation of an enterprise spread over many countries;
•
compliance with a variety of non-U.S. laws, as well as U.S. laws affecting the activities of U.S. companies abroad; and unforeseen developments and conditions, including terrorism, war, epidemics and international tensions and conflicts.
While the impact of these factors is difficult to predict, any one or more of these factors could adversely affect our operations.

The United States recently announced changes to U.S. trade policy, including adding new or modifying existing tariffs on imports, in some cases significantly. For example, on April 2, 2025, the United States announced a 10% baseline reciprocal tariff on imports from all countries, plus an additional country-specific tariff on imports from select trading partners. Other countries have announced retaliatory actions or plans for retaliatory actions.
On April 9, 2025, the United States implemented a 90-day pause on the country-specific tariffs for all countries except China, while maintaining the 10% baseline tariff.
Tariffs and any retaliatory actions could significantly increase the cost of our products and, particularly with respect to our commercial aircraft, result in lower demand for our products, delivery delays, and terminations of orders by customers.
China is a significant market for commercial aircraft and we have long-standing relationships with our Chinese customers. Overall, the U.S.-China trade relationship is challenged due to tariffs and other economic and national security concerns
.
In April 2025, certain customers in China informed us that they will not accept deliveries. If we are unable to deliver aircraft to customers in China consistent with our assumptions and/or obtain additional orders from China in the future, we may experience reduced deliveries and/or lower market share.
Impacts from potential deterioration in geopolitical or trade relationships between the U.S. and other countries, particularly China and European Union members states, including as a result of the risks described above, could have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.
