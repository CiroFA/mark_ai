NOTE 2.
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of presentation
The accompanying unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“U.S. GAAP”) and include the accounts of the Company, its wholly-owned subsidiaries and consolidated Variable Interest Entities (“VIEs”). These unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements are stated in U.S. dollars, except for where otherwise indicated. Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated for consolidation purposes.
Substantially all net revenues and financial income, cost of net revenues and financial expenses and operating expenses, are generated in the Company’s foreign operations. Long-lived assets, intangible assets and goodwill and operating lease right-of-use assets located in the foreign jurisdictions totaled $
3,013
million and $
2,632
million as of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively.
These unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements reflect the Company’s consolidated financial position as of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024. These unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements include the Company’s consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, equity and cash flows for the three-month periods ended March 31, 2025 and 2024. These unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements include all normal recurring adjustments that Management believes are necessary to fairly state the Company’s financial position, operating results and cash flows.
Because all of the disclosures required by U.S. GAAP for annual consolidated financial statements are not included herein, these unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto for the year ended December 31, 2024, contained in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) (the “Company’s 2024 10-K”). The Company has evaluated all subsequent events through the date these unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements were issued. The interim condensed consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, equity and cash flows for the periods presented herein are not necessarily indicative of results expected for any future period. For a more detailed discussion of the Company’s significant accounting policies, see Note 2 to the financial statements in the Company’s 2024 10-K. During the three-month period ended March 31, 2025, there were no material updates made to the Company’s significant accounting policies.
Use of estimates
The preparation of these unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires Management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Estimates are used for, but not limited to, accounting and disclosures for allowance for doubtful accounts and chargeback provisions, inventories valuation reserves, recoverability of goodwill, intangible assets with indefinite useful lives and deferred tax assets, impairment of cash and cash equivalents, short-term and long-term investments, impairment of long-lived assets, separation of lease and non lease components for aircraft leases, asset retirement obligation, compensation costs relating to the Company’s long term retention program, fair value of certain loans payable and other financial liabilities, fair value of loans receivable, fair value of derivative instruments, income taxes, contingencies and determination of the incremental borrowing rate at commencement date of lease operating agreements. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Supplier finance programs
The Company and certain financial institutions participate in a supplier finance program that enables certain of the Company’s suppliers, at their own election, to request the payment of their invoices to the financial institutions earlier than the terms stated in the Company’s payment policy.
As of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, the obligations outstanding that the Company has confirmed as valid to the financial institutions amounted to $
444
million and $
425
million, respectively.
For further information related to Supplier Finance Programs please refer to Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements in the Company’s 2024 10-K.
Revenue recognition
Revenue recognition criteria for the services provided and goods sold by the Company are described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in the Company’s 2024 10-K.
The aggregate gain included in “Financial services and income” revenues arising from financing transactions and sales of financial assets, net of the costs recognized on sale of credit card receivables, is $
506
million and $
365
million for the three-month periods ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively.
Revenues recognized under ASC 606, Revenue from contracts with customers, amounted to $
4,191
million and $
3,099
million for the three-month periods ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively. Revenues not recognized under ASC 606 amounted to $
1,744
million and $
1,234
million for the three-month periods ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively.
Contract balances
Timing of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing to customers. Receivables represent amounts invoiced and revenue recognized prior to invoicing when the Company has satisfied the performance obligation and has the unconditional right to payment. Accounts receivable and credit card receivables and other means of payments are presented net of allowance for doubtful accounts and chargebacks of $
45
million and $
42
million as of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively. See Note 5 – Loans receivable, Net of these unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements for information related to the allowance for doubtful accounts with respect to the Company’s loans receivable.
Contract liabilities from contracts with customers consists of fees received related to unsatisfied performance obligations at the end of the period in accordance with ASC 606. Due to the generally short-term duration of contracts, the majority of the performance obligations are satisfied in the following months.
Contract liabilities from contracts with customers as of December 31, 2024 was $
77
million, of which $
73
million was recognized as revenue during the three-month period ended March 31, 2025.
As of March 31, 2025, total contract liabilities from contracts with customers recognized within current other liabilities was $
83
million, mainly due to fees related to classified advertising services billed, subscriptions and loyalty programs, shipping services and inventory sales that are expected to be recognized as revenue in the coming months.
Foreign currency translation
All of the Company’s foreign operations have determined the local currency to be their functional currency, except for Argentina, which has used the U.S. dollar as its functional currency since July 1, 2018. Accordingly, the foreign subsidiaries with local currency as functional currency translate assets and liabilities from their local currencies into U.S. dollars by using period-end exchange rates while income and expense accounts are translated at the average monthly rates in effect during the period, unless exchange rates fluctuate significantly during the period, in which case the exchange rates at the date of the transaction are used. The resulting translation adjustment is recorded as a component of other comprehensive income (loss). Gains and losses resulting from transactions denominated in non-functional currencies are recognized in earnings. Net foreign currency transaction results are included in the interim condensed consolidated statements of income under the caption “Foreign currency losses, net.”
Argentine currency status and macroeconomic outlook
As of July 1, 2018, the Company transitioned its Argentine operations to highly inflationary status in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and changed the functional currency for Argentine subsidiaries from Argentine Pesos to U.S. dollars, which is the functional currency of their immediate parent company. Argentina’s inflation rate for the three-month periods ended March 31, 2025 and 2024 was
8.6
% and
51.6
%, respectively. Additionally, Argentina’s average inter-annual inflation rate for the three-month period ended March 31, 2025 was 69.1%.
The Company uses Argentina’s official exchange rate to account for transactions in the Argentine segment, which as of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024 was
1,074.00
and
1,032.00
Argentine Pesos, respectively, against the U.S. dollar. For the three-month periods ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, Argentina’s official exchange rate against the U.S. dollar increased
4.1
% and
6.1
%, respectively. The average exchange rate for the three-month periods ended March 31, 2025 and 2024 was
1,057.00
and
834.46
, respectively, resulting in an increase of
26.7
%.

Argentine exchange regulations
In the second half of 2019, the Argentine government instituted exchange controls restricting the ability of companies and individuals to exchange Argentine Pesos for foreign currencies and their ability to remit foreign currency out of Argentina. An entity’s authorization request to the Central Bank of Argentina (“CBA”) to access the official exchange market to make foreign currency payments may be denied depending on the circumstances. As a result of these exchange controls, markets in Argentina developed trading mechanisms, in which an entity or individual buys U.S. dollar denominated securities in Argentina (i.e. shares, sovereign debt) using Argentine Pesos, and subsequently sells the securities for U.S. dollars, in Argentina, to access U.S. dollars locally, or outside Argentina, by transferring the securities abroad, prior to being sold (the latter commonly known as “Blue Chip Swap Rate”). The Blue Chip Swap Rate diverged from Argentina’s official exchange rate (commonly known as the exchange spread). As of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, the exchange spread was
22.9
% and
14.7
%, respectively.
On April 11, 2025, the Argentine government announced a series of measures aimed at easing regulations related to access to the foreign exchange market. Among other modifications, these measures include the establishment of floating bands (between 1,000 and 1,400 Argentine Pesos) within which the dollar exchange rate in the foreign exchange market may fluctuate, the elimination of foreign exchange restrictions applicable to individuals, the ability of companies to transfer dividends abroad to non-resident shareholders related to fiscal years beginning on or after January 1, 2025 and provide greater flexibility to make payments abroad for imports of goods and services. As a result of the liberalization of the exchange controls, the Blue Chip Swap Rate in Argentina has substantially converged with the official exchange rate.
Income taxes
Income taxes’ accounting policy is described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in the Company’s 2024 10-K.
The Company’s consolidated estimated effective tax rate for the three-month period ended March 31, 2025, as compared to the same period in 2024, increased from
28.5
% to
30.0
%, mainly as a result of lower deductions related to tax inflation adjustments in Argentina, partially offset by lower taxable foreign exchange gains accounted for in Argentina for local tax purposes that are not recorded for accounting purposes since, under U.S. GAAP, the Argentine operations’ functional currency is the U.S. dollar due to the highly inflationary status of the country.
A valuation allowance is recorded when, based on the available evidence, it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the Company’s deferred tax assets will not be realized. In accordance with ASC 740, Management periodically assesses the need to either establish or reverse a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets considering positive and negative objective evidence related to the realization of the deferred tax assets. In its assessment, Management considers, among other factors, the nature, frequency and magnitude of current and cumulative losses on an individual subsidiary basis, projections of future taxable income, the duration of statutory carryforward periods, as well as feasible tax planning strategies, which would be employed by the Company to prevent tax loss carry-forwards from expiring unutilized.
Knowledge-based economy promotional regime in Argentina
In August 2021, the Under Secretariat of Knowledge Economy issued the Disposition 316/2021 approving MercadoLibre S.R.L.’s application for eligibility under the knowledge-based economy promotional regime, established by the Law No. 27,506 and complemented by Argentina’s Executive Power Decree No. 1034/2020, Argentina’s Ministry of Productive Development’s Resolution No. 4/2021 and the Under Secretariat of Knowledge Economy’s Disposition No. 11/2021. On September 13, 2024, Argentina’s Secretariat of Entrepreneurs and Small and Medium Enterprises and Knowledge-Based Economy issued Resolution 267/2024, reducing the aggregate cap on base salaries used to calculate the tax credit bond to which companies that qualify for the regime are entitled from approximately 40 million Argentine pesos to 5 million Argentine pesos; the tax credit bond represents
70
% of the Company’s social security contributions for those employees whose jobs are related to the promoted activities, with a salary cap which has been reduced to the indicated limit. MercadoLibre S.R.L. uses the tax credit bond to offset federal taxes.
As a result, the Company recorded an income tax benefit of $
18
million and $
1
million during the three-month periods ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively. The aggregate per share effect of the income tax benefit amounted to $
0.36
and $
0.01
for the three-month periods ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively. Furthermore, the Company recorded a social security benefit of $
17
million during the three-month period ended March 31, 2024. For the three-month period ended March 31, 2025, the Company has not recorded any social security benefit.
Fair value option applied to certain financial instruments
Under ASC 825, U.S. GAAP provides an option to elect fair value with impact on the statement of income as an alternative measurement for certain financial instruments and other items on the balance sheet.
The Company has elected to measure certain financial assets at fair value with impact on the statement of income for several reasons including to avoid the mismatch generated by the recognition of certain linked instruments / transactions, separately, in the interim condensed consolidated statements of income and interim condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income and to better reflect the financial model applied for selected instruments. The Company’s election of the fair value option applies to: i) foreign government debt securities and ii) U.S. government debt securities.
Additionally, the Company has elected to measure the liability related to the Meli Dólar program, which corresponds to the holding by third-parties of the Company’s stablecoin, at fair value.

On November 4, 2024, the FASB issued the ASU 2024-03 “Income Statement—Reporting Comprehensive Income—Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses.” The amendments in this update improve financial reporting by requiring disclosure of additional information about certain costs and expenses in the notes to financial statements at interim and annual reporting, such as the amounts of purchases of inventory, employee compensation, depreciation and intangible asset amortization included in each relevant expense caption; a qualitative description of the amounts remaining in relevant expense captions that are not separately disaggregated quantitatively; the total amount of selling expenses and, in annual reporting periods, an entity’s definition of selling expenses. The amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim reporting periods within annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2027 (as clarified by ASU 2025-01).

LOANS RECEIVABLE, NET
The Company classifies loans receivable as “Merchant,” “Consumer,” “Credit cards” and “Asset-backed.” As of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, the components of current and non-current Loans receivable, net were as follows:
The allowance for doubtful accounts with respect to the Company’s loans receivable amounts to $

million as of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively, which includes $
20
million and $
30
million related to unused agreed loan commitment on credit cards portfolio presented in Other liabilities of the interim condensed consolidated balance sheets as of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively.
As of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, the Company is exposed to off-balance sheet unused agreed loan commitment on credit cards portfolio which expose the Company to credit risks for $

From time to time, the Company sells loans receivable related to its lending solution. In this regard, during 2024, the Company signed a contract with a third party to sell an amount up to $
100
million of its loans receivable, as part of its funding strategy. These loans were originated by its Mexican subsidiary and provided to local users. This transaction is accounted for as a true sale and the Company has a continuing involvement related to a servicing fee charged to the purchaser for collection services and regarding a beneficial interest retained by the Company over the transferred assets. Such involvements do not preclude the fact that this operation qualifies as a true sale because the purchaser has full control over the transferred assets.

31
million of loans receivable and recorded a gain of $
1
million related to the aforementioned contract. As of December 31, 2024, the Company sold $

The Company writes off loans when customer balance becomes 360 days past due.
The Company closely monitors credit quality for all loans receivable on a recurring basis to assess and manage its exposure to credit risk. To assess merchants and consumers seeking a loan under the lending solution, the Company uses, among other indicators, risk models internally developed, as a credit quality indicator to help predict the merchant’s and consumer’s ability to repay the principal balance and interest related to the credit. The risk model uses multiple variables as predictors of the merchant’s and consumer’s ability to repay the credit, including external and internal indicators. Internal indicators consider user behavior related to credit/payment history, and with lower weight in the risk models, the Company uses number of transactions in the Company’s ecosystem and merchant’s annual sales volume, among other indicators. In addition, the Company considers external bureau information to enhance the model and the decision making process.
The amortized cost of the loans receivable classified by the Company’s credit quality internal indicator was as follows:
As of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, renegotiations represented
1.3
% and
1.4
% of the loans receivable portfolio, respectively.

SEGMENTS
The Company manages the business country-by-country to understand and focus on the specific needs and opportunities in those markets. The Company’s chief executive officer is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance and is therefore its chief operating decision maker (“CODM”). The Company’s segments include Brazil, Mexico, Argentina and other countries (which includes Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Peru, Uruguay and the U.S.).
The CODM makes decisions considering all business lines within a country as whole, taking into account the synergies between the different lines in each of the countries’ integrated digital ecosystems.
The CODM evaluates the performance of the Company’s operating segments based on their direct contribution.
Direct contribution consists of net revenues and financial income from external customers less segment costs, which include expenses, such as shipping operation costs (including warehousing costs), carrier and other operating costs, provision for doubtful accounts, cost of goods sold, collection fees, funding cost, salaries and wages, marketing expenses and hosting expenses. All corporate related costs have been excluded from the segment’s direct contribution.

Notes to unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements
The Company’s assets and liabilities measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis were valued using i) Level 1 inputs: unadjusted quoted prices in active markets (Level 1 instrument valuations are obtained from observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets in active markets); ii) Level 2 inputs: obtained from readily-available pricing sources for comparable instruments as well as instruments with inactive markets at the measurement date; and iii) Level 3 inputs: valuations based on unobservable inputs reflecting Company’s assumptions. The unobservable inputs of the fair value of contingent considerations classified as Level 3 refer to the amounts to be paid according to the agreement of an acquisition, the likelihood of achievement of the targets included in that arrangement (expected to be 100%), and the Company’s historical experience with similar arrangements. Reasonable variation on those unobservable inputs would not significantly change the fair value of those instruments. As of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, the Company had not changed the methodology nor the assumptions used to estimate the fair value of the financial instruments.
There were no transfers to and from Levels 1, 2 and 3 during the three-month period ended March 31, 2025, nor during the year ended December 31, 2024.
The Company’s election of the fair value option applies to: i) foreign government debt securities, ii) U.S. government debt securities and iii) Meli Dólar liability. The Company recognized fair value changes of foreign and U.S. government debt securities, which include the related interest income of those instruments, in net service revenues and financial income if it is related to Mercado Pago’s operations or in interest income and other financial gains if not. Such fair value changes and interest income amount to gains of $
125
million and $
69
million in net service revenues and financial income, and $
20
million and $
10
million in interest income and other financial gains for the three-month periods ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively. The Meli Dólar liability has not presented changes in its fair value for the three-month period ended March 31, 2025. No Meli Dólar liability existed during the three-month period ended March 31, 2024.
As of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, the cost of the Company’s investment in corporate debt securities classified as available for sale amounted to $
261
million and $
259
million, respectively, and the estimated fair value amounted to $
265
million and $
262
million, respectively. The cost of these securities is determined under a specific identification basis. As of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024 the gross unrealized gains accumulated amounted to $
4
million and $
3
million, respectively.  For the three-month periods ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, the proceeds from sales of corporate debt securities amounted to $
24
million and $
3
million, respectively.
The following table summarizes the net carrying amount of the corporate debt securities classified as available for sale, classified by its contractual maturities:

Financial assets and liabilities not measured and recorded at fair value
The following table summarizes the estimated fair value of the financial assets and liabilities of the Company not measured at fair value as of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024:
As of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, the carrying value of the Company’s financial assets with determinable fair value (except for loans receivable) not measured at fair value approximated their fair value mainly because of their short-term maturity or because the effective interest rates are not materially different from market interest rates. If these financial assets were measured at fair value in the financial statements, cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash and cash equivalents would be classified as Level 1 (where cost and fair value are aligned) and the remaining financial assets would be classified as Level 2. The estimated fair value of the loans receivable would be classified as Level 3 based on the Company’s assumptions.
As of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, the carrying value of the Company’s financial liabilities (except for the
2.375
% Sustainability Notes due 2026 (the “2026 Sustainability Notes”) and the
3.125
% Notes due 2031 (the “2031 Notes”)) not measured at fair value approximated their fair value mainly because of their short-term maturity or because the effective interest rates are not materially different from market interest rates. If these financial liabilities were measured at fair value in the financial statements, these would be classified as Level 2. As of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, the estimated fair value of the 2026 Sustainability Notes would be $
356
million and $
351
million, respectively, and the estimated fair value of the 2031 Notes would be $
487
million and $
475
million, respectively, which is based on Level 2 inputs.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
Litigation and Other Legal Matters
The Company is subject to certain contingent liabilities with respect to existing or potential claims, lawsuits and other proceedings. The Company accrues liabilities when it considers it to be probable that future costs will be incurred and such costs can be reasonably estimated. Proceeding-related liabilities are based on developments to date and historical information related to actions filed against the Company. As of March 31, 2025, the Company had accounted for estimated liabilities involving proceeding-related contingencies and other estimated contingencies of
$
153
million
(net of judicial deposits) within non current other liabilities to cover legal actions against the Company for which Management has assessed the likelihood of a final adverse outcome as probable. Expected legal costs related to litigations are accrued when the legal service is actually provided.
In addition, as of March 31, 2025, the Company and its subsidiaries are subject to certain legal actions considered by the Company’s Management and its legal counsels to be reasonably possible of resulting in a loss for an estimated aggregate amount up to
$
276
million
.
No
loss amounts have been accrued for such reasonably possible legal actions.

Tax Claims
Exclusion of ICMS tax benefits from federal taxes base
The tax claim related to the exclusion of ICMS tax benefits from the tax base of the Corporate Income Tax (“IRPJ”) and of the Social Contribution on Net Profits (“CSLL”) is described in Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements in the Company’s 2024
10-K. On April 4, 2025, the case, whose risk of losing was deemed not more likely than not, became final and unappealable in favor of the Company in relation to the period up to December 2023. The Company had recorded a corresponding income tax benefit arising from the ICMS tax incentives from September 2021 up to December 2023, which amounted to
$
36
million
considering the exchange rate as of March 31, 2025.
Buyer protection program
The buyer protection program (“BPP”) is designed to protect buyers in the Marketplace from losses due primarily to fraud or counterparty non-performance for all transactions completed through the Company’s online payment solution Mercado Pago (except for certain excluded categories). The Company’s BPP provides protection to consumers by reimbursing them for the total value of a purchased item and the value of any shipping service paid if it does not arrive, arrives incomplete or damaged, does not match the seller’s description or if the buyer regrets the purchase. The Company is entitled to recover from the third-party carrier companies performing the shipping service certain amounts paid under the BPP. Furthermore, in some specific circumstances, the Company enters into insurance contracts with third-party insurance companies in order to cover contingencies that may arise from the BPP.
The maximum potential exposure under this program is estimated to be the volume of payments on the Marketplace, for which claims may be made under the terms and conditions of the Company’s BPP. Based on historical losses to date, the Company does not believe that the maximum potential exposure is representative of the actual potential exposure. The Company records a liability with respect to losses under this program when they are probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated.
As of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, Management’s estimate of the maximum potential exposure related to the Company’s buyer protection program is $
5,546
million and $
5,769
million, respectively, for which the Company recorded a provision of $
12
million and $
14
million, respectively.
Commitments
The Company has committed to purchase cloud platform and other technology services for a total minimum aggregate purchase commitment of $
3,215
million. As of March 31, 2025, the remaining purchase commitment is $
2,944
million.
The Company has signed a
10-year
agreement with Gol Linhas Aereas S.A. under which the Company is committed to contract a minimum amount of air logistics services for a total cost of $
331
million (portion allocated to the services component of the agreement). As of March 31, 2025, the remaining purchase commitment is $
272
million.
Since October 2023, the Company has signed
3-year
agreements with certain shipping companies in Brazil, under which the Company committed to contract a minimum amount of logistics services for a total cost of $
53
million. As of March 31, 2025, the remaining commitment amounted to $
37
million.
As of March 31, 2025, the Company has lease agreements for new warehouses in Brazil, Mexico and Argentina, for a total amount of $
1,364
million, that have not yet commenced. Lease terms under the agreements are between
3
to
15
years.
The Company has unconditional purchase obligations related to capital expenditures for a total amount of $
34
million. As of March 31, 2025, the remaining purchase commitment is $
11
million.

On September 27, 2024, the Company entered into a $
400
million amended and restated revolving credit agreement (the “Amended and Restated Credit Agreement”) with the lenders party thereto and the Company’s subsidiaries MercadoLibre S.R.L., Ebazar.com.br Ltda., Mercado Pago Instituição de Pagamento Ltda., DeRemate.com de Mexico S. de R.L. de C.V., MP Agregador, S. de R.L. de C.V., MercadoLibre Chile Ltda., and MercadoLibre Colombia Ltda. as initial guarantors. As a result of the DeRemate Spinoff, MPFS, S. de R.L. de C.V. will become a guarantor under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement in accordance with its terms. The Company’s obligations under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement are guaranteed by the guarantors, as stated before.
The interest rates under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement are based on Term SOFR (“Secured Overnight Funding Rate”) plus an interest margin of
1.00
% per annum, which may be decreased to

The Company is also obligated to pay a commitment fee on the unused amounts of the facility at a rate per annum equal to
25

NOTE 13.
SECURITIZATION TRANSACTIONS
The process of securitization consists of the issuance of securities collateralized by a pool of assets through a special purpose entity (“SPEs”), often under a VIE.
The Company securitizes financial assets associated with its credit card receivables and loans receivable portfolio. The Company’s securitization transactions typically involve the legal transfer of financial assets to bankruptcy remote SPEs. The Company generally retains economic interests in the collateralized securitization transactions, which are retained in the form of subordinated interests. For accounting purposes, the Company is generally precluded from recording the transfers of assets in securitization transactions as sales and is required to consolidate the SPE.
The Company securitizes certain credit card receivables related to users’ purchases through Chilean SPEs. Under these SPE contracts, the Company has determined that it has no obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits of the SPEs that could be significant because it does not retain any equity certificate of participation or subordinated interest in the SPEs. As the Company does not control the vehicles, its assets, liabilities and related results are not consolidated in the Company’s financial statements.
Additionally, the Company securitizes certain credit card receivables related to users’ purchases through Brazilian SPEs. Under these SPE contracts, the Company has determined that it has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits of the SPEs that could be significant because it retains subordinated interest in the SPEs. As the Company controls the vehicles, the assets, liabilities and related results are consolidated in its financial statements.
The Company securitizes certain loans receivable through Brazilian, Argentine, Mexican and Chilean SPEs, formed to securitize loans receivable provided by the Company to its users or purchased from financial institutions that grant loans to the Company’s users through Mercado Pago. According to the SPE contracts, the Company has determined that it has both the power to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact the entity’s performance and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits of the entity that could be significant because it retains the equity certificates of participation and would therefore also be consolidated.

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS
Cash flow hedges
As of March 31, 2025, the Company used foreign currency exchange contracts to hedge the foreign currency effects related to the forecasted purchase of MPOs devices in U.S. dollars owed by a Brazilian subsidiary and hosting and licenses expenses payable in U.S. dollars owed by Brazilian and Mexican subsidiaries, whose functional currencies are the Brazilian Real and the Mexican Peso, respectively. The Company designated the foreign currency exchange contracts as cash flow hedges, the derivatives’ gain or loss is initially reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss and subsequently reclassified into the interim condensed consolidated statements of income in the “Cost of net revenues and financial expenses," “Product and technology development” expenses and “Foreign currency losses, net” line items, in the same period the forecasted transaction affects earnings. As of March 31, 2025, the Company estimated that the whole amount of net derivative gains or losses related to its cash flow hedges included in accumulated other comprehensive loss will be reclassified into the interim condensed consolidated statements of income within the next 12 months.
Fair value hedges
The Company has entered into swap contracts to hedge the interest rate and the foreign currency exposure of its fixed-rate, foreign currency financial debt held by its Brazilian subsidiaries. The Company designated the swap contracts as fair value hedges. The derivatives’ gain or loss is reported in the interim condensed consolidated statements of income in the same line items as the change in the value of the financial debt due to the hedged risks. Since the terms of the interest rate swaps match the terms of the hedged debts, changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps are offset by changes in the fair value of the hedged debts attributable to changes in interest rates. Accordingly, the net impact in current earnings is that the interest expense associated with the hedged debts is recorded at the floating rates.
The Company also uses future contracts to hedge the interest rate exposure of its asset-backed loan portfolio originated in Brazil. In these cases, where the assets included in the portfolio shared the same risk exposure, the Company designated the future contracts as fair value hedges under the portfolio layer method. The derivatives’ gain or loss is reported in the interim condensed consolidated statements of income in the same line items as the change in the value of the financial assets due to the hedged risks. Accordingly, the Company will unlock its portfolio's fixed-rate to mitigate the effect of interest rate fluctuations.
Net investment hedge
The Company used cross currency swap contracts, to reduce the foreign currency exchange risk related to its investment in its Brazilian foreign subsidiaries and the interest rate risk. This derivative was designated as a net investment hedge and, accordingly, gains and losses are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss. The derivatives’ gain or loss is initially reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss and subsequently reclassified into the interim condensed consolidated statements of income in the “Interest expense and other financial losses” and “Foreign currency losses, net” line items, in the same period that the interest expense affects earnings.  As of March 31, 2025, there are no outstanding derivatives hedging the interest rate fluctuation of the financial debt designated as cash flow hedges.

As of March 31, 2025, there are no outstanding derivatives hedging the foreign currency fluctuation not designated as hedging instruments.
Finally, as of March 31, 2025, the Company entered into swap contracts to hedge the interest rate fluctuation of a certain portion of its financial debt in its Brazilian subsidiaries and VIEs. These transactions were not designated as hedges for accounting purposes.

Business Overview
We are the leading online commerce and fintech ecosystem in Latin America. Our e-commerce platform is the leader in the region based on gross merchandise volume (“GMV”), and our fintech platform is the leader in monthly active users (“MAUs”) among fintech companies in Mexico, Argentina and Chile, and the second largest in Brazil. Mercado Libre's e-commerce platform is present in 18 countries (Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, Chile, Colombia, Peru, Uruguay, Venezuela, Bolivia, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay and El Salvador) and our fintech platform, Mercado Pago, is present in eight countries (Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, Chile, Colombia, Peru, Uruguay and Ecuador). Our ecosystem provides consumers and merchants with a complete portfolio of services to enable buying and selling online and the processing of payments online and offline, as well as offering a wide array of simple day-to-day financial services.
We offer our users an ecosystem of integrated e-commerce and digital financial services, which includes: the Mercado Libre Marketplace, the Mercado Pago fintech platform, the Mercado Envios logistics service, the Mercado Ads solution and the Mercado Libre Classifieds service.
Our e-commerce platform provides buyers and sellers with a robust and safe environment that fosters the development of a large e-commerce community in Latin America, a region with a population of over 650 million people where penetration of e-commerce over total retail significantly lags benchmarks such as the United States of America (“U.S.”), the United Kingdom (“U.K.”) and China. We believe that we offer world-class technological and commercial solutions that address the distinctive cultural and geographic challenges of operating a digital commerce platform in Latin America.
The Mercado Libre Marketplace is a user-friendly online commerce platform that can be accessed through our mobile app or website. Third-party sellers (“3P”) account for most of the GMV transacted on the Marketplace. We complement this by selling directly to consumers on a first-party basis (“1P”) in selected categories where we can enhance price competitiveness and assortment; this accounts for less than 10% of GMV. The Marketplace has an extensive assortment of products, with a wide range of categories including consumer electronics, apparel and beauty, home goods, automotive accessories, toys, books and entertainment and consumer packaged goods. We also have a selection of international products available, primarily from sellers in China and the U.S., through our cross-border trade (“CBT”) operations. Our users can also list vehicles, properties and services they are looking to sell via Mercado Libre Classifieds. These listings differ from our Marketplace listings because we charge placing fees only, not final value fees.
Mercado Envios is a logistics solution that is one of the value-added services that we offer to our sellers and buyers on our platform. The logistics services we offer are an integral and crucial part of our value proposition as they reduce friction between buyers and sellers, allow us to have greater control over the full user experience and enable faster deliveries at a more competitive cost than would otherwise be available with third-party carriers. Sellers that use Mercado Envios are eligible to access shipping subsidies that enable free or discounted shipping for consumers that buy sellers' goods on our Marketplace. Our logistics network is built around fulfillment centers (which accounts for more than half of shipments), where sellers place their inventory in our warehouses, and cross-docking, where we collect items sold from sellers directly or via a network of thousands of partner stores (“MELI Places”) where sellers drop off sold items that need to be fed into our logistics network. MELI Places are also enabled for pick up of items purchased and processing of returns. Our transportation network includes dedicated aircraft, trucks and thousands of last-mile delivery vans, the vast majority of which are owned and operated by our third-party carriers.
Our advertising platform, Mercado Ads, is another value-added service that we offer to sellers on our platform and brands both on- and off-platform. The platform enables sellers and brands to access the millions of consumers who browse and purchase on our Marketplace, as well as the first-party data that all of these engagements generate. This enables advertisers to target highly granular audiences. The products we offer are Product Ads (sponsored listings), Brands Ads (product carrousels), Display Ads (banners) and Video Ads, the last two of which we are able to offer inventory off-platform as well as on our own Marketplace and fintech platform.
Mercado Shops is a service we offer to sellers to complement their business on our Marketplace. It is a digital storefront solution that allows sellers to set up, manage and promote their own digital stores, while using Mercado Libre's logistics, advertising and payments services. In January 2025, we announced the migration of Mercado Shops to “Mi Página,” which offers similar functionalities but is fully embedded within our Marketplace (without an external storefront). Mercado Shops will be discontinued as of December 31, 2025.
Mercado Pago was initially designed to facilitate transactions on Mercado Libre’s Marketplace by providing a mechanism that allowed our users to securely, easily and promptly send and receive payments. This brought trust to the merchant-consumer relationship. In the countries in which Mercado Pago operates, it processes and settles all transactions on our Marketplace.
Beyond facilitating Marketplace transactions, over the years we have expanded our array of Mercado Pago services to third parties outside Mercado Libre’s Marketplace. We began first by satisfying the growing demand for online-based payment solutions by providing merchants the necessary digital payment infrastructure for e-commerce to flourish in Latin America.
Our lending solution is available in Argentina, Brazil, Mexico and Chile. We offer credits mostly to merchants and consumers that already form part of our user base, many of whom have historically been underserved or overlooked by financial institutions and therefore suffer from a lack of access to credit. Facilitating credit is a key service overlay that enables us to further strengthen the engagement and lock-in rate of our users, while also generating additional touchpoints and incentives to use Mercado Pago as an end-to-end financial solution.
Our asset management product, which is available in Argentina, Brazil, Mexico and Chile, is a critical pillar of our financial services offering that enables us to compete with large banks. This product offers remuneration on balances held in the Mercado Pago digital account that is greater than traditional checking and savings accounts. This enables our users to earn a return with funds remaining available for withdrawal or to make payments without their funds being tied up in a time deposit.

As an extension of our asset management and savings solutions for users, we launched a digital assets feature as part of the Mercado Pago account in Brazil, Mexico and Chile, in 2021, 2022 and 2023, respectively. This service allows our millions of users to purchase, hold and sell selected digital assets through our interface without leaving the Mercado Pago application, while a partner acts as the custodian and offers the blockchain infrastructure platform. This feature is available for all users through their Mercado Pago account. In 2024 and 2025 we launched “Meli Dólar,” a stablecoin that is pegged to the US dollar, in Brazil, Mexico and Chile. Members of our loyalty program receive their cashback in Meli Dólar and all Mercado Pago users can buy, hold and sell the stablecoin without charging any fees.
Reporting Segments and Geographic Information
Our segment reporting is based on geography, which is the criterion our Management currently uses to evaluate our segment performance. Our geographic segments are Brazil, Mexico, Argentina and Other Countries (including Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Peru, Uruguay and the U.S.). Although we discuss long-term trends in our business, it is our policy not to provide earnings guidance in the traditional sense. We believe that uncertain conditions make the forecasting of near-term results difficult. Further, we seek to make decisions focused primarily on the long-term welfare of our Company and believe focusing on short-term earnings does not best serve the interests of our stockholders. We believe that execution of key strategic initiatives as well as our expectations for long-term growth in our markets will best create stockholder value. A long-term focus may make it more difficult for industry analysts and the market to evaluate the value of our Company, which could reduce the value of our common stock or permit competitors with short-term tactics to grow more rapidly than us. We, therefore, encourage potential investors to consider this strategy before making an investment in our common stock.
The following table sets forth the percentage of our consolidated net revenues and financial income by segment for the three-month periods ended March 31, 2025 and 2024:
Net revenues and financial income for the three-month period ended March 31, 2025 as compared to the same period in 2024 are described in “Item 2 — Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Principal trends in results of operations— Net revenues and financial income.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
There have been no significant changes in our critical accounting policies, Management estimates or accounting policies since the year ended December 31, 2024 and disclosed in the Company’s 2024 10-K under the heading “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates.”
Results of operations for the three-month period ended March 31, 2025 compared to the three-month period ended March 31, 2024
The selected financial data for the three-month periods ended March 31, 2025 and 2024 discussed herein is derived from our unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 of Part I of this report. The results of operations for the three-month period ended March 31, 2025, are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the full year ending December 31, 2025 or for any other period.
Principal trends in results of operations
Net revenues and financial income
We disaggregate revenues into four geographical reporting segments. Within each of our segments, the services we provide and the products we sell generally fall into two distinct revenue streams: “Commerce” and “Fintech.”
Commerce revenues are mainly generated from:
■
marketplace fees that include final value fees and flat fees. Final value fees represent a percentage of the sale value that is charged to the seller once an item is successfully sold and flat fees represent a fixed charge for certain transactions below a certain merchandise value;
■
first party sales, which are generated when control of the good is transferred, upon delivery to our customers;
■
shipping fees, which are generated when an item is delivered through our shipping service, net of the third-party carrier costs (when we act as an agent). When the Company acts as principal, revenues derived from shipping services are recognized upon delivery of the good to the customer, and presented on a gross basis. In addition, the Company generates storage fees, which are charged to the seller for the utilization of the Company’s fulfillment facilities;

Table of Contents
■
ad sales fees due to advertising services provided to sellers, vendors, brands and others, through product searches (product ads and brand ads) and display formats (including video ads and display programmatic), which are recognized based on the number of clicks and impressions, respectively;
■
classifieds fees due to offerings in vehicles, real estate and services, which are charged to sellers who opt to give their listings greater exposure throughout our websites; and
■
fees from other ancillary businesses.
Fintech revenues and financial income are attributable to:
■
commissions representing a percentage of the payment volume processed that are charged to sellers in connection with off-Marketplace platform transactions;
■
commissions from additional fees we charge when a buyer elects to pay in installments through our Mercado Pago platform, for transactions that occur either on or off our Marketplace platform;
■
interest, cash advances and fees from credit cards, merchant and consumer loans granted under our lending solution;
■
revenues from our asset management product;
■
interest earned on investments as part of Mercado Pago activities, including those required due to fintech regulations, net of interest gains passed through to our Brazilian users in connection with our asset management product;
■
commissions that we charge from transactions carried out with Mercado Pago credit and debit cards;
■
revenues from the sale of mobile points of sale products;
■
revenues from insurtech fees;
■
commissions from additional fees we charge when our sellers elect to withdraw cash; and
■
fees from other ancillary services.
Although we also process payments on the Marketplace, we do not charge sellers an added commission for this service, as it is already included in the Marketplace final value fee that we charge.
We have a highly fragmented customer revenue base given the large numbers of sellers and buyers who use our platforms. For the three-month periods ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, no single customer accounted for more than 5.0% of our net revenues and financial income.
Our net revenues and financial income are generated in multiple foreign currencies and then translated into U.S. dollars at the average monthly exchange rate. The functional currency for each country’s operations is the country’s local currency, except for Argentina, where the functional currency is the U.S. dollar due to Argentina’s status as a highly inflationary economy. Please refer to Note 2 – Summary of significant accounting policies to our unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements for further detail on foreign currency translation.
Our net revenues and financial income grew during the three-month period ended March 31, 2025 as compared to the same period in 2024, boosted by the growth of credit originations from our lending solution, an increase in total payment volume and fees due to payment in installments in our Mercado Pago platform, and the growth in gross merchandise volume.
The following table summarizes our consolidated net revenues and financial income for the three-month periods ended March 31, 2025 and 2024:

See Note 8 – Segments of our unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our net revenues and financial income disaggregated by similar products and services for the three-month periods ended March 31, 2025 and 2024.
Our Commerce revenues grew $807 million, or 32.3%, for the three-month period ended March 31, 2025, as compared to the same period in 2024. This increase in Commerce revenues was primarily attributable to:
■
an increase of $573 million in our Commerce services revenues for the three-month period ended March 31, 2025, mainly related to (i) a 17% increase in gross merchandise volume, and (ii) higher flat fee contributions for low gross merchandise volume transactions. Shipping carrier costs netted against revenues decreased $150 million, from $361 million for the three-month period ended March 31, 2024, to $211 million for the three-month period ended March 31, 2025, mainly due to an increase in the share of shipping services where we act as principal, as opposed to agent; and
■
an increase of $234 million in our revenues from Commerce product sales for the three-month period ended March 31, 2025, as compared to the same period in 2024, mainly in Brazil, Argentina and Mexico.
Our Fintech revenues grew 43.3%, from $1,837 million for the three-month period ended March 31, 2024 to $2,632 million for the three-month period ended March 31, 2025. This increase was mainly generated by:
■
an increase of $376 million in our Credit revenues for the three-month period ended March 31, 2025, mainly as a consequence of higher originations; and
■
an increase of $416 million in our revenues from Financial services and income for the three-month period ended March 31, 2025, mainly related to our financing and off-platform transactional fees, reflecting a 43% increase in our total payment volume.

Brazil
Commerce revenues in Brazil increased 19.8% in the three-month period ended March 31, 2025 as compared to the same period in 2024. This increase was generated by an increase of $158 million in our Commerce services revenues and an increase of $152 million in our revenues from Commerce product sales. Fintech revenues grew by 19.9%, a $201 million increase, during the three-month period ended March 31, 2025 as compared to the same period in 2024, mainly driven by an increase of $180 million in our Credit revenues and an increase of $19 million in our revenues from Financial services and income.
Net revenues growth during the three-month period ended March 31, 2025, as compared to the same period in 2024, were offset by the average increase of Brazil’s exchange rate against U.S. dollar of 18.0%.
Mexico
Commerce revenues in Mexico increased 26.9% in the three-month period ended March 31, 2025 as compared to the same period in 2024. This increase was generated by an increase of $136 million in our Commerce services revenues mainly due to an increase in the share of shipping services where we act as principal, as opposed to agent, and an increase of $29 million in our revenues from Commerce product sales. Fintech revenues grew 24.0%, a $86 million increase, during the three-month period ended March 31, 2025 as compared to the same period in 2024, mainly driven by an increase of $43 million in our revenues from Financial services and income and an increase of $42 million in our Credit revenues.
Net revenues growth during the three-month period ended March 31, 2025, as compared to the same period in 2024, were offset by the average increase of Mexico’s exchange rate against U.S. dollar of 20.2%.
Argentina
Commerce revenues in Argentina increased 137.0% in the three-month period ended March 31, 2025 as compared to the same period in 2024. This increase was generated by an increase of $230 million in our Commerce services revenues mainly due to an increase in the share of shipping services where we act as principal, as opposed to agent, and an increase of $44 million in our revenues from Commerce product sales. Fintech revenues increased 118.8%, a $493 million increase, during the three-month period ended March 31, 2025 as compared to the same period in 2024, mainly driven by an increase of $339 million in our revenues from Financial services and income and an increase of $154 million in our Credit revenues.
For the three-month period ended March 31, 2025, the increase in Argentina's net revenues and financial income was also boosted by the average inter-annual inflation rate in our Argentine segment of 69.1%, which was higher than the average of inter-annual increase of Argentina’s official exchange rate against the U.S. dollar of 26.7%.
The following table sets forth our total net revenues and financial income and the sequential quarterly variation of these net revenues and financial income for the periods described below:

The following table sets forth the growth in net revenues and financial income in local currencies, for the three-month period ended March 31, 2025 as compared to the same period in 2024:
(1)
The local currency revenue growth was calculated by using the average monthly exchange rates for each month during 2024 and applying them to the corresponding months in 2025, so as to calculate what our financial results would have been if exchange rates had remained stable from one year to the next. See also “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section below for details on FX neutral measures.
(2)
For the three-month period ended March 31, 2025, the average inter-annual inflation rate in our Argentine segment of 69.1% was higher than the average inter-annual increase of Argentina’s official exchange rate against U.S. dollar of 26.7%.
Cost of net revenues and financial expenses
Cost of net revenues and financial expenses primarily includes shipping operation costs (including warehousing costs), carrier and other operating costs, cost of goods sold, collection fees, sales taxes, funding costs related to our fintech business, fraud prevention expenses, hosting and site operation fees, certain tax withholding related to export duties, compensation for customer support personnel and depreciation and amortization. The following table presents cost of net revenues and financial expenses for the periods indicated:
For the three-month period ended March 31, 2025 as compared to the same period in 2024, the increase in cost of net revenues and financial expenses was primarily attributable to a: i) $377 million increase in shipping operating and carrier costs mainly due to an increase in the share of shipping services where we act as principal, as opposed to agent; ii) $176 million increase in cost of sales of goods mainly in Brazil, Mexico and Argentina; iii) $113 million increase in collection fees, which was mainly attributable to our Argentinian, Brazilian and Mexican operations as a result of the higher growth of total payment volume of Mercado Pago in those countries; iv) $89 million increase in sales taxes; v) $68 million increase in other fintech costs mainly related to higher funding costs in connection with our lending business; and vi) $32 million increase in hosting and site operation fees.
Our subsidiaries in Brazil, Argentina and Colombia are subject to certain taxes on revenues and financial income, which are classified as a cost of net revenues and financial expenses. These taxes represented 6.7% of net revenues and financial income for the three-month period ended March 31, 2025, and 7.1% for the same period in 2024.
Gross profit margins
Our gross profit margin is defined as total net revenues and financial income minus total cost of net revenues and financial expenses, as a percentage of net revenues and financial income.
Our cost structure is directly affected by the level of operations of our services, and our strategic plan on gross profit is built on factors such as an ample liquidity to fund expenses and investments and a cost-effective capital structure.
For the three-month periods ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, our gross profit margins were 46.7%.
For the three-month period ended March 31, 2025, as compared to the same period in 2024, our gross profit margin remained stable, resulted primarily from an increase in our shipping carrier costs and cost of sales of goods, as a percentage of net revenues and financial income, offset by a decrease of our shipping operating costs, customer experience expenses, sales taxes and collection fees, as a percentage of net revenues and financial income.
In the future, our gross profit margin could decline if we maintain the growth of our sales of goods business, which has a lower pure product margin, building up our logistics network and if we fail to maintain an appropriate relationship between our cost of revenue structure and our net revenues and financial income trend.

Product and technology development expenses
Our product and technology development related expenses consist primarily of compensation for our engineering and web-development staff (including long term retention program compensation), depreciation and amortization expenses related to product and technology development, certain tax withholding related to export duties, telecommunications costs and payments to third-party suppliers who provide technology maintenance services to us. The following table presents product and technology development expenses for the periods indicated:
For the three-month period ended March 31, 2025, the increase in product and technology development expenses as compared to the same period in 2024 was primarily attributable to a: i) $56 million increase in salaries and wages mainly related to the increase of 16% in our product and technology development headcount and increases in amounts accrued under the LTRPs as a consequence of the increase in our common stock price; ii) $20 million increase in other product and technology development expenses mainly related to higher tax withholding in connection with intercompany export services billing duties; and iii) $20 million increase in technology maintenance expenses.
We believe that product and technology development is one of our key competitive advantages and we intend to continue to invest in hiring engineers to meet the increasingly sophisticated product expectations of our customer base.
Sales and marketing expenses
Our sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of costs related to marketing our platforms through online and offline advertising and agreements with portals, search engines and other sales expenses related to strategic marketing initiatives, charges related to our buyer protection program, the salaries of employees involved in these activities (including long term retention program compensation), chargebacks related to our Mercado Pago operations, branding initiatives, marketing activities for our users and depreciation and amortization expenses.
We enter into agreements with portals, search engines, social networks, ad networks and other sites in order to attract Internet users to the Mercado Libre Marketplace and convert them into registered users and active traders on our platform.
We also work intensively on attracting, developing and growing our seller community through our customer support efforts. We have dedicated professionals in most of our operations that work with sellers through trade show participation, seminars and meetings to provide them with important tools and skills to become effective sellers on our platform.
The following table presents sales and marketing expenses for the periods indicated:
For the three-month period ended March 31, 2025, the increase in sales and marketing expenses as compared to the same period in 2024 was primarily attributable to a: i) $54 million increase in online and offline marketing expenses mainly in Brazil and Argentina; ii) $21 million increase in salaries and wages mainly related to the increase of 26% in our sales and marketing headcount and increases in amounts accrued under the LTRPs as a consequence of the increase in our common stock price; iii) $13 million increase in our buyer protection program expenses; iv) $12 million increase in other sales expenses related to strategic marketing initiatives; and v) $10 million increase in chargebacks.

Provision for doubtful accounts
Provision for doubtful accounts consists of the current expected credit losses on our financial assets, mainly loans receivable. The following table presents provision for doubtful accounts expenses for the periods indicated:
For the three-month period ended March 31, 2025, as compared to the same period in 2024, the provision for doubtful accounts increased $229 million, mainly due to the increase in originations growing at 59% (mostly related to the credit card and consumer products).
General and administrative expenses
Our general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries for management and administrative staff, compensation of non-employee directors, long term retention program compensation, expenses for legal, audit and other professional services, contingencies, insurance expenses, office space rental expenses, changes in the fair value of digital assets, travel and business expenses, as well as depreciation and amortization expenses. Our general and administrative expenses include the costs of the following areas: general management, finance, treasury, internal audit, administration, accounting, tax, legal and human resources. The following table presents general and administrative expenses for the periods indicated:
For the three-month period ended March 31, 2025, the increase in general and administrative expenses as compared to the same period in 2024 was primarily attributable to a: i) $28 million losses related to the fair value of digital assets ($12 million loss in the three-month period ended March 31, 2025 compared to a $16 million gain in the three-month period ended March 31, 2024); ii) $14 million increase in legal, tax and other fees; iii) $12 million increase in other general and administrative expenses mainly related to higher tax withholding in connection with intercompany export services billing duties; and iv) $10 million increase in salaries and wages, mainly related to the increase of 11% in general and administrative headcount and increases in amounts accrued under the LTRPs as a consequence of the increase in our common stock price.
Operating income margins
Our operating income margin is defined as income from operations as a percentage of net revenues and financial income.
Our operating income margin is affected by our operating expenses structure, which mainly consists of our employees’ salaries, our sales and marketing expenses related to those activities we incurred to promote our services, provision for doubtful accounts mainly related to our loans receivable portfolio and product and technology development expenses, among other operating expenses. As we continue to grow and focus on expanding our leadership in the region, we will continue to invest in product and technology development, sales and marketing and human resources in order to promote our services and capture long-term business opportunities. As a result, we may experience decreases in our operating income margins.
For the three-month period ended March 31, 2025, as compared to the same period in 2024, our operating income margin increased from 12.2% to 12.9%, mainly explained by a decrease in product and technology development and sales and marketing related expenses, as a percentage of net revenues and financial income. This increase was partially offset by an increase in provision of doubtful accounts, as a percentage of net revenues and financial income.

Other income (expenses), net
Other income (expenses), net consists primarily of interest income derived from our investments and cash equivalents, interest expense and other financial charges related to financial liabilities not related to Mercado Pago’s operations, and foreign currency gains or losses. The following table presents Other income (expenses), net for the periods indicated:
For the three-month period ended March 31, 2025, the increase in other expense, net as compared to the same period in 2024 was primarily attributable to $21 million higher foreign exchange losses mainly due to higher foreign exchange losses from our Argentine and Uruguayan subsidiaries, partially offset by higher foreign exchange gains from our Brazilian subsidiaries. This was partially offset by an increase of $12 million in interest income and other financial gains from financial investments not related to Mercado Pago's operations as a result of higher cash levels invested and higher interest rates (mainly in Brazil and Other countries).
Income tax
We are subject to federal and state income tax in the U.S., as well as foreign taxes in the multiple jurisdictions where we operate. Our tax obligations consist of current and deferred income taxes incurred in these jurisdictions. We account for income taxes following the liability method of accounting. A valuation allowance is recorded when, based on the available evidence, it is more likely than not that all or a portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized. Therefore, our income tax expense consists of taxes currently payable, if any (given that in certain jurisdictions we still have net operating loss carry-forwards), plus the change in our deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of the estimate tax rate, adjusted for discrete items that are accounted for in the relevant period.
The following table presents our income tax expense for the three-month periods ended March 31, 2025 and 2024:
During the three-month period ended March 31, 2025 as compared to the same period in 2024, income tax expense increased mainly as a result of higher income tax expense in Argentina due to higher taxable income in Argentina. This increase was partially offset by lower income tax expense in Brazil in 2025 mainly driven by lower taxable income in Brazil.
The following table summarizes our estimated effective tax rates for the three-month periods ended March 31, 2025 and 2024:

Our estimated effective tax rate for the three-month period ended March 31, 2025 increased as compared to the same period in 2024, mainly as a result of lower deductions related to tax inflation adjustments in Argentina, partially offset by lower taxable foreign exchange gains accounted for in Argentina for local tax purposes that are not recorded for accounting purposes since, under U.S. GAAP, the Argentine operations’ functional currency is the U.S. dollar due to the highly inflationary status of the country.

Segment costs
Brazil
For the three-month period ended March 31, 2025, as compared to the same period in 2024, segment costs increased mainly driven by a: i) $331 million increase in cost of net revenues and financial expenses, mainly attributable to an increase in shipping operating and carrier costs, cost of goods sold as a consequence of an increase in first-party sales, sales taxes, other fintech costs mainly related to higher funding costs in connection with the lending business, collection fees as a consequence of the higher transactions volume of our Mercado Pago business and hosting and site operation fees; ii) $161 million increase in provision for doubtful accounts mainly related to our credit card and consumer credits product growth; and iii) $53 million increase in sales and marketing expenses mainly due to an increase in online and offline marketing expenses and chargebacks.
Mexico
For the three-month period ended March 31, 2025, as compared to the same period in 2024, segment costs increased mainly driven by a: i) $221 million increase in cost of net revenues and financial expenses, mainly attributable to increases in shipping operating and carrier costs mostly due to an increase in the share of shipping services where we act as principal, as opposed to agent, cost of goods sold as a consequence of an increase in first-party sales and collection fees due to higher Mercado Pago penetration; and ii) $44 million increase in provision for doubtful accounts mainly related to our credit card business growth.

Liquidity and capital resources
Our main cash requirement has been working capital to fund Mercado Pago financing operations and our lending business. We also require cash for capital expenditures related to technology infrastructure, software applications, office space, business acquisitions, to build out our logistics capacity and to make interest payments on our loans payable and other financial liabilities.
We have funded Mercado Pago mainly by selling credit card receivables and through credit lines. Additionally, we have financed our Mercado Pago and lending businesses through the securitization of credit card receivables and certain loans through SPEs created in Brazil, Mexico, Chile and Argentina. Finally, we obtained funding through deposit certificates, financial bills, commercial notes and loans from banks in Brazil, and mainly through loans from banks and secured lines of credit in Mexico, Chile, Argentina and Uruguay. Refer to Note 12 – Loans payable and other financial liabilities and Note 13 – Securitization transactions of our unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements for further detail.
On September 27, 2024, we entered into a $400 million amended and restated revolving credit agreement (the “Amended and Restated Credit Agreement”). The interest rates under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement are based on Term SOFR (“Secured Overnight Funding Rate”) plus an interest margin of 1.00% per annum, which may be decreased to 0.90% per annum or increased to 1.15% per annum depending on our debt rating, as further provided under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. We are also obligated to pay a commitment fee on the unused amounts of the facility at a rate per annum equal to 25% of the then Applicable Margin, depending on our debt rating, as further provided under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. As of March 31, 2025, no amounts had been borrowed under the facility. See Note 12 – Loans payable and other financial liabilities of our unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements for further detail.
We have committed to contract minimum amounts of certain services such as cloud platform and other technology services, logistics services and leases. In addition, we have unconditional purchase obligations related to capital expenditures. Please refer to Note 10 – Commitments and Contingencies of our unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements for further detail on purchase commitments.
We and certain financial institutions participate in a supplier finance program (“SFP”) that enables certain of our suppliers, at their own election, to request the payment of their invoices to the financial institutions earlier than the terms stated in our payment policy. Suppliers’ voluntary inclusion of invoices in the SFP does not change our payment terms, the amounts paid or liquidity. The supplier invoices that have been confirmed as valid under the program require payment in full according to the terms established in our payment policies (between 60 and 90 days). There are no assets pledged as security or other forms of guarantees provided for the committed payment to the financial institution. We have no economic interest in a supplier’s decision to participate in the SFP and have no financial impact in connection with the SFP. As of March 31, 2025, the obligations outstanding that the Company has confirmed as valid to the financial institutions amounted to $444 million, and are included in the balance sheet within accounts payable and accrued expenses.
As of March 31, 2025, our main source of liquidity was $3,718 million of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, which excludes $4,341 million of restricted investments mainly related to the Central Bank of Brazil Mandatory Guarantee, and consists of cash generated from operations and proceeds from loans.
As of March 31, 2025, cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and cash equivalents and investments of our non-U.S. subsidiaries amounted to $9,644 million, or 88.5% of our consolidated cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and cash equivalents and investments, and our cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and cash equivalents and investments held outside U.S. amounted to 81.0% of our consolidated cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and cash equivalents and investments. Our non-U.S. dollar-denominated cash and investments are located primarily in Brazil, Mexico and Argentina.

Table of Contents
The following table presents our cash flows from operating activities, investing activities and financing activities for the three-month periods ended March 31, 2025 and 2024:
Net cash provided by operating activities
Net cash provided by operating activities in the three-month period ended March 31, 2025 resulted mainly from our net income of $494 million, adjustments to net income related to non-cash items of $779 million and interest received from investments of $127 million, partially offset by an increase in other assets of $247 million and a decrease in accounts payable and in accrued expenses of $191 million. The $481 million decrease in the net cash provided by operating activities in the three-month period ended March 31, 2025, as compared to the same period in 2024, is mainly explained by the decrease of $669 million in funds payable to customers, the decrease of $272 million in payables and accrued expenses, and the decrease of $205 million in amounts payable due to credit and debit card transactions, partially offset by an increase of $336 million in funds related to credit card receivables and other means of payments, the $289 million increase in the adjustments to net income related to non-cash items and the $150 million increase in net income.
Net cash used in investing activities
Net cash used in investing activities in the three-month period ended March 31, 2025 resulted mainly from the use of $1,235 million related to changes on loans receivable due to loans granted to merchants and consumers, and Mercado Pago credit card utilization under our lending solution net of collections, $337 million related to the net purchases of investments and $272 million in the investments of property and equipment, intangibles assets and intangibles assets at fair value (mainly related to our shipping network and information technology assets in Argentina, Brazil and Mexico). The $376 million increase in net cash used in investing activities in the three-month period ended March 31, 2025, as compared to the same period in 2024, is mainly explained by the $289 million increase in our loans receivables due to loans granted to merchants and consumers, and Mercado Pago credit card utilization under our lending solution net of collections and the $124 million increase in our investments of property and equipment, intangibles assets and intangibles assets at fair value.

For the three-month period ended March 31, 2025, our net cash provided by financing activities resulted primarily from $478 million provided by net loans payables and other financing liabilities, partially offset by $13 million used for the payments of finance lease obligations. The $465 million increase in net cash provided by financing activities in the three-month period ended March 31, 2025, as compared to the same period in 2024, is mainly explained by the increase of $465 million of the cash provided by net loans payables and other financing liabilities.
Debt
Debt Securities Guaranteed by Subsidiaries
On January 14, 2021, we issued $400 million aggregate principal amount of 2.375% Sustainability Notes due 2026 (the “2026 Sustainability Notes”) and $700 million aggregate principal amount of 3.125% Notes due 2031 (the “2031 Notes” and collectively, the “Notes”). The payment of principal, premium, if any, interest, and all other amounts in respect of each of the Notes, is fully and unconditionally guaranteed (the “Subsidiary Guarantees”), jointly and severally, on an unsecured basis, by certain of our subsidiaries (the “Subsidiary Guarantors”). The initial Subsidiary Guarantors were MercadoLibre S.R.L., Ibazar.com Atividades de Internet Ltda., eBazar.com.br Ltda., Mercado Envios Servicos de Logistica Ltda., Mercado Pago Instituição de Pagamento Ltda. (formerly known as “MercadoPago.com Representações Ltda.”), MercadoLibre Chile Ltda., MercadoLibre, S.A. de C.V., Institución de Fondos de Pago Electrónico (formerly known as “MercadoLibre, S. de R.L. de C.V.”), DeRemate.com de México, S. de R.L. de C.V. and MercadoLibre Colombia Ltda. On October 27, 2021, MercadoLibre, S.A. de C.V., Institución de Fondos de Pago Electrónico became an excluded subsidiary pursuant to the terms of the Notes and it was released from its Subsidiary Guaranty. On October 27, 2021, MP Agregador, S. de R.L. de C.V. became a Subsidiary Guarantor under the Notes. On July 1 and October 1, 2022, Ibazar.com Atividades de Internet Ltda. and Mercado Envios Servicos de Logistica Ltda. were merged into eBazar.com.br Ltda., respectively. On May 2, 2025, as a result of the spin-off of DeRemate.com de México, S. de R.L. de C.V. completed in January 2025 (the “DeRemate Spinoff”), MPFS, S. de R.L. de C.V. became a Subsidiary Guarantor under the Notes.
We pay interest on the Notes on January 14 and July 14 of each year, beginning on July 14, 2021. The 2026 Sustainability Notes will mature on January 14, 2026, and the 2031 Notes will mature on January 14, 2031.
The Notes rank equally in right of payment with all of the Company’s other existing and future senior unsecured debt obligations. Each Subsidiary Guarantee will rank equally in right of payment with all of the Subsidiary Guarantor’s other existing and future senior unsecured debt obligations, except for statutory priorities under applicable local law.
Each Subsidiary Guarantee will be limited to the maximum amount that would not render the Subsidiary Guarantor’s obligations subject to avoidance under applicable fraudulent conveyance provisions of applicable law. By virtue of this limitation, a Subsidiary Guarantor’s obligation under its Subsidiary Guarantee could be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Notes, or a Subsidiary Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Subsidiary Guarantee.
Under the indenture governing the Notes, the Subsidiary Guarantee of a Subsidiary Guarantor will terminate upon: (i) the sale, exchange, disposition or other transfer (including by way of consolidation or merger) of the Subsidiary Guarantor or the sale or disposition of all or substantially all the assets of the Subsidiary Guarantor (other than to the Company or a Subsidiary) otherwise permitted by the indenture, (ii) satisfaction of the requirements for legal or covenant defeasance or discharge of the Notes, (iii) the release or discharge of the guarantee by such Subsidiary Guarantor of the Triggering Indebtedness (as defined in the applicable indenture) or the repayment of the Triggering Indebtedness, in each case, that resulted in the obligation of such Subsidiary to become a Subsidiary Guarantor, provided that in no event shall the Subsidiary Guarantee of an Initial Subsidiary Guarantor terminate pursuant to this provision, or (iv) such Subsidiary Guarantor becoming an Excluded Subsidiary (as defined in the applicable indenture) or ceasing to be a Subsidiary.
We may, at our option, redeem the 2026 Sustainability Notes, in whole or in part, at any time prior to December 14, 2025 (the date that is one month prior to the maturity of the 2026 Sustainability Notes) and the 2031 Notes, in whole or in part, at any time prior to October 14, 2030 (the date that is three months prior to the maturity of the 2031 Notes), in each case by paying 100% of the principal amount of such Notes so redeemed plus the applicable “make-whole” amount and accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any. We may, at our option, redeem the 2026 Sustainability Notes, in whole or in part, on December 14, 2025 or at any time thereafter and the 2031 Notes on October 14, 2030 or at any time thereafter, in each case at the redemption price of 100% of the principal amount of such Notes so redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any. If we experience certain change of control triggering events, we may be required to offer to purchase the notes at 101% of their principal amount plus any accrued and unpaid interest thereon through the purchase date.
During 2024, we repurchased $27 million and $81 million in principal amount of the outstanding 2026 Sustainability Notes and 2031 Notes, respectively. The total amount paid during 2024 for those repurchases amounted to $98 million. During the three-month period ended March 31, 2025, we made no repurchases of the 2026 Sustainability Notes or the 2031 Notes.
See Note 12 – Loans payable and other financial liabilities of our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for additional detail.
We are presenting the following summarized financial information for the issuer and the Subsidiary Guarantors (together, the “Obligor Group”) pursuant to Rule 13-01 of Regulation S-X, Guarantors and Issuers of Guaranteed Securities Registered or Being Registered. For purposes of the following summarized financial information, transactions between the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors, presented on a combined basis, have been eliminated. Financial information for the non-guarantor subsidiaries, and any investment in a non-guarantor subsidiary by the Company or by any Subsidiary Guarantor, have been excluded.

Non-GAAP Measures of Financial Performance
To supplement our unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, we present earnings before interest income and other financial gains, interest expense and other financial losses, foreign currency losses, net, income tax expense and depreciation and amortization (“Adjusted EBITDA”), net debt, foreign exchange (“FX”) neutral measures and Adjusted free cash flow and Net increase (decrease) in available cash and investments as non-GAAP measures. Reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures can be found in the tables below.
These non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. Non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our results of operations as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures should only be used to evaluate our results of operations in conjunction with the most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures.
We believe that reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure provides investors an overall understanding of our current financial performance and its prospects for the future.
Adjusted EBITDA
Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that represents our net income, adjusted to eliminate the effect of depreciation and amortization charges, interest income and other financial gains, interest expense and other financial losses, foreign currency losses, net and income tax expense. We have included this non-GAAP financial measure because it is used by our Management to evaluate our operating performance and trends, make strategic decisions and the calculation of leverage ratios. Accordingly, we believe this measure provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our Management. In addition, it provides a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our business, as it removes the effect of certain items.
The following table presents a reconciliation of net income to Adjusted EBITDA for the periods indicated:
Net debt
We define net debt as total debt which includes current and non-current loans payable and other financial liabilities and current and non-current operating lease liabilities, less cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and long-term investments, excluding time deposits and foreign government debt securities restricted and held in guarantee, securitization transactions and equity securities held at cost. We have included this non-GAAP financial measure because it is used by our Management to analyze our current leverage ratios and set targets to be met, which will also impact other components of the Company’s balance sheet, cash flows and income statement. Accordingly, we believe this measure provides useful information to investors and other market participants in showing the evolution of the Company’s indebtedness and its capability of repayment as a means to, alongside other measures, monitor our leverage based on widely-used measures.

The following table presents a reconciliation of net debt for each of the periods indicated:
(1)
Excludes time deposits and foreign government debt securities restricted and held in guarantee.
(2)
Excludes foreign government debt securities restricted, investments held in VIEs as a consequence of securitization transactions and equity securities held at cost.
FX neutral
We believe that FX neutral measures provide useful information to both Management and investors by excluding the foreign currency exchange rate impact that may not be indicative of our core operating results and business outlook.
The FX neutral measures were calculated by using the average monthly exchange rates for each month during 2024 and applying them to the corresponding months in 2025, so as to calculate what our results would have been had exchange rates remained stable from one year to the next. The table below excludes intercompany allocation FX effects. Finally, these measures do not include any other macroeconomic effect such as local currency inflation effects, the impact on impairment calculations or any price adjustment to compensate local currency inflation or devaluations.
The following table sets forth the FX neutral measures related to our reported results of the operations for the three-month period ended March 31, 2025:

Adjusted free cash flow and Net increase (decrease) in available cash and investments
Adjusted free cash flow
Adjusted free cash flow represents cash from operating activities less the increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents and investments related to customer funds due to regulatory requirements and other restrictions and equity securities held at cost, investments in property and equipment and intangible assets, changes in loans receivable, net and net proceeds from/payments on loans payable and other financial liabilities related to our Fintech solutions, since we consider those liabilities as the working capital of the Fintech activities. We consider adjusted free cash flow to be a measure of liquidity generation that provides useful information to management and investors since it shows how much cash the Company generates with its core activities that can be used for discretionary purposes and to repay its corporate and/or commerce debt. A limitation of the utility of adjusted free cash flow as a measure of liquidity generation is that it is a partial representation of the total increase or decrease in our available cash and investments balance for the period. Therefore, we believe it is important to view the adjusted free cash flow measure only as a complement to our entire consolidated statements of cash flows.
Net increase (decrease) in available cash and investments
Net increase (decrease) in available cash and investments represents adjusted free cash flow less net proceeds from/payments on loans payable and other financial liabilities, related to our Commerce and corporate activities, payments of finance lease obligations, other investing and/or financing activities not considered above and the effect of exchange rates changes on available cash and investments. We consider Net increase (decrease) in available cash and investments to be a measure of liquidity availability that provides useful information to management and investors after netting out all other debt and corporate payments and activities from the adjusted free cash flow.
The following table shows a reconciliation of Net cash provided by operating activities to Adjusted free cash flow and Net increase in available cash and investments:
(1)
Includes accrued interest and financial income net of interest received from available and restricted investments.
(2)
Includes cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments (excluding time deposits and foreign government debt securities restricted and held in guarantee) and long-term investments (excluding foreign government debt securities restricted, investments held in VIEs as a consequence of securitization transactions and equity securities held at cost).

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
We are exposed to market risks arising from our business operations. These market risks arise mainly from macroeconomic instability and the possibility that changes in interest rates and the U.S. dollar exchange rate with local currencies, particularly the Brazilian Real, Mexican Peso and Argentine Peso due to Brazil’s, Mexico’s and Argentina’s respective share of our revenues, may affect the value of our financial assets and liabilities.
We are also exposed to market risks arising from our LTRPs. These market risks arise from our obligations to pay employees cash payments in amounts that vary based on the market price of our stock.
Foreign currencies
We have significant operations internationally that are denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the Brazilian Real, Argentine Peso, Mexican Peso, Colombian Peso and Chilean Peso, subjecting us to foreign currency risk, which may adversely impact our financial results. We transact business in various foreign currencies and have significant international revenues and costs. In addition, we charge our international subsidiaries for their use of intellectual property and technology and for certain corporate services. Our cash flows, results of operations and certain of our intercompany balances that are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations may differ materially from expectations and we may record significant gains or losses due to foreign currency fluctuations and related hedging activities.
We use foreign currency exchange forward contracts and currency swaps to protect our foreign currency exposure and our investment in a foreign subsidiary from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These hedging contracts reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the impact of adverse foreign currency exchange rate movements. We designate these contracts as cash flow, net investment and fair value hedges for accounting purposes. The derivatives’ gain or loss for cash flow and net investment hedges is initially reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss. Cash flow hedges and net investment hedges are subsequently reclassified into the interim condensed consolidated statements of income in the financial statement line item in which the hedged item is recorded in the same period the forecasted transaction affects earnings. The derivatives’ gain or loss for fair value hedges is reported in our interim condensed consolidated statements of income in the same line items as the change in the value of the hedged item due to the hedged risks.
As of March 31, 2025, we hold cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and cash equivalents, short and long-term investments in local currencies in our subsidiaries, and have receivables denominated in local currencies in all of our operations. Our subsidiaries generate revenues and incur most of their expenses in the respective local currencies of the countries in which they operate. As a result, our subsidiaries use their local currency as their functional currency except for our Argentine subsidiaries, whose functional currency is the U.S. dollar due to the inflationary environment. As of March 31, 2025, the total cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and cash equivalents denominated in foreign currencies totaled $3,789 million, short-term investments denominated in foreign currencies totaled $4,456 million, long-term investments denominated in foreign currencies totaled $540 million and accounts receivable, credit card receivables and other means of payment (including those presented within non-current other assets) and loans receivable in foreign currencies totaled $11,632 million. To manage exchange rate risk, our treasury policy is to transfer most cash and cash equivalents in excess of working capital requirements into U.S. dollar-denominated accounts in the United States and to enter into certain foreign exchange derivatives, such as currency forwards contracts, in order to mitigate our exposure to foreign exchange risk. As of March 31, 2025, our U.S. dollar-denominated cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments totaled $1,335 million and our U.S. dollar-denominated long-term investments totaled $781 million.
For the three-month period ended March 31, 2025, we had a consolidated loss on foreign currency of $55 million, mainly related to foreign exchange losses from our Argentine subsidiaries. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Results of operations— Other income (expenses), net” for more information.
Foreign currency sensitivity analysis

The table above shows an increase in our net income when the U.S. dollar weakens against foreign currencies because of the positive impact of the increase in income from operations. On the other hand, the table above shows a decrease in our net income when the U.S. dollar strengthens against foreign currencies because of the negative impact of the decrease in income from operations.
Brazilian segment
Considering a hypothetical increase of 10% of the Brazilian Real exchange rate against the U.S. dollar on March 31, 2025, the reported net assets in our Brazilian subsidiaries would have decreased by approximately $324 million with the related impact in Other Comprehensive Income. Additionally, we would have recorded a foreign currency loss amounting to approximately $57 million in our Brazilian subsidiaries.
Mexican segment
Considering a hypothetical increase of 10% of the Mexican Peso exchange rate against the U.S. dollar on March 31, 2025, the reported net assets in our Mexican subsidiaries would have decreased by approximately $156 million with the related impact in Other Comprehensive Income. Additionally, we would have recorded a foreign currency loss amounting to approximately $17 million in our Mexican subsidiaries.
Argentine segment
In accordance with U.S. GAAP, we have classified our Argentine operations as highly inflationary since July 1, 2018, using the U.S. dollar as the functional currency for purposes of reporting our financial statements. Therefore, no translation effect has been accounted for in other comprehensive income related to our Argentine operations since July 1, 2018. Argentina’s inflation rate for the three-month periods ended March 31, 2025 and 2024 was 8.6% and 51.6%, respectively.
We use Argentina’s official exchange rate to account for transactions in our Argentine segment, which as of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024 was 1,074.00 and 1,032.00 Argentine Pesos, respectively, against the U.S. dollar. For the three-month periods ended March 31, 2025 and 2024 Argentina’s official exchange rate against the U.S. dollar increased 4.1% and 6.1%, respectively. The average exchange rate for the three-month periods ended March 31, 2025 and 2024 was 1,057.00 and 834.46, respectively, resulting in an increase of 26.7%.
Considering a hypothetical increase of 10% of the Argentine Peso exchange rate against the U.S. dollar on March 31, 2025, the effect on non-functional currency net asset position in our Argentine subsidiaries would have been a foreign exchange loss amounting to approximately $97 million in our Argentine subsidiaries.
See Note 2 – Summary of significant accounting policies - Foreign currency translation - Argentine currency status and Argentine exchange regulations” of our unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements for further detail on the currency status and the exchange regulations of our Argentine segment.
Interest
Our earnings and cash flows are also affected by changes in interest rates. These changes could have an impact on the interest rates that financial institutions charge us prior to the time we sell our credit card receivables and on the financial debt that we use to fund Mercado Pago and lending’s operations. As of March 31, 2025, Credit card receivables and other means of payments, net totaled $5,646 million (includes $114 million presented within non-current other assets in the interim condensed consolidated balance sheets). Interest rate fluctuations could also impact interest earned through our lending solution. As of March 31, 2025, loans receivable net of the allowance for doubtful accounts from our lending solution totaled $5,726 million. Interest rate fluctuations could also negatively affect certain of our fixed rate and floating rate investments comprised primarily of time deposits, money market funds and sovereign debt securities. Investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning products carry a degree of interest rate risk. Fixed rate securities may have their fair value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than predicted if interest rates fall.
As of March 31, 2025, our short-term investments amounted to $5,082 million and our long-term investments amounted to $1,321 million. Our short-term investments can be readily converted at any time into cash or into securities with a shorter remaining time to maturity. We determine the appropriate classification of our investments at the time of purchase and re-evaluate such designations as of each balance sheet date. See Note 3 – Fintech Regulations and Note 4 – Cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and cash equivalents and investments of our unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements for further detail on our restricted investments.
Fluctuations of the interest rate could also have a negative impact on interest expense related to our Loans payable and other financial liabilities, as a portion of these instruments is subject to variable interest rates. As of March 31, 2025, our Loans payable and other financial liabilities which accrue interest based on variable rates amounted to $4,451 million, while our Loans payable and other financial liabilities, which accrue interest based on fixed rates, amounted to $1,982 million. See Note 12 – Loans payable and other financial liabilities and Note 13 – Securitization transactions of our unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements for further detail. Considering a hypothetical increase of 100 basis points in the interest rates, the reported charge to the interim condensed consolidated statements of income for the three-month period ended March 31, 2025 would have increased by approximately $11 million with the impact in Cost of net revenues and financial expenses or in Interest expense and other financial losses. We have entered into swap and future contracts to hedge the interest rate fluctuation of $745 million notional amount, $634 million of which have been designated as hedging instruments. See Note 15 – Derivative instruments of our unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements for further detail on derivative instruments.

the eligible employee will receive 16.66% of half of his or her target 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, 2024 and/or 2025 LTRP bonus once a year for a period of six years, with the first payment occurring no later than April 30, 2021, 2022, 2023, 2024, 2025 and 2026, respectively (the “2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, 2024 or 2025 Annual Fixed Payment,” respectively); and
■
on each date we pay the respective Annual Fixed Payment to an eligible employee, he or she will also receive a payment (the “2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, 2024 or 2025 Variable Payment”) equal to the product of (i) 16.66% of half of the target 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, 2024 and/or 2025 LTRP bonus and (ii) the quotient of (a) divided by (b), where (a), the numerator, equals the Applicable Year Stock Price (as defined below) and (b), the denominator, equals the average closing price of our common stock on the NASDAQ Global Select Market during the final 60 trading days of 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023 and 2024 defined as $553.45, $1,431.26, $1,391.81, $888.69, $1,426.11 and $1,944.47 for the 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, 2024 and 2025 LTRPs, respectively. The “Applicable Year Stock Price” shall equal the average closing price of our common stock on the NASDAQ Global Select Market during the final 60 trading days of the year preceding the applicable payment date.
As of March 31, 2025, the total contractual obligation fair value of our outstanding LTRP Variable Payment obligation subject to equity price risk amounted to $738 million.
