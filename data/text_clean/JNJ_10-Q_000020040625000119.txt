Cautionary note regarding forward-looking statements
This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and Johnson & Johnson’s other publicly available documents contain “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Management and representatives of Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries (the Company) also may from time to time make forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements do not relate strictly to historical or current facts and reflect management’s assumptions, views, plans, objectives and projections about the future. Forward-looking statements may be identified by the use of words such as “plans,” “expects,” “will,” “anticipates,” “estimates,” and other words of similar meaning in conjunction with, among other things: discussions of future operations, expected operating results, financial performance; impact of planned acquisitions and dispositions; impact and timing of restructuring initiatives including associated cost savings and other benefits; the Company’s strategy for growth; product development activities; regulatory approvals; market position and expenditures.
Because forward-looking statements are based on current beliefs, expectations and assumptions regarding future events, they are subject to uncertainties, risks and changes that are difficult to predict and many of which are outside of the Company’s control. Investors should realize that if underlying assumptions prove inaccurate, or known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize, the Company’s actual results and financial condition could vary materially from expectations and projections expressed or implied in its forward-looking statements. Investors are therefore cautioned not to rely on these forward-looking statements. Risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to:
Risks related to product development, market success and competition
•
Challenges and uncertainties inherent in innovation and development of new and improved products and technologies on which the Company’s continued growth and success depend, including uncertainty of clinical outcomes, additional analysis of existing clinical data, obtaining regulatory approvals, health plan coverage and customer access, and initial and continued commercial success;
•
Challenges to the Company’s ability to secure and maintain adequate patent and other intellectual property rights for new and existing products and technologies in the United States and other important markets;
•
The impact of patent expirations, typically followed by the introduction of competing generic, biosimilar or other products and resulting revenue and market share losses;
•
Increasingly aggressive and frequent challenges to the Company’s patents by competitors and others seeking to launch competing generic, biosimilar or other products and increased receptivity of courts, the United States Patent and Trademark Office and other decision makers to such challenges, potentially resulting in loss of market exclusivity and rapid decline in sales for the relevant product sooner than expected;
•
Competition in research and development of new and improved products, processes and technologies, which can result in product and process obsolescence;
•
Competition to reach agreement with third parties for collaboration, licensing, development and marketing agreements for products and technologies;
•
Competition based on cost-effectiveness, product performance, technological advances and patents attained by competitors; and
•
Allegations that the Company’s products infringe the patents and other intellectual property rights of third parties, which could adversely affect the Company’s ability to sell the products in question and require the payment of money damages and future royalties.
Risks related to product liability, litigation and regulatory activity
•
Product efficacy or safety concerns, whether or not based on scientific evidence, potentially resulting in product withdrawals, recalls, regulatory action on the part of the United States Food and Drug Administration (U.S. FDA) (or international counterparts), declining sales, reputational damage, increased litigation expense and share price impact;
•
The impact, including declining sales and reputational damage, of significant litigation or government action adverse to the Company, including product liability claims and allegations related to pharmaceutical marketing practices and contracting strategies;
•
The impact of an adverse judgment or settlement and the adequacy of reserves related to legal proceedings, including patent litigation, product liability, personal injury claims, securities class actions, government investigations, employment and other legal proceedings;
•
Increased scrutiny of the healthcare industry by government agencies and state attorneys general resulting in investigations and prosecutions, which carry the risk of significant civil and criminal penalties, including, but not limited to, debarment from government business;
•
Failure to meet compliance obligations in compliance agreements with governments or government agencies, which could result in significant sanctions;
•

Intangible assets and goodwill
Intangible assets that have finite useful lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives. The latest annual impairment assessment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets was completed in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2024. Future impairment tests for goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets will be performed annually in the fiscal fourth quarter, or sooner, if warranted.

The majority is comprised of customer relationships
Goodwill as of March 30, 2025 was allocated by segment of business as follows:
The weighted average amortization period for patents and trademarks is approximately
12
years. The weighted average amortization period for customer relationships and other intangible assets is approximately
19
years. The amortization expense of amortizable intangible assets included in the cost of products sold was $
1.1
billion for both of the fiscal first quarters ended March 30, 2025 and March 31, 2024.
The estimated amortization expense for approved products, before tax, for the five succeeding years is approximately:

Note 4 —
Fair value measurements
The Company uses forward foreign exchange contracts to manage its exposure to the variability of cash flows, primarily related to the foreign exchange rate changes of future intercompany product and third-party purchases of materials denominated in a foreign currency. The Company uses cross currency interest rate swaps to manage currency risk primarily related to borrowings. Both types of derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges.
Additionally, the Company uses interest rate swaps as an instrument to manage interest rate risk related to fixed rate borrowings.  These derivatives are designated as fair value hedges. The Company uses cross currency interest rate swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts designated as net investment hedges. Additionally, the Company uses forward foreign exchange contracts to offset its exposure to certain foreign currency assets and liabilities. These forward foreign exchange contracts are not designated as hedges, and therefore, changes in the fair values of these derivatives are recognized in earnings, thereby offsetting the current earnings effect of the related foreign currency assets and liabilities.
The Company does not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes, or that contain credit risk related contingent features. The Company maintains credit support agreements (CSA) with certain derivative counterparties establishing collateral thresholds based on respective credit ratings and netting agreements. As of March 30, 2025, the cumulative amount of cash collateral paid by the Company under the CSA amounted to $
1.9
billion net, related to net investment and cash flow hedges. On an ongoing basis, the Company monitors counter-party credit ratings. The Company considers credit non-performance risk to be low because the Company primarily enters into agreements with commercial institutions that have at least an investment grade credit rating.  Refer to the table on significant financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value contained in this footnote for receivables and payables with these commercial institutions. As of March 30, 2025, the Company had notional amounts outstanding for forward foreign exchange contracts, cross currency interest rate swaps and interest rate swaps of $
45.2
billion, $
40.0
billion and $
9.0
billion, respectively. As of December 29, 2024, the Company had notional amounts outstanding for forward foreign exchange contracts, cross currency interest rate swaps and interest rate swaps of $
45.1
billion, $
40.5
billion and $
9.0
billion, respectively.
All derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income, depending on whether the derivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction, and if so, the type of hedge transaction.
The designation as a cash flow hedge is made at the entrance date of the derivative contract. At inception, all derivatives are expected to be highly effective. Foreign exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges are accounted for under the forward method and all gains/losses associated with these contracts will be recognized in the income statement when the hedged item impacts earnings. Changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income until the underlying transaction affects earnings and are then reclassified to earnings in the same account as the hedged transaction.
Gains and losses associated with interest rate swaps and changes in fair value of hedged debt attributable to changes in interest rates are recorded to interest expense in the period in which they occur.  Gains and losses on net investment hedges are accounted for through the currency translation account within accumulated other comprehensive income. The portion excluded from effectiveness testing is recorded through interest (income) expense using the spot method. On an ongoing basis, the Company assesses whether each derivative continues to be highly effective in offsetting changes of hedged items. If and when a derivative is no longer expected to be highly effective, hedge accounting is discontinued.
The Company designated its Euro denominated notes with due dates ranging from 2028 to 2055 as a net investment hedge of the Company's investments in certain of its international subsidiaries that use the Euro as their functional currency in order to reduce the volatility caused by changes in exchange rates.
As of March 30, 2025, the balance of deferred net loss on derivatives included in accumulated other comprehensive income was $
1.2
billion after-tax. For additional information, see the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income and Note 7. The Company expects that substantially all of the amounts related to forward foreign exchange contracts will be reclassified into earnings over the next 12 months as a result of transactions that are expected to occur over that period. The maximum length of time over which the Company is hedging transaction exposure is
18
months, excluding interest rate contracts and net investment hedge contracts. The amount ultimately realized in earnings may differ as foreign exchange rates change. Realized gains and losses are ultimately determined by actual exchange rates at maturity of the derivative.

The Company holds equity investments with readily determinable fair values and equity investments without readily determinable fair values. The Company has elected to measure equity investments that do not have readily determinable fair values at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer.
The following table is a summary of the activity related to equity investments:

Fair value is the exit price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability. Fair value is a market-based measurement determined using assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. In accordance with ASC 820, a three-level hierarchy was established to prioritize the inputs used in measuring fair value. The levels within the hierarchy are described below with Level 1 inputs having the highest priority and Level 3 inputs having the lowest.
The fair value of a derivative financial instrument (i.e., forward foreign exchange contracts, interest rate contracts) is the aggregation by currency of all future cash flows discounted to its present value at the prevailing market interest rates and subsequently converted to the U.S. Dollar at the current spot foreign exchange rate. The Company does not believe that fair values of these derivative instruments materially differ from the amounts that could be realized upon settlement or maturity, or that the changes in fair value will have a material effect on the Company’s results of operations, cash flows or financial position. The Company also holds equity investments which are classified as Level 1 and debt securities which are classified as Level 2. The Company holds acquisition related contingent liabilities based upon certain regulatory and commercial events, which are classified as Level 3, whose values are determined using discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques for which the determination of fair value requires significant judgment or estimations.
The following three levels of inputs are used to measure fair value:
Level 1 — Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.
Level 2 — Significant other observable inputs.
Level 3 — Significant unobservable inputs.

Held to maturity investments are reported at amortized cost and gains or losses are reported in earnings.
(2)
Available for sale debt securities are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported net of taxes in other comprehensive income.
As of the fiscal year ended December 29, 2024, the carrying amount of cash, cash equivalents and current marketable securities was approximately the same as the estimated fair value.
Fair value of government securities and obligations and corporate debt securities was estimated using quoted broker prices and significant other observable inputs.
The Company classifies all highly liquid investments with stated maturities of three months or less from date of purchase as cash equivalents and all highly liquid investments with stated maturities of greater than three months from the date of purchase as current marketable securities. Available for sale securities with stated maturities of greater than one year from the date of purchase are available to fund current operations and are classified as current marketable securities.

Income taxes
The worldwide effective income tax rates for the fiscal first quarter of 2025 and 2024 were
19.3
% and
12.4
%, respectively. The increase in the consolidated tax rate is primarily due to more income in higher tax jurisdictions, specifically in the U.S. In the fiscal first quarter of 2025 the Company reversed approximately $
7.0
billion, a significant portion of the previously accrued talc reserve versus a charge of $
2.7
billion recorded in the fiscal first quarter of 2024 for the talc settlement proposal. Both charges were recorded at an effective U.S. federal and state tax rate of approximately
22
% (for further information see Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).
As of March 30, 2025, the Company had approximately $
2.1
billion of liabilities from unrecognized tax benefits. The Company conducts business and files tax returns in numerous countries and currently has tax audits in progress in a number of jurisdictions. With respect to the United States, the Internal Revenue Service has completed its audit for the tax years through 2016 and has commenced the audit for tax years 2017 through 2020.
In other major jurisdictions where the Company conducts business, the years that remain open to tax audit go back to the year 2013. The Company believes it is possible that tax audits may be completed over the next twelve months by taxing authorities in some jurisdictions outside of the United States.

Legal proceedings
Johnson & Johnson and certain of its subsidiaries are involved in various lawsuits and claims regarding product liability; intellectual property; commercial; indemnification and other matters; governmental investigations; and other legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of their business.
The Company records accruals for loss contingencies associated with these legal matters when it is probable that a liability will be incurred, and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. As of March 30, 2025, the Company has determined that the liabilities associated with certain litigation matters are probable and can be reasonably estimated. The Company has accrued for these matters and will continue to monitor each related legal issue and adjust accruals as might be warranted based on new information and further developments in accordance with ASC 450-20-25. For these and other litigation and regulatory matters discussed below for which a loss is probable or reasonably possible, the Company is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss beyond the amounts accrued. Amounts accrued for legal contingencies often result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties that rely heavily on estimates and assumptions including timing of related payments. The ability to make such estimates and judgments can be affected by various factors including, among other things, whether damages sought in the proceedings are unsubstantiated or indeterminate; scientific and legal discovery has not commenced or is not complete; proceedings are in early stages; matters present legal uncertainties; there are significant facts in dispute; procedural or jurisdictional issues; the uncertainty and unpredictability of the number of potential claims; ability to achieve comprehensive multi-party settlements; complexity of related cross-claims and counterclaims; and/or there are numerous parties involved. To the extent adverse awards, judgments or verdicts have been rendered against the Company, the Company does not record an accrual until a loss is determined to be probable and can be reasonably estimated.
In the Company’s opinion, based on its examination of these matters, its experience to date and discussions with counsel, the ultimate outcome of legal proceedings, net of liabilities accrued in the Company’s balance sheet, is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position. However, the resolution of, or increase in accruals for, one or more of these matters in any reporting period may have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations and cash flows for that period.
Matters concerning talc
A significant number of personal injury claims alleging that talc causes cancer have been asserted against the Company and its affiliates arising out of the use of body powders containing talc, primarily JOHNSON’S Baby Powder.
In talc cases that have gone to trial, the Company has obtained a number of defense verdicts, but there also have been verdicts against the Company, many of which have been reversed on appeal. In June 2020, the Missouri Court of Appeals reversed in part and affirmed in part a July 2018 verdict of $
4.7
billion in Ingham v. Johnson & Johnson, et al., No. ED 207476 (Mo. App.), reducing the overall award to $
2.1
billion. An application for transfer of the case to the Missouri Supreme Court was subsequently denied, and in June 2021, a petition for certiorari, seeking a review of the Ingham decision by the United States Supreme Court, was denied. In June 2021, the Company paid the award, which, including interest, totaled approximately $
2.5
billion. The facts and circumstances, including the terms of the award, were unique to the Ingham decision and not representative of other claims brought against the Company. The Company continues to believe that it has strong legal grounds to contest the other talc verdicts that it has appealed. Notwithstanding the Company’s confidence in the safety of its talc products, in certain circumstances the Company has settled cases.
In June 2014, the Mississippi Attorney General filed a complaint against the Company alleging violation of the Mississippi Consumer Protection Act by failing to disclose alleged health risks associated with female consumers’ use of talc contained in JOHNSON’S Baby Powder and JOHNSON’S Shower to Shower (a product divested in 2012). The Company has reached an agreement to resolve this matter.
In January 2020, the State of New Mexico filed a consumer protection case alleging that the Company deceptively marketed and sold its talcum powder products by making misrepresentations about the safety of the products and the presence of carcinogens, including asbestos. The Company has reached an agreement to resolve this matter.
Forty-two states and the District of Columbia commenced a joint investigation into the Company’s marketing of its talcum powder products. In January 2024, the Company reached an agreement in principle with the multi-state group of state Attorneys General, subject to ongoing negotiation of non-monetary terms. In June 2024, the settlements were finalized.
In October 2021, Johnson & Johnson Consumer Inc. (Old JJCI) implemented a corporate restructuring (the 2021 Corporate Restructuring). As a result of that restructuring, Old JJCI ceased to exist and three new entities were created: (a) LTL Management LLC, a North Carolina limited liability company (LTL or Debtor); (b) Royalty A&M LLC, a North Carolina limited liability company and a direct subsidiary of LTL (RAM); and (c) the Debtor’s direct parent, Johnson & Johnson Consumer Inc., a New Jersey company (New JJCI). The Debtor received certain of Old JJCI’s assets and became solely responsible for the talc-related liabilities of Old
Tabl

JJCI, including all liabilities related in any way to injury or damage, or alleged injury or damage, sustained or incurred in the purchase or use of, or exposure to, talc, including talc contained in any product, or to the risk of, or responsibility for, any such damage or injury, except for any liabilities for which the exclusive remedy is provided under a workers’ compensation statute or act (the Talc-Related Liabilities).
In October 2021, notwithstanding the Company’s confidence in the safety of its talc products, the Debtor filed a voluntary petition with the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Western District of North Carolina, Charlotte Division, seeking relief under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code (the LTL Bankruptcy Case). All litigation against LTL, Old JJCI, New JJCI, the Company, other of their corporate affiliates, identified retailers, insurance companies, and certain other parties (the Protected Parties) was stayed. The LTL Bankruptcy Case was transferred to the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of New Jersey. Claimants filed motions to dismiss the LTL Bankruptcy Case and, following a multiple day hearing, the New Jersey Bankruptcy Court denied those motions in March 2022.
The claimants subsequently filed notices of appeal as to the denial of the motions to dismiss the LTL Bankruptcy Case and the extension of the stay to the Protected Parties. On January 30, 2023, the Third Circuit reversed the Bankruptcy Court’s ruling and remanded to the Bankruptcy Court to dismiss the LTL Bankruptcy Case.
In April 2023, the New Jersey Bankruptcy Court dismissed the LTL Bankruptcy Case, effectively lifting the stay as to all parties and returning the talc litigation to the tort system. LTL re-filed in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of New Jersey seeking relief under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code (the LTL 2 Bankruptcy Case). As a result of the new filing, all talc claims against LTL were again automatically stayed pursuant to section 362 of the Bankruptcy Code. Additionally, the New Jersey Bankruptcy Court issued a temporary restraining order staying all litigation as to LTL, Old JJCI, New JJCI, the Company, identified retailers, and certain other parties (the New Protected Parties).
Also in April 2023, the New Jersey Bankruptcy Court issued a decision that granted limited injunctive relief to the Company and the New Protected Parties (the LTL 2 Preliminary Injunction). The LTL 2 Preliminary Injunction remained in force until late August 2023, following the Bankruptcy Court’s extension of the initial LTL 2 Preliminary Injunction in June 2023. Under the LTL 2 Preliminary Injunction, except for those cases filed in the federal court ovarian cancer multi-district litigation, discovery in all personal injury and wrongful death matters was permitted to proceed.
Furthermore, in April 2023, the Talc Claimants' Committee filed a motion to dismiss the LTL 2 Bankruptcy Case followed by similar motions from other claimants. Hearings on the motions to dismiss occurred in June 2023. In July 2023, the court dismissed the LTL 2 Bankruptcy Case and, the same day, the Company stated its intent to appeal the decision and to continue its efforts to obtain a resolution of the talc claims. In September 2023, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order granting LTL leave to seek a direct appeal to the Third Circuit Court of Appeals. In October 2023, the Third Circuit granted LTL’s petition for a direct appeal. In July 2024, the Third Circuit issued a non-precedential opinion affirming the Bankruptcy Court's decision to dismiss the LTL 2 Bankruptcy Case.
In October 2023, the Company stated that it was pursuing the following four parallel and alternative pathways to achieve a comprehensive and final resolution of the talc claims: (i) the appeal of the LTL 2 dismissal decision; (ii) pursuing a consensual “prepackaged” bankruptcy case, as “strongly encouraged” by the Bankruptcy Court in its dismissal decision; (iii) aggressively litigating the talc claims in the tort system; and (iv) pursuing affirmative claims against experts for false and defamatory narratives regarding the Company’s talc powder products. In December 2023, LTL changed its state of formation to Texas and its name to LLT Management LLC (LLT).
Following the dismissal of the LTL 2 Bankruptcy Case, new lawsuits were filed, cases across the country that had been stayed were reactivated, and trials commenced. The majority of the cases are pending in federal court, organized in a multi-district litigation (MDL) in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey. In the MDL, case-specific discovery proceeded. The MDL proceedings were stayed by order of the bankruptcy court in the Red River Bankruptcy case discussed below. In March 2024, the court granted the Company's motion for a renewed Daubert hearing prior to the trial. The briefing on the renewed Daubert issues was completed in August 2024.
In May 2024, the Company commenced a
three-month
solicitation period of its proposed consensual “prepackaged” Chapter 11 bankruptcy plan (the Proposed Plan) for the comprehensive and final resolution of all current and future claims related to cosmetic talc in the United States, excluding claims related to mesothelioma or State consumer protection claims, in exchange for the payment by the Company of present value of approximately $
6.475
billion payable over
25
years (nominal value of approximately $
8.0
billion, discounted at a rate of
4.4
%). The claims encompassed by the Proposed Plan constitute
99.75
% of pending lawsuits against the Company relating to its talc powder products.
In August 2024, LLT engaged in a restructuring that resulted in the creation of three new Texas limited liability companies: (a) Red River Talc, LLC (Red River); (b) Pecos River Talc LLC (Pecos River); and (3) New Holdco (Texas) LLC. As a result of this restructuring, all claims related to ovarian and other gynecological cancers were separated and allocated to Red River, and mesothelioma, governmental unit and certain other claims were allocated to Pecos River.

In September 2024, while reiterating the Company's continued confidence in the safety of its talc products, Red River filed a voluntary petition with the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas, seeking relief under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code (the Red River Bankruptcy Case), in furtherance of the Company's consensual "prepackaged" Proposed Plan. Red River also filed a motion for a temporary restraining order, seeking to extend the automatic stay to additional non-debtor entities.
Shortly after Red River filed its Chapter 11 petition, the U.S. Trustee's office filed a motion to transfer venue in the New Jersey Bankruptcy Court, and thereafter, a motion to transfer venue and a motion to dismiss in the Texas Bankruptcy Court. A coalition of six plaintiff law firms also filed a motion to transfer venue and a motion to dismiss in the Texas Bankruptcy Court. In September 2024, the Texas Bankruptcy Court entered a temporary order enjoining the commencement or prosecution of all claims against Red River and certain non-debtor entities, including the Company, until October 11, 2024 (the Stay Order). The Stay Order was extended in October 2024, December 2024, and on March 13, 2025. Also in September 2024, the New Jersey Bankruptcy Court denied the U.S. Trustee's motion to transfer venue without prejudice. In October 2024, the Texas Bankruptcy Court denied the motion to transfer venue from Texas to New Jersey Bankruptcy Court. A consolidated hearing to address, among other things, the motions to dismiss and plan confirmation began on February 18, 2025 and concluded on February 28, 2025.
To account for the contemplated comprehensive resolution through the Proposed Plan, the Company recorded a cumulative incremental charge of approximately $
5.0
billion during fiscal year 2024. As of the end of fiscal year 2024, the total present value of the reserve was approximately $
11.6
billion (or nominal value of approximately $
13.5
billion). On March 31, 2025, the Texas Bankruptcy Court issued an order dismissing the case and, as a result, the Company reversed substantially all, or approximately $
7
billion, from amounts previously reserved for the bankruptcy resolution. Further, as a result of the dismissal, the Stay Order was dissolved. On April 1, 2025, the Company provided notice to the MDL court that the pending Daubert motion should proceed.
While the Company has resolved
95
% of the mesothelioma lawsuits filed to date, cases continue to be filed. Trials have commenced in various state courts. As of the first quarter 2025, the total present value of the reserve is approximately $
4.2
billion, comprising previously executed settlement arrangements, litigation defense and other costs. Approximately one-third of the reserve is recorded as a current liability.
In February 2019, the Company’s talc supplier, Imerys Talc America, Inc. and two of its affiliates, Imerys Talc Vermont, Inc. and Imerys Talc Canada, Inc. (collectively, Imerys) filed a voluntary petition for relief under Chapter 11 of the United States Code (the Bankruptcy Code) in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware (Imerys Bankruptcy). The Imerys Bankruptcy relates to Imerys’s potential liability for personal injury from exposure to talcum powder sold by Imerys. In its bankruptcy, Imerys alleges it has claims against the Company for indemnification and rights to joint insurance proceeds. In its bankruptcy, Imerys proposed a Chapter 11 plan (the Imerys Plan) that contemplated all talc-related claims against it being channeled to a trust along with its alleged indemnification rights against the Company. Following confirmation and consummation of the plan, the trust would pay talc claims pursuant to proposed trust distribution procedures (the TDP) and then seek indemnification from the Company.
In February 2021, Cyprus Mines Corporation (Cyprus), which had owned certain Imerys talc mines, filed a voluntary petition for relief under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code in the Delaware Bankruptcy Court and filed its Disclosure Statement and Plan (the Cyprus Plan). The Cyprus Plan contemplates a settlement with Imerys and talc claimants where Cyprus would make a monetary contribution to a trust established under the Imerys Plan in exchange for an injunction against talc claims asserted against it and certain affiliated parties. Cyprus also asserts it has claims for indemnity against the Company arising out of talc personal injury claims. Under the Cyprus Plan, Cyprus would also contribute its alleged indemnification rights to the trust.
In September 2023, Imerys and Cyprus filed amended plans of reorganization. The amended plans contemplate a similar construct as the prior Imerys and Cyprus Plans, including all talc claims against Imerys and Cyprus (and certain other protected parties) being channeled to a trust along with Imerys’s and Cyprus’s alleged indemnification rights against the Company. The Company opposed both plans on the basis that the plans inflated Imerys’s and Cyprus’s liability for talc claims and had the potential effect of imposing those inflated liabilities on the Company through the Company’s alleged indemnification obligations.
In July 2024, the Company, Imerys, and Cyprus and certain of their affiliates (including their parent entities), and the tort claimants' committees and future claimants' representatives appointed in the Imerys debtors' and Cyprus debtors' respective Chapter 11 cases entered into a global settlement agreement (the Imerys Settlement Agreement) to resolve the parties ongoing disputes, including disputes raised in the Imerys and Cyprus bankruptcies. Under the global settlement, the Company and its affiliates, on the one hand, and Imerys and Cyprus and their respective affiliates, on the other hand, release their claims against one another arising out of talc claims, including indemnification and contribution claims. In addition, under the settlement, the Company purchased the Imerys and Cyprus debtors' indemnification rights against the Company free and clear of all claims and interest (the Indemnity Buyback). In August 2024, Imerys and Cyprus filed amended Chapter 11 plans and disclosure statements incorporating the terms of the settlement with the Company. In October 2024, the Delaware Bankruptcy Court entered an order approving the Imerys Settlement Agreement (the Settlement Order). The effectiveness of certain provisions of the settlement, including the mutual
Tabl
e of Contents
releases, and Indemnity Buyback, were subject to certain conditions, which have since been satisfied. Accordingly, the mutual releases and Indemnity Buyback are now in effect.
Certain insurers have appealed the Settlement Order and sought a stay of the order pending appeal, which the Delaware Bankruptcy Court denied on January 13, 2025. The insurers then sought a stay of the order in the District Court for the District of Delaware, which also was denied. The insurers then appealed the denial of their request for a stay of the order to the Third Circuit Court of Appeals. The briefing of the Settlement Order appeal in the Delaware District Court is scheduled to be completed in April 2025.
On January 5, 2025, Imerys and Cyprus each filed a certification of voting results, indicating that their respective Chapter 11 plans had been accepted by each voting class of talc claimants. A joint confirmation hearing for the plans is scheduled for April 2025.
In February 2018, a securities class action lawsuit was filed against the Company and certain named officers in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey, alleging that the Company violated the federal securities laws by failing to disclose alleged asbestos contamination in body powders containing talc, primarily JOHNSON’S Baby Powder, and that purchasers of the Company’s shares suffered losses as a result. In April 2019, the Company moved to dismiss the complaint. In December 2019, the Court denied, in part, the motion to dismiss. The case was stayed in May 2022 pursuant to the LTL Bankruptcy Case and was reopened in May 2023. In December 2023, the Court granted Plaintiff’s motion for class certification. In January 2024, Defendants filed a petition with the Third Circuit under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(f) for permission to appeal the Court’s order granting class certification, and in February 2024, the Third Circuit granted Defendants' petition. In February 2024, fact discovery closed, the Court ordered the parties to mediate, and stayed the case pending mediation. In May 2024, the parties participated in an unsuccessful mediation. In June 2024, at the parties' request, the Court lifted the stay for certain limited discovery, but otherwise kept the stay in place pending a decision from the Third Circuit on the 23(f) petition. Briefing on the 23(f) petition was completed in September 2024, and in March 2025, the Third Circuit heard oral argument.
Matters concerning opioids
Beginning in 2014 and continuing to the present, the Company and Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (JPI), along with other pharmaceutical companies, have been named in close to
3,500
lawsuits related to the marketing of opioids, including DURAGESIC, NUCYNTA and NUCYNTA ER. Similar lawsuits have also been filed by private plaintiffs and organizations, including but not limited to the following: individual plaintiffs on behalf of children born with Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome (NAS); hospitals; and health insurers/payors.
To date, the Company and JPI have litigated two of the cases to judgment and have prevailed in both, either at trial or on appeal.
In July 2021, the Company announced finalization of an agreement to settle the state and subdivision claims for up to $
5.0
billion. Approximately
70
% of the all-in settlement was paid by the end of fiscal first quarter 2025. A few government entities opted out of the settlement. In September 2024, the Company reached an agreement to resolve the hospital cases.
The Company and JPI continue to defend the cases brought by the remaining government entity litigants as well as the cases brought by private litigants. In total, there are under
35
remaining opioid cases against the Company and JPI in various state courts,
325
remaining cases in the Ohio multi-district litigation (MDL), and
3
additional cases in other federal courts.
In addition, the Province of British Columbia filed suit against the Company and its Canadian affiliate Janssen Inc., and many other industry members, in Canada. That action was certified as an opt in class action on behalf of other provincial/territorial and the federal governments in Canada in January 2025. Additional proposed class actions have been filed in Canada against the Company and Janssen Inc., and many other industry members, by and on behalf of people who used opioids (for personal injuries), municipalities and First Nations bands. The proposed class action in Quebec on behalf of residents diagnosed with opioid use disorder was authorized to proceed against Janssen Inc. and other industry members in April 2024; and leave to appeal was denied in October 2024. The defendants including the Company filed appeals from the certification order in late February 2025.
Starting in November 2019, a series of shareholder derivative complaints were filed against the Company as the nominal defendant and certain current and former directors and officers as defendants in the Superior Court of New Jersey. The complaint alleges breaches of fiduciary duties related to the marketing of opioids, and that the Company has suffered damages as a result of those alleged breaches. As of September 2024, all the complaints had been dismissed, and all appeals exhausted.
Product liability
The Company and certain of its subsidiaries are involved in numerous product liability claims and lawsuits involving multiple products. Claimants in these cases seek substantial compensatory and, where available, punitive damages. While the Company believes it has substantial defenses, it is not feasible to predict the ultimate outcome of litigation. From time to time, even if it has substantial defenses, the Company considers isolated settlements based on a variety of circumstances. The Company has accrued
Tabl
e of Contents
for these matters and will continue to monitor each related legal issue and adjust accruals as might be warranted based on new information and further developments in accordance with ASC 450-20-25, Contingencies. The Company accrues an estimate of the legal defense costs needed to defend each matter when those costs are probable and can be reasonably estimated. For certain of these matters, the Company has accrued additional amounts such as estimated costs associated with settlements, damages and other losses. Product liability accruals can represent projected product liability for thousands of claims around the world, each in different litigation environments and with different fact patterns. Changes to the accruals may be required in the future as additional information becomes available.
The table below contains the most significant of these cases and provides the approximate number of plaintiffs in the United States with direct claims in pending lawsuits regarding injuries allegedly due to the relevant product or product category as of March 30, 2025:
The number of pending lawsuits is expected to fluctuate as certain lawsuits are settled or dismissed and additional lawsuits are filed. There may be additional claims that have not yet been filed.
MedTech
DePuy ASR XL Acetabular System and ASR Hip Resurfacing System
In August 2010, DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc. (DePuy) announced a worldwide voluntary recall of its ASR XL Acetabular System and DePuy ASR Hip Resurfacing System (ASR Hip) used in hip replacement surgery. Claims for personal injury have been made against DePuy and the Company. Cases filed in federal courts in the United States have been organized as a multi-district litigation in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio. Litigation has also been filed in countries outside of the United States, primarily in the United Kingdom, Ireland, India and Italy. In November 2013, DePuy reached an agreement with a Court-appointed committee of lawyers representing ASR Hip plaintiffs to establish a program to settle claims with eligible ASR Hip patients in the United States. This settlement program has resolved more than
10,000
claims, thereby bringing to resolution significant ASR Hip litigation activity in the United States. However, lawsuits in the United States remain, and the settlement program does not address litigation outside of the United States. The Company continues to receive information with respect to potential additional costs associated with this recall on a worldwide basis. The Company has established accruals for the costs associated with the United States settlement program and ASR Hip-related product liability litigation.
DePuy PINNACLE Acetabular Cup System
Claims for personal injury have also been made against DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc. and the Company (collectively, DePuy) relating to the PINNACLE Acetabular Cup System used in hip replacement surgery. Product liability lawsuits continue to be filed, and the Company continues to receive information with respect to potential costs and the anticipated number of cases. Most cases filed in federal courts in the United States have been organized as a multi-district litigation in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas (Texas MDL). Beginning on June 1, 2022, the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation ceased transfer of new cases into the Texas MDL, and there are now cases pending in federal court outside the Texas MDL. Litigation also has been filed in state courts and in countries outside of the United States. During the first quarter of 2019, DePuy established a United States settlement program to resolve these cases. As part of the settlement program, adverse verdicts have been settled. The Company has established an accrual for product liability litigation associated with the PINNACLE Acetabular Cup System and the related settlement program.
Ethicon Pelvic Mesh
Claims for personal injury have been made against Ethicon, Inc. (Ethicon) and the Company arising out of Ethicon’s pelvic mesh devices used to treat stress urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse. The Company continues to receive information with respect to potential costs and additional cases. Cases filed in federal courts in the United States had been organized as a multi-district litigation (MDL) in the United States District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia. In March 2021, the MDL Court entered an order closing the MDL. The MDL Court has remanded cases for trial to the jurisdictions where the case was originally
Tabl
e of Contents
filed and additional pelvic mesh lawsuits have been filed, and remain, outside of the MDL. The Company has settled or otherwise resolved the majority of the United States cases and the estimated costs associated with these settlements and the remaining cases are reflected in the Company’s accruals. In addition, class actions and individual personal injury cases or claims seeking damages for alleged injury resulting from Ethicon’s pelvic mesh devices have been commenced in various countries outside of the United States, including claims and cases in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and Ireland, and class actions in Israel, Australia, Canada and South Africa. The vast majority of these actions are now resolved. The Company has established accruals with respect to product liability litigation associated with Ethicon’s pelvic mesh products.
Ethicon Physiomesh
Following a June 2016 worldwide market withdrawal of Ethicon Physiomesh Flexible Composite Mesh (Physiomesh), claims for personal injury have been made against Ethicon, Inc. (Ethicon) and the Company alleging personal injury arising out of the use of this hernia mesh device. Cases filed in federal courts in the United States have been organized as a multi-district litigation (MDL) in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia. A multi-county litigation (MCL) also has been formed in New Jersey state court and assigned to Atlantic County for cases pending in New Jersey. In addition to the matters in the MDL and MCL, there are additional lawsuits pending in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio, which are part of the MDL for polypropylene mesh devices manufactured by C.R. Bard, Inc., and lawsuits pending in two New Jersey MCLs formed for Proceed/Proceed Ventral Patch and Prolene Hernia systems, and lawsuits pending outside the United States. In May 2021, Ethicon and lead counsel for the plaintiffs entered into a term sheet to resolve approximately
3,600
Physiomesh cases (covering approximately
4,300
plaintiffs) pending in the MDL and MCL at that time. A master settlement agreement (MSA) was entered into in September 2021 and includes
3,729
cases in the MDL and MCL. Other than a small number of cases still pending in the MDL, all Physiomesh matters in the United States have been resolved or are undergoing formal review for purposes of settlement.
Claims have also been filed against Ethicon and the Company alleging personal injuries arising from the PROCEED Mesh and PROCEED Ventral Patch hernia mesh products. In March 2019, the New Jersey Supreme Court entered an order consolidating these cases pending in New Jersey as an MCL in Atlantic County Superior Court. Additional cases have been filed in various federal and state courts in the United States, and in jurisdictions outside the United States.
Ethicon and the Company also have been subject to claims for personal injuries arising from the PROLENE Polypropylene Hernia System. In January 2020, the New Jersey Supreme Court created an MCL in Atlantic County Superior Court to handle such cases. Cases involving this product have also been filed in other federal and state courts in the United States.
In October 2022, an agreement in principle, subject to various conditions, was reached to settle the majority of the pending cases involving Proceed, Proceed Ventral Patch, Prolene Hernia System and related multi-layered mesh products, as well as a number of unfiled claims. All litigation activities in the two New Jersey MCLs are stayed pending effectuation of the proposed settlement. Future cases that are filed in the New Jersey MCLs will be subject to docket control orders requiring early expert reports and discovery requirements.
The Company has established accruals with respect to product liability litigation associated with Ethicon Physiomesh Flexible Composite Mesh, PROCEED Mesh and PROCEED Ventral Patch, and PROLENE Polypropylene Hernia System products.
Innovative Medicine
ELMIRON
Claims for personal injury have been made against a number of Johnson & Johnson companies, including Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and the Company, arising out of the use of ELMIRON, a prescription medication indicated for the relief of bladder pain or discomfort associated with interstitial cystitis. These lawsuits, which allege that ELMIRON contributes to the development of permanent retinal injury and vision loss, have been filed in both state and federal courts across the United States. In December 2020, lawsuits filed in federal courts in the United States, including putative class action cases seeking medical monitoring, were organized as a multi-district litigation in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey (MDL). In addition, cases have been filed in various state courts of New Jersey, which have been coordinated in a multi-county litigation in Bergen County, as well as the Court of Common Pleas in Philadelphia, which have been coordinated and granted mass tort designation. In addition, three class action lawsuits have been filed in Canada. The Company continues to defend ELMIRON product liability lawsuits and continues to evaluate potential costs related to those claims. All U.S. based ELMIRON matters have been resolved or are undergoing formal review for purposes of settlement. The Company has established accruals for defense and indemnity costs associated with ELMIRON related product liability litigation.
Intellectual property
Certain subsidiaries of the Company are subject, from time to time, to legal proceedings and claims related to patent, trademark and other intellectual property matters arising out of their businesses. Many of these matters involve challenges to the scope and/
Tabl
e of Contents
or validity of patents that relate to various products and allegations that certain of the Company’s products infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties. Although these subsidiaries believe that they have substantial defenses to these challenges and allegations with respect to all significant patents, there can be no assurance as to the outcome of these matters. A loss in any of these cases could adversely affect the ability of these subsidiaries to sell their products, result in loss of sales due to loss of market exclusivity, require the payment of past damages and future royalties, and may result in a non-cash impairment charge for any associated intangible asset.
Innovative Medicine - litigation against filers of abbreviated new drug applications (ANDAs)
The Company’s subsidiaries have brought lawsuits against generic companies that have filed ANDAs with the U.S. FDA (or similar lawsuits outside of the United States) seeking to market generic versions of products sold by various subsidiaries of the Company prior to expiration of the applicable patents covering those products. These lawsuits typically include allegations of non-infringement and/or invalidity of patents listed in FDA’s publication “Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations” (commonly known as the Orange Book). In each of these lawsuits, the Company’s subsidiaries are seeking an order enjoining the defendant from marketing a generic version of a product before the expiration of the relevant patents (Orange Book Listed Patents). In the event the Company’s subsidiaries are not successful in an action, or any automatic statutory stay expires before the court rulings are obtained, the generic companies involved would have the ability, upon regulatory approval, to introduce generic versions of their products to the market, resulting in the potential for substantial market share and revenue losses for the applicable products, and which may result in a non-cash impairment charge in any associated intangible asset. In addition, from time to time, the Company’s subsidiaries may settle these types of actions and such settlements can involve the introduction of generic versions of the products at issue to the market prior to the expiration of the relevant patents.
The Inter Partes Review (IPR) process with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), created under the 2011 America Invents Act, is also being used at times by generic companies in conjunction with ANDAs and lawsuits to challenge the applicable patents.
XARELTO
Beginning in March 2021, Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Bayer Pharma AG, Bayer AG and Bayer Intellectual Property GmbH filed patent infringement lawsuits in United States district courts against generic manufacturers who have filed ANDAs seeking approval to market generic versions of XARELTO before expiration of certain Orange Book Listed Patents. The following entities are named defendants: Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories, Inc.; Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories, Ltd.; Lupin Limited; Lupin Pharmaceuticals, Inc.; Taro Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd.; Taro Pharmaceuticals U.S.A., Inc.; Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc.; Mylan Pharmaceuticals Inc.; Mylan Inc.; Mankind Pharma Limited; Apotex Inc.; Apotex Corp.; Cipla Ltd.; Cipla USA Inc.; and InvaGen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. The following U.S. patents are included in one or more cases: 9,539,218 and 10,828,310.
U.S. Patent No. 10,828,310 was also under consideration by the USPTO in an IPR proceeding. In July 2023, the USPTO issued a final written decision finding the claims of the patent invalid. In September 2023, Bayer Pharma AG filed an appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. Oral argument is scheduled to be heard in May 2025.
INVEGA SUSTENNA
Beginning in January 2018, Janssen Pharmaceutica NV and Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. filed patent infringement lawsuits in United States district courts against generic manufacturers who have filed ANDAs seeking approval to market generic versions of INVEGA SUSTENNA before expiration of the Orange Book Listed Patent. The following entities are named defendants: Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc.; Mylan Laboratories Limited; Pharmascience Inc.; Mallinckrodt PLC; Specgx LLC; Tolmar, Inc.; Accord Healthcare, Inc.; Qilu Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd.; and Qilu Pharma Inc. The following U.S. patent is included in one or more cases: 9,439,906. In October 2020, the district court issued a decision in the case against Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc., finding that United States Patent No. 9,439,906 is not invalid. Teva previously stipulated to infringement. Teva appealed the decision, and, in April 2024, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit vacated and remanded the case to the district court for further proceedings. In November 2024, the district court issued its decision on remand, finding that United States Patent No. 9,439,906 is not invalid. Teva appealed to the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, and oral argument is scheduled for April 2025. In February 2024, the district court issued a decision in the case against Tolmar Inc. finding that United States Patent No. 9,439,906 is not invalid. Tolmar previously stipulated to infringement.

Oncology products achieved operational sales growth of 20.4% as compared to the same period a year ago. Strong sales of DARZALEX (daratumumab) were driven by continued share gains and market growth. Growth of ERLEADA (apalutamide) was due to continued share gains and market growth partially offset by the impact of Medicare Part D redesign (Part D). Increased sales of CARVYKTI (ciltacabtagene autoleucel) were driven by continued share gains and capacity expansion. Additionally, sales from the ongoing launches of TECVAYLI (teclistamab-cqyv), TALVEY (talquetamab-tgvs) and RYBREVANT (amivantamab)/LAZCLUZE (lazertinib) contributed to the growth. Growth was partially offset by ZYTIGA (abiraterone acetate) due to loss of exclusivity and IMBRUVICA (ibrutinib) declines due to competitive pressures and the impact of Part D.
Immunology products experienced an operational decline of 10.9% as compared to the same period a year ago primarily due to the  decline of STELARA (ustekinumab) sales driven by the impact of biosimilar competition and Part D. The growth of TREMFYA (guselkumab) was due to share gains and market growth partially offset by the impact of Part D. The SIMPONI/SIMPONI ARIA sales increase was primarily driven by the Merck, Sharp & Dohme return of rights in Europe in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2024. The REMICADE (infliximab) sales increase was due to a one-time favorable patient mix, market growth, and the Merck, Sharp & Dohme return of rights in Europe, partially offset biosimilar competition.
Sales of STELARA in the United States were approximately $6.7 billion in fiscal 2024. Third parties have filed abbreviated Biologics License Applications with the FDA seeking approval to market biosimilar versions of STELARA. The Company has settled certain litigation under the Biosimilar Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009. According to patent settlement and license agreements, the Company expects continued launches of biosimilar versions of STELARA in Europe and the United States in 2025 which will impact the Company’s sales of STELARA.
Neuroscience products experienced an operational decline of 7.0% as compared to the same period a year ago. The decline was driven by INVEGA SUSTENNA / XEPLION / INVEGA TRINZA / TREVICTA primarily due to the impact of Part D and Other Neuroscience primarily due to RISPERDAL/RISPERDAL CONSTA and the PONVORY divestiture. The decline was partially offset by the growth of SPRAVATO (esketamine) driven by the ongoing launch and increased physician and patient demand.
Pulmonary Hypertension products experienced an operational decline of 1.2% as compared to the same period a year ago. Sales growth of OPSUMIT (macitentan)/ OPSYNVI (macitentan/tadalafil) were driven by share gains and market growth partially offset by the impact of Part D redesign. The sales decline of UPTRAVI (selexipag) was driven by the impact of Part D partially offset by market growth.
Infectious disease products achieved operational sales growth of 0.1% as compared to the same period a year ago primarily driven by EDURANT/rilpivirine partially offset by declines across the portfolio including COVID-19 vaccine revenue in Other Infectious Diseases.
Cardiovascular / Metabolism / Other products achieved operational growth of 23.4% as compared to the same period a year ago. The growth of XARELTO (rivaroxaban) sales was primarily driven by one-time favorable patient mix and the impact of Part D.

The Surgery franchise achieved operational sales growth of 1.1% as compared to the prior year fiscal first quarter. The operational growth in Advanced Surgery was primarily due to the strength of the portfolio and recovery from U.S. supply challenges in Biosurgery as well as commercial execution in Biosurgery and Endocutters and strategic price actions in Endocutters. The growth was partially offset by competitive pressures in Energy and Endocutters as well as the negative impact of China volume-based procurement. The operational growth in General Surgery was primarily driven by technology penetration and upgrades within the differentiated Wound Closure portfolio and tender timing outside the U.S. The growth was partially offset by the impact from divestitures.
The Orthopaedics franchise experienced an operational sales decline of 3.1% as compared to the prior year fiscal first quarter. All platforms were impacted by one-time events: the lapping of the prior year one-time revenue recognition timing change related to certain products in the U.S., fewer selling days, and revenue disruption from the previously announced Orthopaedics restructuring. The operational decline in Hips reflects the aforementioned one-time events partially offset by the continued strength of the portfolio. The operational decline in Knees was driven by the aforementioned one-time events and tender timing outside the U.S. partially offset by procedure growth, strength of the ATTUNE portfolio and pull through related to the VELYS Robotic assisted solution. The operational growth in Trauma was primarily driven by the continued adoption of recently launched products, procedure growth, and commercial execution, partially offset by the aforementioned one-time events. The operational sales decline in Spine, Sports & Other reflects the aforementioned one-time events, competitive pressures, price pressures in the U.S. Early Interventional segment, and China volume-based procurement partially offset by growth in Shoulders.
The Cardiovascular franchise, which includes sales from Shockwave Medical (Shockwave) acquired on May 31, 2024, achieved operational sales growth of 17.7% as compared to the prior year fiscal first quarter.

The fiscal first quarter of 2025 includes the reversal of approximately $7.0 billion, a significant portion of the previously accrued talc reserve. The fiscal first quarter of 2024 includes charges for talc matters of $2.7 billion. For additional details related to talc refer to Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Innovative Medicine segment
The Innovative Medicine segment income before tax as a percent of sales in the fiscal first quarter of 2025 was 37.6% versus 36.6% for the same period a year ago. The increase in the income before tax as a percent of sales for the fiscal first quarter of 2025 as compared to the prior year was primarily driven by the following:
•
Lower restructuring related costs and amortization expense of $0.6 billion in 2025 versus $0.8 billion in 2024
•
Planned leverage and phasing of investments in Selling, Marketing and Administrative Expenses
•
Reduced spending and phasing of investments in Research & Development

MedTech segment
The MedTech segment income before tax as a percent of sales in the fiscal first quarter of 2025 was 17.7% versus 19.4% for the same period a year ago. The decrease in the income before tax as a percent of sales for the fiscal first quarter of 2025 as compared to the prior year was primarily driven by the following:
•
The fair value inventory step-up and amortization related to Shockwave of $0.1 billion in 2025
•
Increased investments in Research & Development associated with Shockwave and V-Wave
Restructuring
In the fiscal year 2023, the Company initiated a restructuring program of its Orthopaedics franchise within its MedTech segment to streamline operations by exiting certain markets, product lines and distribution network arrangements. The pre-tax restructuring expense was $55 million in the fiscal first quarter of 2025, of which $17 million was recorded in Restructuring, $8 million in Cost of products sold and $30 million in Other (Income)/Expense on the Consolidated Statement of Earnings primarily for costs related to asset impairments and market and product exits. The pre-tax restructuring expense was $27 million in the fiscal first quarter of 2024, of which $20 million was recorded in Restructuring and $7 million was recorded in Cost of products sold on the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. Total project costs of approximately $0.5 billion have been recorded since the restructuring was announced.

In the fiscal year 2023, the Company completed a prioritization of its research and development (R&D) investment within the Innovative Medicine segment to focus on the most promising medicines with the greatest benefit to patients. The pre-tax restructuring charge of approximately $0.1 billion in the fiscal first quarter of 2024 included the termination of partnered and non-partnered program costs and asset impairments. The program was completed in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2024.
For further details related to the restructuring refer to Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Provision for taxes on income
The worldwide effective income tax rate for the fiscal three months was 19.3% in 2025 and 12.4% in 2024.
On December 15, 2022, the European Union (EU) Member States formally adopted the EU’s Pillar Two Directive, which generally provides for a minimum effective tax rate of 15%, as established by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Pillar Two Framework that was supported by over 130 countries worldwide. Several EU and non-EU countries have enacted Pillar Two legislation with an initial effective date of January 1, 2024, with other aspects of the law effective in 2025 or later. While countries continue to enact new provisions or issue new regulations this could have an impact to the Company’s effective tax rate.

Cash flows
Cash and cash equivalents were $38.5 billion at the end of the fiscal first quarter of 2025 as compared with $24.1 billion at the end of fiscal year 2024. The primary sources and uses of cash that contributed to the $14.4 billion increase were:
In addition, the Company had $0.3 billion in marketable securities at the end of the fiscal first quarter of 2025 and $0.4 billion at the end of fiscal year 2024.

Cash flow from operations of $4.2 billion was the result of:
Cash flow used by investing activities of $0.3 billion was primarily from:
Cash flow from financing activities of $10.4 billion was primarily from:
The Company has access to substantial sources of funds at numerous banks worldwide and has the ability to issue up to $20 billion in Commercial Paper. Furthermore, in June 2024, the Company secured a new 364-day Credit Facility of $10 billion (expiration on June 25, 2025) which may be used for general corporate purposes including to support our commercial paper borrowings. Interest charged on borrowings under the credit line agreement is based on either Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) Reference Rate or other applicable market rate as allowed plus applicable margins. Commitment fees under the agreement are not material.
As of March 30, 2025, the Company had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of approximately $38.8 billion and had approximately $52.3 billion of notes payable and long-term debt for a net debt position of $13.5 billion as compared to the prior year fiscal first quarter net debt position of $7.4 billion. In the fiscal first quarter of 2025, the Company issued senior unsecured notes for approximately $9.2 billion. For additional details on borrowings, see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The net proceeds from this offering were used to fund the Intra-Cellular Therapies, Inc. acquisition for approximately $14.6 billion which closed subsequent to the quarter on April 2, 2025, and for general corporate purposes. The Company anticipates that operating cash flows, the ability to raise funds from external sources, borrowing capacity from existing committed credit facilities and access to the commercial paper markets will continue to provide sufficient resources to fund operating needs, including the Company’s remaining balance of approximately $4.2 billion related to talc matters and the remaining approximately $1.5 billion to settle opioid litigation (See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details). In addition, the Company monitors the global capital markets on an ongoing basis and from time to time may raise capital when market conditions are favorable.
Subsequent to March 30, 2025, the Company paid approximately $3.0 billion to the U.S. Treasury, including $2.5 billion related to the final installment due on foreign undistributed earnings as part of the TCJA charge (see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2024) and $0.5 billion primarily

related to the normal estimated payment for the fiscal first quarter of 2025. Additionally, the Company has paid $0.6 billion in income related taxes net of refunds in foreign jurisdictions in the first three months of fiscal 2025.

Economic and market factors
In July 2023, Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Janssen) filed litigation against the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services as well as the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services challenging the constitutionality of the IRA's Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Program. The litigation requests a declaration that the IRA violates Janssen’s rights under the First Amendment and the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution and therefore that Janssen is not subject to the IRA’s mandatory pricing scheme. The impact of the IRA on our business and the broader pharmaceutical industry remains uncertain, as litigation filed by Janssen and other pharmaceutical companies remains ongoing and while CMS has publicly announced the maximum fair price for each of the selected drugs, implementation of the program is still in progress. In April 2024, Janssen appealed the district court’s denial of its summary judgment motion to the Third Circuit.
Russia-Ukraine war
Although the long-term implications of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine are difficult to predict at this time, the financial impact of the conflict in the fiscal first quarter of 2025, including accounts receivable or inventory reserves, was not material. As of the fiscal three months ending March 30, 2025, and the fiscal year ending December 29, 2024, the business of the Company’s Russian subsidiaries represented less than 1% of the Company’s consolidated assets and represented approximately 1% of revenues. The Company does not maintain Ukrainian subsidiaries.
In March of 2022, the Company took steps to suspend all advertising, enrollment in clinical trials, and any additional investment in Russia. The Company continues to supply products relied upon by patients for healthcare purposes.
Conflict in the Middle East
Although the long-term implications of the conflict in the Middle East are difficult to predict at this time, the financial impact of the conflict in the fiscal first quarter of 2025, including accounts receivable or inventory reserves, was not material. As of the fiscal three months ending March 30, 2025, and the fiscal year ending December 29, 2024, the business of the Company’s Israel subsidiaries represented less than 1% of both Company’s consolidated assets and revenues.
Other Macroeconomic Considerations
The Company operates in certain countries where the economic conditions continue to present significant challenges. The Company continues to monitor these situations and take appropriate actions. Inflation rates and currency exchange rates continue to have an effect on worldwide economies and, consequently, on the way the Company operates. The Company has accounted for operations in Venezuela, Argentina, Turkey and Egypt (beginning in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2024) as highly inflationary, as the prior three-year cumulative inflation rate surpassed 100%. In the face of increasing costs, the Company strives to maintain its profit margins through cost reduction programs, productivity improvements and periodic price increases.
Governments around the world consider various proposals to make changes to tax laws, which may include increasing or decreasing existing statutory tax rates. In connection with various government initiatives, companies are required to disclose more information to tax authorities on operations around the world, which may lead to greater audit scrutiny of profits earned in other countries.

e of Contents
A change in statutory tax rate in any country would result in the revaluation of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities related to that particular jurisdiction in the period in which the new tax law is enacted. This change would result in an expense or benefit recorded to the Company’s Consolidated Statement of Earnings. The Company closely monitors these proposals as they arise in the countries where it operates. Changes to the statutory tax rate may occur at any time, and any related expense or benefit recorded may be material to the fiscal quarter and year in which the law change is enacted.
The Company may be further impacted by the imposition of tariffs, trade protection measures or other policies adopted by any jurisdiction that favor domestic companies and technologies over foreign competitors.
The Company faces various worldwide health care changes that may continue to result in pricing pressures that include health care cost containment and government legislation relating to sales, promotions and reimbursement of health care products.
Changes in the behavior and spending patterns of purchasers of healthcare products and services, including delaying medical procedures, rationing prescription medications, reducing the frequency of physician visits and foregoing healthcare insurance coverage, may continue to impact the Company’s businesses.
The Company faces regular intellectual property challenges from third parties, including generic and biosimilar manufacturers, seeking to manufacture and market generic and biosimilar versions of key pharmaceutical products prior to the expiration of the applicable patents. These challengers file Abbreviated New Drug Applications or abbreviated Biologics License Applications with the FDA or otherwise challenged the coverage and/or validity of the Company’s patents. In the event the Company is not successful in defending the patent claims challenged in the resulting lawsuits, generic or biosimilar versions of the products at issue may be introduced to the market, resulting in the potential for substantial market share and revenue losses for those products, and which may result in a non-cash impairment charge in any associated intangible asset. There is also risk that one or more competitors could launch a generic or biosimilar version of the product at issue following regulatory approval even though one or more valid patents are in place.
Item 3 — Quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk
There has been no material change in the Company’s assessment of its sensitivity to market risk since its presentation set forth in Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk,” in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2024.
Item 4 — Controls and procedures
Disclosure controls and procedures. At the end of the period covered by this report, the Company evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures. The Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Joaquin Duato, Chief Executive Officer; Chairman, Executive Committee and Joseph J. Wolk, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, reviewed and participated in this evaluation. Based on this evaluation, Messrs. Duato and Wolk concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective.
Internal control. During the period covered by this report, there were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. The Company continues to monitor and assess the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures.
The Company is implementing a multi-year, enterprise-wide initiative to integrate, simplify and standardize processes and systems for the human resources, information technology, procurement, supply chain and finance functions. These are enhancements to support the growth of the Company’s financial shared service capabilities and standardize financial systems. This initiative is not in response to any identified deficiency or weakness in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. In response to this initiative, the Company has and will continue to align and streamline the design and operation of its financial control environment.
