FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
This Form 10-Q includes “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.  Statements including words such as “believe”, “expect”, “anticipate”, “plan”, “desire”, “project”, “estimate”, “intend”, “will”, “should”, “could”, “would”, “may”, “strategy”, “potential”, “opportunity”, “outlook”, “scenario”, “guidance”, and similar expressions are forward-looking statements.  Forward-looking statements involve, among other things, expectations, projections, and assumptions about future financial and operating results, objectives (including objectives related to environmental and social matters), business outlook, priorities, sales growth, shareholder value, capital expenditures, cash flows, the housing market, the home improvement industry, demand for products and services including customer acceptance of new offerings and initiatives, macroeconomic conditions and consumer spending, share repurchases, and Lowe’s strategic initiatives, including those relating to acquisitions and dispositions and the impact of such transactions on our strategic and operational plans and financial results.  Such statements involve risks and uncertainties, and we can give no assurance that they will prove to be correct.  Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in such statements.
A wide variety of potential risks, uncertainties, and other factors could materially affect our ability to achieve the results either expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements including, but not limited to, the occurrence of any event or other circumstance that could give rise to the right of one or both of the parties to terminate the merger agreement between Lowe’s and ADG, the failure to obtain the requisite approvals or to satisfy the other conditions to the proposed merger on a timely basis or at all, the possibility that the anticipated benefits and synergies of the merger are not realized when expected, or at all, including as a result of the impact of, or problems arising from, the integration of the two companies or as a result of changes in general economic conditions, such as volatility and/or lack of liquidity from time to time in U.S. and world financial markets and the consequent reduced availability and/or higher cost of borrowing to Lowe’s and its customers, slower rates of growth in real disposable personal income that could affect the rate of growth in consumer spending, inflation and its impacts on discretionary spending and on our costs, shortages, and other disruptions in the labor supply, interest rate and currency fluctuations, home price appreciation or decreasing housing turnover, age of housing stock, the availability of consumer credit and of mortgage financing, trade policy changes or additional tariffs, outbreaks of pandemics, fluctuations in fuel and energy costs, inflation or deflation of commodity prices, natural disasters, geopolitical or armed conflicts, acts of both domestic and international terrorism, and other factors that can negatively affect our customers.
Investors and others should carefully consider the foregoing factors and other uncertainties, risks and potential events including, but not limited to, those described in “Item 1A - Risk Factors” and “Item 7 - Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and as may be updated from time to time in our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q or other subsequent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

Note 5:
Fair Value Measurements
Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.  The authoritative guidance for fair value measurements establishes a three-level hierarchy, which encourages an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value.  The three levels of the hierarchy are defined as follows:
•
Level 1
-
inputs to the valuation techniques that are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
•
Level 2
-
inputs to the valuation techniques that are other than quoted prices but are observable for the assets or liabilities, either directly or indirectly
•
Level 3
-
inputs to the valuation techniques that are unobservable for the assets or liabilities
Assets and Liabilities that are Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis
The following table presents the Company’s financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of May 2, 2025, May 3, 2024, and January 31, 2025:
There were no transfers between Levels 1, 2, or 3 during any of the periods presented.
When available, quoted prices were used to determine fair value.  When quoted prices in active markets were available, financial assets were classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.  When quoted prices in active markets were not available, fair values for financial assets and liabilities classified within Level 2 were determined using pricing models, and the
Table of Contents
inputs to those pricing models were based on observable market inputs.  The inputs to the pricing models were typically benchmark yields, reported trades, broker-dealer quotes, issuer spreads and benchmark securities, among others.
The Company has performance-based contingent consideration related to the fiscal 2022 sale of the Canadian retail business which is classified as a Level 3 long-term investment, and such contingent consideration had an estimated fair value of
zero
as of May 2, 2025, May 3, 2024, and January 31, 2025.  The Company’s measurements of fair value of the contingent consideration are based on an income approach, which requires certain assumptions considering operating performance of the business and a risk-adjusted discount rate.  Changes in the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration are recognized within selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A) in the consolidated statements of earnings.
Assets and Liabilities that are Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis
During the three months ended May 2, 2025, and May 3, 2024, the Company had no material measurements of assets and liabilities at fair value on a nonrecurring basis subsequent to their initial recognition.
Other Fair Value Disclosures
The Company’s financial assets and liabilities not measured at fair value on a recurring basis include cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, short-term borrowings, accounts payable, and long-term debt and are reflected in the financial statements at cost.  With the exception of long-term debt, cost approximates fair value for these items due to their short-term nature.  As further described in
Note 7
, certain long-term debt is associated with a fair value hedge and the changes in fair value of the hedged debt is included in the carrying value of long-term debt in the consolidated balance sheets.  The fair values of the Company’s unsecured notes were estimated using quoted market prices.  The fair values of the Company’s mortgage notes were estimated using discounted cash flow analyses, based on the future cash outflows associated with these arrangements and discounted using the applicable incremental borrowing rate.
Carrying amounts and the related estimated fair value of the Company’s long-term debt, excluding finance lease obligations, are as follows:
Note 6:
Accounts Payable
The Company has an agreement with a third party to provide a supplier finance program which facilitates participating suppliers’ ability to finance payment obligations from the Company with designated third-party financial institutions.  Participating suppliers may, at their sole discretion, make offers to finance one or more payment obligations of the Company prior to their scheduled due dates at a discounted price to participating financial institutions.
The Company’s outstanding payment obligations that suppliers financed to participating financial institutions, which are included in accounts payable on the consolidated balance sheets, are as follows:
Note 7:
Debt
The Company’s commercial paper program is supported by the $
2.0
billion
five-year
unsecured revolving credit agreement entered into in September 2023 (2023 Credit Agreement) and the $
2.0
billion
five-year
unsecured third amended and restated credit agreement entered into in December 2021, and as amended (Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement).  The amounts available to be drawn under the 2023 Credit Agreement and the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement are reduced by the amount of borrowings under the commercial paper program.  As of May 2, 2025, May 3, 2024, and January 31, 2025, there were
no
outstanding borrowings under the Company’s commercial paper program, the 2023 Credit Agreement, or
Table of Contents
the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement.  Total combined availability under the 2023 Credit Agreement and the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement was $
4.0
billion as of May 2, 2025.
Note 8:
Derivative Instruments
The Company utilizes fixed-to-floating interest rate swap agreements as fair value hedges on certain debt.
The notional amounts for the Company’s material derivative instruments are as follows:
See
Note 5
for the gross fair values of the Company’s outstanding derivative financial instruments and corresponding fair value classifications.  The cash flows related to settlement of the Company’s hedging derivative financial instruments are classified in the consolidated statements of cash flows based on the nature of the underlying hedged items.
The Company accounts for the fixed-to-floating interest rate swap agreements as fair value hedges using the shortcut method of accounting under which the hedges are assumed to be perfectly effective.  Thus, the change in fair value of the derivative instruments offsets the change in fair value on the hedged debt, and there is no net impact in the consolidated statements of earnings from the fair value of the derivatives.
Note 9:
Shareholders’ Deficit
The Company has a share repurchase program that is executed through purchases made from time to time either in the open market, which may be made under pre-set trading plans meeting the requirements of Rule 10b5-1(c) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or through private off-market transactions.  Shares purchased under the repurchase program are returned to authorized and unissued status.  Any excess of cost over par value is charged to additional paid-in capital to the extent that a balance is present.  Once additional paid-in capital is fully depleted, remaining excess of cost over par value is charged to accumulated deficit.  As of May 2, 2025, the Company had $
10.8
billion remaining in its share repurchase program.
The Company also withholds shares from employees to satisfy either the exercise price of stock options exercised or the statutory withholding tax liability resulting from the vesting of share-based awards.
Total shares repurchased for the three months ended May 2, 2025, and May 3, 2024, were as follows:

Includes excise tax on share repurchases in excess of issuances as part of the cost basis of the shares acquired.

Segment Information
The Company’s home improvement operations represent a single operating segment designed to enable customers to purchase products and services seamlessly through all channels.  The Company’s chief operating decision maker (CODM) is the Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer.  The CODM has the ultimate decision-making authority for resource allocation and assessing the performance of the Company.  Thereby, the CODM regularly reviews consolidated net earnings as the measure of segment profit or loss, as well as significant segment expenses included in the below table, to evaluate operating performance, generate future operating plans and make strategic decisions regarding the allocation of capital.  The CODM also uses these measures in monitoring plan versus actual results.  The CODM does not review segment assets at a different asset level or category than those disclosed in the consolidated balance sheets.

Results of Review of Interim Financial Information
We have reviewed the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets of Lowe’s Companies, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of May 2, 2025 and May 3, 2024, the related condensed consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income, shareholders’ deficit, and cash flows, for the fiscal three-month periods ended May 2, 2025 and May 3, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “interim financial information”). Based on our reviews, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the accompanying interim financial information for it to be in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
We have previously audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheet of the Company as of January 31, 2025, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income, shareholders’ deficit, and cash flows for the fiscal year then ended (not presented herein); and in our report dated March 24, 2025, we expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. In our opinion, the information set forth in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet as of January 31, 2025, is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the consolidated balance sheet from which it has been derived.
Basis for Review Results
This interim financial information is the responsibility of the Company’s management. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our reviews in accordance with standards of the PCAOB. A review of interim financial information consists principally of applying analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB, the objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
This discussion and analysis summarizes the significant factors affecting our consolidated operating results, liquidity and capital resources during the three months ended May 2, 2025, and May 3, 2024.  This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes to the consolidated financial statements that are included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2025 (the Annual Report), as well as the consolidated financial statements (unaudited) and notes to the consolidated financial statements (unaudited) contained in this report.  Unless otherwise specified, all comparisons made are to the corresponding period of fiscal 2024.  This discussion and analysis is presented in four sections:

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW
The following table highlights our financial results:
1
Repurchases of common stock on a trade-date basis.
Net sales in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 declined 2.0% to $20.9 billion compared to net sales of $21.4 billion in the first quarter of fiscal 2024.  Comparable sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 decreased 1.7%, consisting of a 3.8% decrease in comparable customer transactions, partially offset by a 2.1% increase in comparable average ticket.  Net earnings in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 were $1.6 billion, compared to net earnings of $1.8 billion in the first quarter of fiscal 2024.  Diluted earnings per common share were $2.92 in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 compared to $3.06 in the first quarter of fiscal 2024.
For the first three months of fiscal 2025, cash flows from operating activities were approximately $3.4 billion, with $518 million used for capital expenditures.  Continuing to deliver on our commitment to return excess cash to shareholders, during the three months ended May 2, 2025, we paid $645 million in dividends.
The Company faced ongoing challenges in the housing market and pressure in DIY big ticket discretionary demand during the first quarter of fiscal 2025.  In addition, unfavorable weather early in the quarter led to a slower start to spring.  Despite these challenges, our Pro and online sales continued to grow which reflects the results of our investments in our Total Home strategy.
During the first quarter, we re-launched our Pro customer loyalty program, which is now My Lowe’s Pro Rewards.  The updated program is more intuitive to use which we expect will lead to greater utilization.  In addition, our technology transformation has made our gains in online possible through an improved user experience and enhanced visualization tools.  We also launched Mylow this quarter, the first Artificial Intelligence (AI)-powered home improvement virtual advisor that provides step-by-step instructions for any project, and then helps customers find and purchase the right tools and materials needed for their project directly on lowes.com or the Lowe’s mobile app.
Overall, we delivered solid results in the first quarter through disciplined execution and our continued focus on elevating the customer experience.  While we continue to monitor the trade policy environment and execute our mitigation efforts, we
Table of Contents
believe we are making the right investments in leading technology solutions, while focusing on our Total Home strategy, to drive sustainable growth and meaningful long-term shareholder value.
OPERATIONS
The following table sets forth the percentage relationship to net sales of each line item of the consolidated statements of earnings (unaudited), as well as the percentage change in dollar amounts from the prior period.  This table should be read in conjunction with the following discussion and analysis and the consolidated financial statements (unaudited), including the related notes to the consolidated financial statements (unaudited).
The following table sets forth key metrics utilized by management in assessing business performance.  This table should be read in conjunction with the following discussion and analysis and the consolidated financial statements (unaudited), including the related notes to the consolidated financial statements (unaudited).
1
A comparable location is defined as a retail location that has been open longer than 13 months.
A location that is identified for relocation is no longer considered comparable in the month of its relocation.
The relocated location must then remain open longer than 13 months to be considered comparable.
A location we decide to close is no longer considered comparable as of the beginning of the month in which we announce its closing.  Operating locations which are sold are included in comparable sales until the date of sale.  Comparable sales are presented on a transacted basis when tender is accepted from a customer.  Comparable sales include online sales, which positively impacted first quarter fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2024 comparable sales by approximately 65 basis points and 10 basis points, respectively.  The comparable store sales calculation included in the preceding table was calculated using comparable 13-week periods.
2
In the first quarter of fiscal 2025, the Company adjusted its customer transactions metric to exclude certain order modifications which were previously included as a separate transaction.  The prior year period has been adjusted to align with the current period presentation.
3
Average ticket is defined as net sales divided by the total number of customer transactions.
Table of Contents
4
Average store size selling square feet is defined as sales floor square feet divided by the number of stores open at the end of the period.
5
Return on invested capital is calculated using a non-GAAP financial measure.  See below for additional information and reconciliations of non-GAAP measures.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Return on Invested Capital
Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) is calculated using a non-GAAP financial measure.  Management believes ROIC is a meaningful metric for analysts and investors as a measure of how effectively the Company is using capital to generate financial returns.  Although ROIC is a common financial metric, numerous methods exist for calculating ROIC.  Accordingly, the method used by our management may differ from the methods used by other companies.  We encourage you to understand the methods used by another company to calculate ROIC before comparing its ROIC to ours.
We define ROIC as the rolling 12 months’ lease adjusted net operating profit after tax (Lease adjusted NOPAT) divided by the average of current year and prior year ending debt and shareholders’ deficit.  Lease adjusted NOPAT is a non-GAAP financial measure, and net earnings is considered to be the most comparable GAAP financial measure.  The calculation of ROIC, together with a reconciliation of net earnings to Lease adjusted NOPAT, is as follows:
1
Income tax adjustment is defined as lease adjusted net operating profit multiplied by the effective tax rate, which was 24.0% and 24.3% for the periods ended May 2, 2025, and May 3, 2024, respectively.
2
Average debt and shareholders’ deficit is defined as average current year and prior year ending debt, including current maturities, short-term borrowings, and operating lease liabilities, plus the average current year and prior year ending total shareholders’ deficit.
Results of Operations
Net Sales –
Net sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 decreased 2.0% to $20.9 billion.  Comparable sales declined 1.7% consisting of a 3.8% decrease in comparable customer transactions, partially offset by a 2.1% increase in comparable average ticket.
During the first quarter of fiscal 2025, we experienced comparable sales increases in three of 14 product categories: Building Materials, Appliances, and Rough Plumbing.  Growth in Building Materials and Rough Plumbing reflect strong demand with the Pro customer, demonstrating improvement from our investments in our Pro product and service offerings.
Gross Margin –
For the first quarter of fiscal 2025, gross margin increased 19 basis points as a percentage of sales.  The gross margin improvement for the quarter is primarily driven by ongoing productivity initiatives and improvement in shrink and credit revenue.
Table of Contents
SG&A –
For the first quarter of fiscal 2025, SG&A expense deleveraged 56 basis points as a percentage of sales compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2024 due primarily to lower sales volume, incremental wage actions and higher health care costs.
Depreciation and Amortization –
Depreciation and amortization deleveraged 13 basis points for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 compared to the prior year.
Interest – Net
– Interest expense for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 leveraged four basis points as a percentage of sales.
Income Tax Provision –
Our effective income tax rates were 23.9% and 23.7% for the three months ended May 2, 2025 and May 3, 2024, respectively.
FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
Sources of Liquidity
Cash flows from operations, combined with our continued access to capital markets on both a short-term and long-term basis, as needed, remain adequate to fund our operations, make strategic investments to support long-term growth, return excess cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases, and repay debt maturities as they become due.  We believe these sources of liquidity will continue to support our business for the next twelve months.  As of May 2, 2025, we held $3.1 billion of cash and cash equivalents, as well as $4.0 billion in undrawn capacity on our revolving credit facilities.
Cash Flows Provided by Operating Activities
Cash flows from operating activities continued to provide the primary source of our liquidity.  The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities for the three months ended May 2, 2025, compared to the three months ended May 3, 2024, was primarily driven by changes in working capital and lower net earnings.  Cash flows relating to changes in accounts payable were unfavorable $1.1 billion primarily due to timing of purchases and an earlier spring inventory build for the current year.
Cash Flows Used in Investing Activities
Net cash used in investing activities primarily consists of transactions related to capital expenditures.  Our capital expenditures generally consist of investments in our strategic initiatives to enhance our ability to serve customers, improve existing stores, and support expansion plans.  Capital expenditures were $518 million and $382 million for the three months ended May 2, 2025, and May 3, 2024, respectively.  For fiscal 2025, our guidance for capital expenditures is approximately $2.5 billion.
Cash Flows Used in Financing Activities
Net cash used in financing activities primarily consists of transactions related to our debt, share repurchases, and cash dividend payments.
Debt
Our commercial paper program is supported by the 2023 Credit Agreement and the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement.  The amounts available to be drawn under the 2023 Credit Agreement and the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement are reduced by the amount of borrowings under our commercial paper program.  There were no outstanding borrowings under our commercial paper program, 2023 Credit Agreement, or the Third Amended and Restated Credit
Table of Contents
Agreement as of May 2, 2025.  Total combined availability under the 2023 Credit Agreement and the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement as of May 2, 2025 was $4.0 billion.
The 2023 Credit Agreement and the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement contain customary representations, warranties, and covenants.  We were in compliance with those covenants at May 2, 2025.
The following table includes additional information related to our debt for the three months ended May 2, 2025, and May 3, 2024:
Share Repurchases
We have an ongoing share repurchase program, authorized by the Company’s Board of Directors, that is executed through purchases made from time to time either in the open market or through private off-market transactions.  We also withhold shares from employees to satisfy tax withholding liabilities.  Shares repurchased are retired and returned to authorized and unissued status.  The following table provides, on a settlement date basis, the total number of shares repurchased, average price paid per share, and the total cash used to repurchase shares for the three months ended May 2, 2025, and May 3, 2024:
1
Excludes unsettled share repurchases and unpaid excise taxes.
As of May 2, 2025, we had $10.8 billion remaining available under our share repurchase program with no expiration date.  The Company determines the timing and amount of repurchases based on its assessment of various factors including prevailing market conditions, alternate uses of capital, liquidity, and the economic environment, among others. The timing and amount of these share repurchases are subject to change at any time.
Dividends
Dividends are paid in the quarter immediately following the quarter in which they are declared.  Dividends paid per share increased from $1.10 per share for the three months ended May 3, 2024, to $1.15 per share for the three months ended May 2, 2025.
Capital Resources
We expect to continue to have access to the capital markets on both a short-term and long-term basis when needed for liquidity purposes by issuing commercial paper or new long-term debt.  The availability and the borrowing costs of these funds could be adversely affected, however, by a downgrade of our debt ratings or a deterioration of certain financial ratios.  The table below reflects our debt ratings by Standard & Poor’s (S&P) and Moody’s as of May 29, 2025, which we are disclosing to enhance understanding of our sources of liquidity and the effect of our ratings on our cost of funds.  Our debt ratings have given, and should continue to give, us the option to refinance our debt as it becomes due.  Our commercial paper and senior debt ratings may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization, and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.
Table of Contents
There are no provisions in any agreements that would require early cash settlement of existing debt or leases as a result of a downgrade in our debt rating or a decrease in our stock price.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES
Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements presented in the Annual Report.  Our critical accounting policies and estimates are described in “Item 7 - Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in the Annual Report.  Our significant and critical accounting policies and estimates have not changed significantly since the filing of the Annual Report.
Item 3. - Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk
The Company is exposed to certain market risks, including changes in interest rates and commodity prices.  The Company’s market risks have not changed materially from those disclosed in the Annual Report for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2025.
Item 4. - Controls and Procedures
The Company’s management, with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the Company’s “disclosure controls and procedures,” (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act)).  Based upon their evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of May 2, 2025, the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective for the purpose of ensuring that the information required to be disclosed in the reports that the Company files or submits under the Exchange Act with the SEC (1) is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and (2) is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
The Company is undergoing a multi-year technology transformation which includes updating and modernizing our merchandise selling system, as well as certain accounting and finance systems. These updates are expected to continue for the next few years, and management will continue to evaluate the design and implementation of the Company’s internal controls over financial reporting as the transformation continues.  No change in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting occurred during the quarter ended May 2, 2025, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.
