NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)
NOTE A – BASIS OF PRESENTATION
The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements of Boston Scientific Corporation have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP) and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X, and they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. When used in this report, the terms, "we," "us," "our," and "the Company" mean Boston Scientific Corporation and its divisions and subsidiaries. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments) considered necessary for fair presentation have been included. Operating results for the three months ended March 31, 2025 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2025. Accordingly, our unaudited consolidated financial statements and footnotes thereto should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and footnotes thereto included in Item 8 of our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K.
The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company's wholly owned- subsidiaries and entities for which we have a controlling financial interest. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. We consolidate our majority stake investment in Acotec Scientific Holdings Limited on a one quarter lag.
Amounts reported in millions within this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are computed based on the amounts in thousands. As a result, the sum of the components may not equal the total amount reported in millions due to rounding. Certain columns and rows within tables may not add due to the use of rounded numbers. Percentages presented are calculated from the underlying unrounded amounts.
Subsequent Events
We evaluate events occurring after the date of our accompanying unaudited consolidated balance sheets for potential recognition or disclosure in our unaudited consolidated financial statements. Those items requiring recognition in the financial statements have been recorded and disclosed accordingly.
Those items requiring disclosure (non-recognized subsequent events) in the financial statements have been disclosed accordingly. Refer to
Note B – Acquisitions and Strategic Investments
for further details.
NOTE B – ACQUISITIONS AND STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS
Our accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements include the operating results for acquired entities from the respective dates of acquisition. We have not presented supplemental pro forma financial information for completed acquisitions or divestitures given their results are not material to our accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements. Further, transaction costs were immaterial to our accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements and were expensed as incurred.
On April 1, 2025, we completed our acquisition of the remaining shares of Bolt Medical, Inc. (Bolt Medical), the developer of an intravascular lithotripsy advanced laser-based platform for the treatment of coronary and peripheral artery disease. We had been an investor in Bolt Medical since 2019 and held an equity stake of approximately
26
percent immediately prior to the acquisition date. The transaction price to acquire the remaining stake consisted of an upfront cash payment of approximately $
516
million upon closing and up to an additional $
148
million in a future payment upon achievement of a regulatory milestone. The Bolt Medical business will be integrated into our Cardiology and Peripheral Interventions divisions.
On March 3, 2025, we announced our entry into a definitive agreement to acquire SoniVie Ltd. (SoniVie), a privately held medical device company that has developed the TIVUS™ Intravascular Ultrasound System. An investigational technology, the TIVUS system is designed to denervate nerves surrounding blood vessels to treat a variety of hypertensive disorders, including renal artery denervation for hypertension. We have been an investor in SoniVie since 2022 and currently hold an equity stake of approximately
10
percent. The transaction price to acquire the remaining stake is expected to result in an upfront cash payment of approximately $
360
million upon closing and up to an additional $
180
million in a future payment upon achievement of a regulatory milestone. The transaction is expected to close during the second quarter of 2025, subject to customary closing conditions. The SoniVie business will be integrated into our Cardiology division.

Table of Contents
On November 25, 2024, we announced our entry into a definitive agreement to acquire
100
percent of Intera Oncology®, Inc. (Intera), a privately held medical device company that provides the Intera 3000 Hepatic Artery Infusion Pump and floxuridine – a chemotherapy drug – both of which are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The Intera 3000 pump is used to administer hepatic artery infusion therapy to treat tumors in the liver primarily caused by metastatic colorectal cancer. The purchase price consists of an upfront cash payment of approximately $
175
million. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2025, subject to customary closing conditions. The Intera business will be integrated into our Peripheral Interventions division.
2025 Acquisitions
On January 24, 2025, we completed our acquisition of
100
percent of Cortex, Inc. (Cortex), a privately held medical technology company focused on the development of a diagnostic mapping solution which may identify triggers and drivers outside of the pulmonary veins that are foundational to atrial fibrillation (AF). The transaction consisted of an upfront cash payment of $
239
million, net of cash acquired, and up to an additional $
50
million in future payments upon achievement of clinical and other milestones. The Cortex business will be integrated into our Cardiology division.
Purchase Price Allocation
We accounted for this transaction as a business combination in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 805,
Business Combinations
(FASB ASC Topic 805).
The preliminary purchase price was comprised of the amount presented below:
We recorded the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their respective fair values as of the closing date of the transaction. The preliminary purchase price allocation was comprised of the components presented below, which represent the preliminary determination of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net identifiable assets acquired recorded to goodwill.
The final determination of the fair value of certain assets and liabilities will be completed within the measurement period in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 805.
Goodwill was primarily established due to synergies expected to be gained from leveraging our existing operations, as well as revenue and cash flow projections associated with future technologies, none of which is deductible for tax purposes.
We allocated a portion of the purchase price to the specific intangible asset categories as follows:
10
Table of Contents
Our technology-related intangible assets consist of technical processes, intellectual property and institutional understanding with respect to products and processes that we intend to leverage in future products or processes. We used the multi-period excess earnings method, a form of the income approach, to derive the fair value of the technology-related intangible assets and are amortizing them on a straight-line basis over their assigned estimated useful lives.
Contingent Consideration
Changes in the fair value of our contingent consideration liability during the first quarter of 2025 associated with prior period acquisitions were as follows:
There were no payments made during the first quarter of 2025. The maximum amount we could be required to pay for certain contingent consideration is not determinable as it is uncapped and based on a percent of certain sales. As of March 31, 2025, the fair value of such uncapped contingent consideration is estimated at $
151
million. As of March 31, 2025, the maximum amount that we could be required to pay under our other capped contingent consideration arrangements (undiscounted) is approximately $
270
million. Refer to
Note B – Acquisitions and Strategic Investments
to our audited financial statements contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.
The recurring Level 3 fair value measurements of our contingent consideration liability that we expect to be required to settle include the following significant unobservable inputs:
(1)
Unobservable inputs were weighted by the relative fair value of the contingent consideration liability. For projected year of payment, the amount represents the median of the inputs and is not a weighted average.
Projected contingent payment amounts related to our clinical and revenue-based payments and commercialization milestones are discounted back to the current period, primarily using a discounted cash flow model. Significant increases or decreases in projected revenues, probabilities of payment, discount rates or the time until payment is made would have resulted in a significantly lower or higher fair value measurement as of March 31, 2025.
Strategic Investments
The aggregate carrying amount of our strategic investments was comprised of the following:
(1)
Measurement alternative investments are privately-held equity securities without readily determinable fair values that are measured at cost less impairment, if any, adjusted to fair value for any observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer, recognized in
Other, net
within our accompanying unaudited consolidated statements of operations.

Table of Contents
(2)
Includes publicly-held equity securities measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in
Other, net
within our accompanying unaudited consolidated statements of operations.
These investments are classified as
Other long-term assets
within our accompanying unaudited consolidated balance sheets, in accordance with GAAP and our accounting policies.
As of March 31, 2025, the cost of our aggregated equity method investments exceeded our share of the underlying equity in net assets by $
374
million, which represents amortizable intangible assets, in-process research and development (IPR&D), goodwill and deferred tax liabilities.
NOTE C – GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS
The gross carrying amount of goodwill and other intangible assets and the related accumulated amortization for intangible assets subject to amortization and accumulated goodwill impairment charges are as follows:
The increase in our balance of goodwill is related primarily to our acquisition of Cortex in the first quarter of 2025.
The following represents a roll forward of our goodwill balance by reportable segment:
Goodwill and Other Intangible Asset Impairments
We did
not
record any goodwill or other intangible asset impairment charges in the first quarter of 2025 or 2024. We test our goodwill balances in the second quarter of each year as of April 1 for impairment, or more frequently if impairment indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest an impairment may exist. Refer to
Note A – Significant Accounting Policies
to our audited financial statements contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of our annual goodwill and intangible asset impairment testing.

NOTE D – HEDGING ACTIVITIES AND FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities
We address market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates through risk management programs which include the use of derivative and nonderivative financial instruments. We operate these programs pursuant to documented corporate risk management policies and do not enter into derivative transactions for speculative purposes. Our derivative instruments do not subject our earnings to material risk, as the gains or losses on these derivatives generally offset losses or gains recognized on the hedged item.
We manage concentration of counterparty credit risk by limiting acceptable counterparties to major financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings, limiting the amount of credit exposure to individual counterparties and by actively monitoring counterparty credit ratings and the amount of individual credit exposure. We also employ master netting arrangements that limit the risk of counterparty non-payment on a particular settlement date to the net gain that would have otherwise been received from the counterparty. Although not completely eliminated, we do not consider the risk of counterparty default to be significant as a result of these protections. Further, none of our derivative instruments are subject to collateral or other security arrangements, nor do they contain provisions that are dependent on our credit ratings from any credit rating agency.
Currency Hedging Instruments
Risk Management Strategy
Our risk from changes in currency exchange rates consists primarily of monetary assets and liabilities; forecasted intercompany and third-party transactions; and net investments in certain subsidiaries. We manage currency exchange rate risk at a consolidated level to reduce the cost of hedging by taking advantage of offsetting transactions. We employ derivative and nonderivative instruments, primarily forward currency contracts, to reduce the risk to our earnings and cash flows associated with changes in currency exchange rates.
The success of our currency risk management program depends, in part, on forecasted transactions denominated primarily in euro, Chinese renminbi, Japanese yen, British pound sterling, Australian dollar and Swiss franc. We may experience unanticipated currency exchange gains or losses to the extent the actual activity is different than forecasted. In addition, changes in currency exchange rates related to any unhedged transactions may impact our earnings and cash flows.
Hedge Designations and Relationships
Certain of our currency derivative instruments are designated as cash flow hedges under FASB ASC Topic 815
, Derivatives and Hedging
(FASB ASC Topic 815), and are intended to protect the U.S. dollar value of forecasted transactions. The gain or loss on a derivative instrument designated as a cash flow hedge is recorded in the
Net change in derivative financial instruments
component of
Other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax
(OCI)
within our unaudited consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss) until the underlying third-party transaction occurs. When the underlying third-party transaction occurs, we recognize the gain or loss in earnings within
Cost of products sold
within our unaudited consolidated statements of operations. In the event the hedging relationship is no longer effective, or if the occurrence of the hedged forecast transaction becomes no longer probable, we reclassify the gains or losses within
Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax
(AOCI) to earnings at that time. The cash flows related to the derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges are reported as operating activities within our unaudited consolidated statements of cash flows.
We also designate certain forward currency contracts as net investment hedges to hedge a portion of our net investments in certain of our entities with functional currencies denominated in euro, Chinese renminbi and Japanese yen. For these derivative instruments, we elected to use the spot method to assess hedge effectiveness. We also elected to exclude the spot-forward difference, referred to as the excluded component, from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and are amortizing this amount separately, as calculated at the date of designation, on a straight-line basis over the term of the currency forward contracts. As such, we defer recognition of foreign currency gains and losses within the
Foreign currency translation adjustment
(CTA) component of OCI, and we reclassify amortization of the excluded component from AOCI to current period earnings within
Interest expense
within our unaudited consolidated statements of operations.
We designate certain euro-denominated debt as net investment hedges to hedge a portion of our net investments in certain of our entities with functional currencies denominated in euro. As of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, we designated as a net investment hedge our €
900
million in aggregate principal amount of
0.625
% senior notes issued in November 2019 and due in 2027 (December 2027 Notes). For these nonderivative instruments, we defer recognition of the foreign currency
13
Table of Contents
remeasurement gains and losses within the
CTA component of OCI. We reclassify these gains and losses to current period earnings within
Other, net
within our accompanying unaudited consolidated statements of operations only when the hedged item affects earnings, which would occur upon disposal or substantial liquidation of the underlying foreign subsidiary.
We also use forward currency contracts that are not part of designated hedging relationships as a part of our strategy to manage our exposure to currency exchange rate risk related to monetary assets and liabilities and related forecast transactions. These non-designated currency forward contracts have an original time to maturity consistent with the hedged currency transaction exposures, generally less than
one year
, and are marked-to-market with changes in fair value recorded to earnings within
Other, net
within our accompanying unaudited consolidated statements of operations.
Interest Rate Hedging Instruments
Risk Management Strategy
Our interest rate risk relates primarily to U.S. dollar and euro-denominated borrowings partially offset by U.S. dollar cash investments. We use interest rate derivative instruments to mitigate the risk to our earnings and cash flows associated with exposure to changes in interest rates. Under these agreements, we and the counterparty, at specified intervals, exchange the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed-upon notional principal amount. We designate these derivative instruments either as fair value or cash flow hedges in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 815.
Hedge Designations and Relationships
We had
no
interest rate derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges outstanding as of March 31, 2025 or December 31, 2024. In the event that we designate outstanding interest rate derivative instruments as cash flow hedges, we record the changes in the fair value of the derivatives within OCI until the underlying hedged transaction occurs.
We had
no
interest rate derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges outstanding as of March 31, 2025 or December 31, 2024. In the event that we designate outstanding interest rate derivative instruments as fair value hedges, we record the changes in the fair values of interest-rate derivatives designated as fair value hedges and of the underlying hedged debt instruments in
Interest expense
, which generally offset.
The following table presents the contractual amounts of our hedging instruments outstanding:
(1)
Foreign currency-denominated debt is the €
900
million debt principal associated with our December 2027 Notes designated as a net investment hedge.
The remaining time to maturity as of March 31, 2025 is within
36
months for all forward currency contracts designated as cash flow hedges and generally less than
one year
for all non-designated forward currency contracts. The forward currency contracts designated as net investment hedges generally mature between
one
and
two
years. The euro-denominated debt principal designated as a net investment hedge has a contractual maturity of December 1, 2027.
The following presents the effect of our derivative and nonderivative instruments designated as cash flow and net investment hedges under FASB ASC Topic 815 within our accompanying unaudited consolidated statements of operations. Refer to

For our outstanding forward currency contracts designated as net investment hedges, the net gain or loss reclassified from AOCI to earnings as a reduction of
Interest expense
represents the straight-line amortization of the excluded component as calculated at the date of designation. This initial value of the excluded component has been excluded from the assessment of effectiveness in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 815. In the current and prior periods, we did not recognize any gains or losses on the components included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness in earnings.
(3)
For our outstanding euro-denominated debt principal designated as a net investment hedge, the change in fair value attributable to changes in the spot rate is recorded in the CTA component of OCI.
No
amounts were reclassified from AOCI to current period earnings.
As of March 31, 2025, pre-tax net gains or losses for our derivative instruments designated, or previously designated, as cash flow and net investment hedges under FASB ASC Topic 815 that may be reclassified from AOCI to earnings within the next twelve months are presented below (in millions):

Table of Contents
Net gains and losses on currency hedge contracts not designated as hedging instruments offset by net gains and losses from currency transaction exposures are presented below:
Fair Value Measurements
FASB ASC Topic 815 requires all derivative and nonderivative instruments to be recognized at their fair values as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet. We determine the fair value of our derivative and nonderivative instruments using the framework prescribed by FASB ASC Topic 820,
Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures
(FASB ASC Topic 820), and considering the estimated amount we would receive or pay to transfer these instruments at the reporting date with respect to current currency exchange rates, interest rates, the creditworthiness of the counterparty for unrealized gain positions and our own creditworthiness for unrealized loss positions. In certain instances, we may utilize financial models to measure fair value of our derivative and nonderivative instruments. In doing so, we use inputs that include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, other observable inputs for the asset or liability and inputs derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data by correlation or other means.
The following are the balances of our derivative and nonderivative assets and liabilities:
(1)
We classify derivative and nonderivative assets and liabilities as current when the settlement date of the contract is one year or less.
(2)
Foreign currency-denominated debt is the €
900
million debt principal associated with our December 2027 Notes designated as a net investment hedge. A portion of this notional is subject to de-designation and re-designation based on changes in the underlying hedged item.
16
Table of Contents
Recurring Fair Value Measurements
On a recurring basis, we measure certain financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value based upon quoted market prices. Where quoted market prices or other observable inputs are not available, we apply valuation techniques to estimate fair value. FASB ASC Topic 820 establishes a three-level valuation hierarchy for disclosure of fair value measurements. The category of a financial asset or a financial liability within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the measurement of fair value. The three levels of the hierarchy are defined as follows:
•
Level 1 – Inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted market prices for identical assets or liabilities.
•
Level 2 – Inputs to the valuation methodology are other observable inputs, including quoted market prices for similar assets or liabilities and market-corroborated inputs.
•
Level 3 – Inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable inputs based on management’s best estimate of inputs market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date, including assumptions about risk.
Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis consist of the following:
Our investments in money market funds and time deposits are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy because they are valued using quoted market prices. These investments are classified as
Cash and cash equivalents
or
Other current assets
within our accompanying unaudited consolidated balance sheets, in accordance with GAAP and our accounting policies. In addition to $
396
million invested in money market funds and time deposits as of March 31, 2025 and $
120
million as of December 31, 2024, we held $
345
million in interest-bearing and non-interest-bearing bank accounts as of March 31, 2025 and $
364
million as of December 31, 2024.
Our recurring fair value measurements using Level 3 inputs include those related to our contingent consideration liability. Refer to
Note B – Acquisitions and Strategic Investments
for a discussion of the changes in the fair value of our contingent consideration liability.
Non-Recurring Fair Value Measurements
We hold certain assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis in periods after initial recognition. The fair value of a measurement alternative investment is not estimated if there are no identified events or changes in circumstances that may have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment. Refer to
Note B – Acquisitions and Strategic Investments
for a discussion of our strategic investments and
Note C – Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
for a discussion of the fair values of our intangible assets including goodwill.

(2)
Corporate credit rating improvements may result in a decrease in the adjusted interest rate on our November 2035 Notes to the extent that our lowest credit rating is above BBB- or Baa3. The interest rates on our November 2035 Notes will be permanently reinstated to the issuance rate of
6.25
% if the lowest credit ratings assigned to these senior notes is either A- or A3 or higher.

These notes are euro-denominated and presented in U.S. dollars based on the exchange rate in effect as of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively.
Revolving Credit Facility
On May 10, 2021, we entered into a $
2.750
billion revolving credit facility (as amended, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the 2021 Revolving Credit Facility) with a global syndicate of commercial banks. On May 10, 2024, we entered into a third amendment to the 2021 Revolving Credit Facility credit agreement, which provided for, among other things, an extension of the scheduled maturity date to May 10, 2029, an amendment of the Ratings based pricing grid of the Applicable Margin, each as defined in the credit agreement, and reset the applicable date for purposes of determining the amounts of restructuring charges and restructuring-related expenses that may be excluded from consolidated Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA), as defined by the credit agreement, for purposes of our maximum leverage ratio covenant, from December 31, 2022 to March 31, 2024, as further discussed under
Financial Covenant
below.
This facility
18
Table of Contents
provides backing for our commercial paper program, and outstanding commercial paper directly reduces borrowing capacity under the 2021 Revolving Credit Facility. We had
no
amounts outstanding under the 2021 Revolving Credit Facility as of
March 31, 2025
or December 31, 2024.
Financial Covenant
As of March 31, 2025, we were in compliance with the financial covenant required by the 2021 Revolving Credit Facility.
(1)
Ratio of total debt to deemed consolidated EBITDA, as defined by the 2021 Revolving Credit Facility credit agreement.
The 2021 Revolving Credit Facility includes the financial covenant requirement for all of our credit arrangements that we maintain the maximum permitted leverage ratio of
3.75
times for the remaining term. The credit agreement provides for higher leverage ratios, at our election, for the period following a Qualified Acquisition, as defined by the agreement, for which consideration exceeds $
1.000
billion. In the event of such an acquisition, for the four succeeding quarters immediately following, including the quarter in which the acquisition occurs, the maximum permitted leverage ratio is
4.75
times. It steps down for the fifth, sixth and seventh succeeding quarters to
4.50
times,
4.25
times and
4.00
times, respectively. Thereafter, a maximum leverage ratio of
3.75
times is required through the remaining term of the 2021 Revolving Credit Facility. On November 15, 2024, we announced the closing of our acquisition of Axonics, Inc. (Axonics), which we had previously designated as a Qualified Acquisition under the credit agreement, increasing the maximum permitted leverage ratio to
4.75
times.
The financial covenant requirement, as amended on May 10, 2024, provides for an exclusion from the calculation of consolidated EBITDA, through maturity, of certain charges and expenses. The credit agreement amendment reset the starting date for purposes of calculating such permitted exclusions related to restructuring charges and restructuring-related expenses from December 31, 2022 to March 31, 2024. Permitted exclusions include up to $
500
million in cash and non-cash restructuring charges and restructuring-related expenses associated with our current or future restructuring plans. As of March 31, 2025, we had $
274
million of the restructuring charge exclusion remaining. In addition, any cash litigation payments (net of any cash litigation receipts), as defined by the agreement, are excluded from the calculation of consolidated EBITDA, provided that the sum of any excluded net cash litigation payments do not exceed $
1.000
billion plus all accrued legal liabilities as of December 31, 2022. As of March 31, 2025, we had $
1.429
billion of the litigation exclusion remaining.
Any inability to maintain compliance with this covenant could require us to seek to renegotiate the terms of our credit arrangements or seek waivers from compliance with this covenant, both of which could result in additional borrowing costs. Further, there can be no assurance that our lenders would agree to such new terms or grant such waivers on terms acceptable to us. In this case, all 2021 Revolving Credit Facility commitments would terminate, and any amounts borrowed under the facility would become immediately due and payable. Furthermore, any termination of our 2021 Revolving Credit Facility may negatively impact the credit ratings assigned to our commercial paper program, which may impact our ability to refinance any then outstanding commercial paper as it becomes due and payable
.
Commercial Paper
Our commercial paper program is backed by the 2021 Revolving Credit Facility. Outstanding commercial paper directly reduces borrowing capacity under the 2021 Revolving Credit Facility. We had no amounts outstanding under our commercial paper program as of March 31, 2025 and $
191
million outstanding as of December 31, 2024.

Senior Notes
We had senior notes outstanding of
$
11.243
billion
as of March 31, 2025 and $
10.451
billion as of December 31, 2024. Our senior notes were issued in public offerings, are redeemable prior to maturity and are not subject to sinking fund requirements. Our senior notes are unsecured, unsubordinated obligations and rank on parity with each other. These notes are effectively junior to liabilities of our subsidiaries (refer to
Other Arrangements
below).
In February 2025, American Medical Systems Europe B.V. (AMS Europe), an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of Boston Scientific, completed a registered public offering of €
1.500
billion in aggregate principal amount of euro-denominated senior notes comprised of €
850
million of
3.000
% Senior Notes due 2031 and €
650
million of
3.250
% Senior Notes due 2034 (collectively, the 2025 Eurobonds). Boston Scientific has fully and unconditionally guaranteed all of AMS Europe's obligations under the 2025 Eurobonds, and no other subsidiary of Boston Scientific will guarantee these obligations. AMS Europe is a “finance subsidiary” as defined in Rule 13-01(a)(4)(vi) of Regulation S-X. The financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of AMS Europe are consolidated in the financial statements of Boston Scientific. The 2025 Eurobonds offering resulted in cash proceeds of $
1.558
billion, net of investor discounts and issuance costs.
We used the net proceeds from the 2025 Eurobonds offering to fund the repayment at maturity of AMS Europe’s
0.750
% Senior Notes due March 8, 2025 and to pay accrued and unpaid interest with respect to such notes.
Additionally, we plan to use the remaining net proceeds for general corporate purposes, which may include, among other things, short term investments, reduction of short term debt, funding of working capital and potential future acquisitions.
In February 2024, AMS Europe completed a registered public offering of €
2.000
billion in aggregate principal amount of euro-denominated senior notes comprised of €
750
million of
3.375
% Senior Notes due 2029 and €
1.250
billion of
3.500
% Senior Notes due 2032 (collectively, the 2024 Eurobonds). Boston Scientific has fully and unconditionally guaranteed all of AMS Europe's obligations under the 2024 Eurobonds, in addition to all of AMS Europe's obligations under the euro-denominated senior notes that were previously issued by AMS Europe in 2022, and no other subsidiary of Boston Scientific will guarantee these obligations. The 2024 Eurobonds offering resulted in cash proceeds of $
2.145
billion, net of investor discounts and issuance costs.
We primarily used the net proceeds from the 2024 Eurobonds offering to fund a portion of the purchase price of our acquisition of Axonics and to pay related fees and expenses, and for general corporate purposes. We also used the net proceeds to fund the repayment at maturity of our
3.450
% Senior Notes due March 2024 and to pay accrued and unpaid interest with respect to such notes.
Other Arrangements
We have accounts receivable factoring programs in certain European countries and with commercial banks in China and Japan which include promissory notes discounting programs. We account for our factoring programs as sales under FASB ASC Topic 860,
Transfers and Servicing
. We have no retained interest in the transferred receivables, other than collection and administration, and once sold, the accounts receivable are no longer available to satisfy creditors in the event of bankruptcy.

NOTE G – INCOME TAXES
The following table provides a reconciliation of our reported tax rate to the rate from continuing operations:
(1)
These receipts/charges are taxed at different rates than our rate from continuing operations.
Our reported tax rate is affected by recurring items such as the amount of our earnings subject to differing tax rates in foreign jurisdictions and the impact of certain receipts and charges that are taxed at rates that differ from our rate from continuing operations.
In the first quarter of 2025, the principal reasons for the difference between the rate from continuing operations and our reported tax rate relates to certain acquisition-related net charges, and discrete tax benefits primarily related to stock-based compensation.
In the first quarter of 2024, the principal reasons for the difference between the rate from continuing operations and our reported tax rate relates to certain acquisition-related net charges, and certain discrete tax benefits primarily related to unrecognized tax benefits and stock-based compensation.
As of March 31, 2025, we had $
514
million of gross unrecognized tax benefits, of which a net $
431
million, if recognized, would affect our effective tax rate. As of December 31, 2024, we had $
506
million of gross unrecognized tax benefits, of which a net $
423
million, if recognized, would affect our effective tax rate. The change in gross unrecognized tax benefit is primarily related to current year accruals for reserves.
NOTE H – COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
The medical device market in which we participate is largely technology driven. As a result, intellectual property rights, particularly patents and trade secrets, play a significant role in product development and differentiation. Over the years, there has been litigation initiated against us by others, including our competitors, claiming that our current or former product offerings infringe patents owned or licensed by them. Intellectual property litigation is inherently complex and unpredictable. In addition, competing parties frequently file multiple suits to leverage patent portfolios across product lines, technologies and geographies and to balance risk and exposure between the parties. In some cases, several competitors are parties in the same proceeding, or in a series of related proceedings, or litigate multiple features of a single class of devices. These dynamics frequently drive settlement not only for individual cases, but also for a series of pending and potentially related and unrelated cases. Although monetary and injunctive relief is typically sought, remedies and restitution are generally not determined until the conclusion of the trial court proceedings and can be modified on appeal. Accordingly, the outcomes of individual cases are difficult to time, predict or quantify and are often dependent upon the outcomes of other cases in other geographies.
During recent years, we successfully negotiated closure of several long-standing legal matters and have received favorable rulings in several other matters; however, there continues to be outstanding litigation. Adverse outcomes in one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our ability to sell certain products and on our operating margins, financial position, results of operations and/or liquidity.
In addition, product liability, securities and commercial claims have been asserted against us and similar claims may be asserted against us in the future related to events not known to management at the present time. We maintain an insurance policy providing limited coverage against securities claims and we are substantially self-insured with respect to product liability claims and fully self-insured with respect to intellectual property infringement claims. The absence of significant third-party insurance coverage increases our potential exposure to unanticipated claims or adverse decisions. Product liability claims, securities and commercial litigation and other legal proceedings in the future, regardless of their outcome, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to sell certain products and on our operating margins, financial position, results of operations and/or liquidity.
In addition, like other companies in the medical device industry, we are subject to extensive regulation by national, state and local government agencies in the U.S. and other countries in which we operate. From time to time we are the subject of qui tam actions and governmental investigations often involving regulatory, marketing and other business practices. These qui tam
24
Table of Contents
actions and governmental investigations could result in the commencement of civil and criminal proceedings, substantial fines, penalties and administrative remedies and have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and/or liquidity. For additional information, refer to
Note I – Commitments and Contingencies
to our audited financial statements contained in Item 8 of our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K.
In accordance with FASB ASC Topic 450,
Contingencies
, we accrue anticipated costs of settlement, damages, losses for product liability claims and, under certain conditions, costs of defense, based on historical experience or to the extent specific losses are probable and estimable. Otherwise, we expense these costs as incurred. If the estimate of a probable loss is a range and no amount within the range is more likely, we accrue the minimum amount of the range.
Our accrual for legal matters that are probable and estimable was $
316
million as of March 31, 2025 and $
326
million as of December 31, 2024 and includes certain estimated costs of settlement, damages and defense primarily related to product liability cases or claims and matters assumed from acquired companies. We record certain legal and product liability charges, credits and costs of defense, which we consider to be unusual or infrequent and significant as
Litigation-related net charges (credits)
within our accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements.
We did not record any litigation-related net charges (credits) during the first quarter of 2025 and
2024.
All other legal and product liability charges, credits and costs are recorded within
Selling, general and administrative expenses
within our accompanying unaudited consolidated statements of operations.
We continue to assess certain litigation and claims to determine the amounts, if any, that management believes will be paid as a result of such claims and litigation and, therefore, additional losses may be accrued and paid in the future, which could materially adversely impact our operating results, cash flows and/or our ability to comply with our financial covenant required by our credit arrangements.
In management's opinion, we are not currently involved in any legal proceedings other than those disclosed in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and those specifically identified below, which, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, operations and/or cash flows. Unless included in our legal accrual or otherwise indicated below, a range of loss associated with any individual material legal proceeding cannot be reasonably estimated.
Patent Litigation
On November 20, 2017, The Board of Regents, University of Texas System and TissueGen. Inc. (collectively, UT), served a lawsuit against us in the Western District of Texas. The complaint against the Company alleges patent infringement of two U.S. patents owned by UT, relating to “Drug Releasing Biodegradable Fiber Implant” and “Drug Releasing Biodegradable Fiber for Delivery of Therapeutics,” and affects the manufacture, use and sale of our Synergy™ Stent System. UT primarily seeks a reasonable royalty. On March 12, 2018, the District Court for the Western District of Texas dismissed the action and transferred it to the United States District Court for the District of Delaware. On September 5, 2019, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed the dismissal of the District Court for the Western District of Texas. In April 2020, the United States Supreme Court denied the UT’s Petition for Certiorari. UT proceeded with its case against the Company in Delaware. In January 2023, a jury trial was held on the issue of whether the one UT patent still asserted in the case was valid and whether it was infringed by the Company. On January 31, 2023, a jury concluded that UT’s patent was valid and willfully infringed by the Company, and awarded UT $
42
million in damages. Following the trial, UT filed a motion seeking prejudgment interest and enhanced damages. The Company filed a motion seeking judgment as a matter of law in its favor or alternatively a new trial. On June 5, 2024, the Court granted the Company’s motion for judgment as a matter of law of no willful infringement, but otherwise denied the Company’s motions. The Court also denied UT’s motion for enhanced damages, awarded approximately $
7
million in pre-judgment interest, and awarded post-judgment interest. On July 3, 2024, UT and the Company each filed a notice of appeal.
Upon the Company’s acquisition of Axonics on November 15, 2024, the Company assumed responsibility for all litigation pending against Axonics. On September 18, 2023, Axonics commenced an arbitration dispute against the Al Mann Foundation (AMF), in response to which AMF asserted multiple claims against Axonics. This arbitration will resolve, among other things, whether AMF terminated its licensing agreement with Axonics and whether Axonics owes royalties to AMF for its non-rechargeable sacral neuromodulation products. This dispute is scheduled for an arbitration hearing in July 2025.
Product Liability Litigation
Multiple product liability cases or claims related to transvaginal surgical mesh products designed to treat stress urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse have been asserted against us, predominantly in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Scotland, Ireland, and Australia. Plaintiffs generally seek monetary damages based on allegations of personal injury
25
Table of Contents
associated with the use of our transvaginal surgical mesh products, including design and manufacturing claims, failure to warn, breach of warranty, fraud, violations of state consumer protection laws and loss of consortium claims. We have entered into individual and master settlement agreements or are in the final stages of entering agreements with certain plaintiffs' counsel, to resolve the majority of these cases and claims. All settlement agreements were entered into solely by way of compromise and without any admission or concession by us of any liability or wrongdoing. In addition, in April 2021 the Company's Board of Directors received a shareholder demand under section 220 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, for inspection of books and records related to mesh settlements. The Company has notified our insurer and retained counsel to respond to the demand.
We have established a product liability accrual for remaining claims asserted against us associated with our transvaginal surgical mesh products and the costs of defense thereof. We continue to engage in discussions with plaintiffs’ counsel regarding potential resolution of pending cases and claims, which we continue to vigorously contest. The final resolution of the cases and claims is uncertain and could have a material impact on our results of operations, financial condition and/or liquidity. Trials involving our transvaginal surgical mesh products have resulted in both favorable and unfavorable judgments for us. We do not believe that the judgment in any one trial is representative of potential outcomes of all cases or claims related to our transvaginal surgical mesh products.
Governmental Investigations and Qui Tam Matters
Like many healthcare companies, the Company receives inquiries and has ongoing discussions with governmental agencies with respect to the Company’s operations, such as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Department of Justice (DOJ) and foreign regulators, including its operations in Vietnam with respect to alleged Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) violations the Company received in March 2022. The Company has received related subpoenas for documents from the DOJ and the SEC with respect to the Vietnam matter, and is cooperating with the government while investigating these allegations. From time to time, the Company also self-discloses potential concerns to regulators. In the course of Vietnam-related discussions with the DOJ and SEC, the Company has disclosed that it is investigating other potential concerns in Vietnam and other countries.
From time to time, the Company also receives U.S.-based subpoenas and DOJ Civil Investigative Demands (CID), including the following matters: in April 2023, the Company received a DOJ subpoena that seeks documents and information related to its ambulatory electrocardiography monitoring business; in December 2023, the Company received a DOJ CID related to the provision of peripheral intervention services through office-based labs. The Company is cooperating with the DOJ in these matters.
Other Proceedings
On December 4, 2020, Enrique Jevons, individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated, filed a class action complaint against the Company, Michael F. Mahoney and Daniel J. Brennan, stemming from the recall and retirement of the LOTUS Edge™ Aortic Valve System (LOTUS System) in United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York. On December 14, 2020, the parties agreed to transfer the case to the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts. On December 16, 2020, Mariano Errichiello, individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated, filed a second, materially similar class action complaint against the Company, Michael F. Mahoney, Joseph M. Fitzgerald, and Daniel J. Brennan in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts. Subsequently, on March 30, 2021, the Court consolidated the two actions, and appointed Union Asset Management Holding AG as the lead plaintiff. The plaintiffs filed an Amended Complaint in June 2021 that seeks unspecified compensatory damages in favor of the alleged class as well as unspecified equitable relief. The Company filed a Motion to Dismiss in July 2021, which, in December 2022, the Court granted in part and denied in part. On October 23, 2023, the Company reached an agreement in principle with the lead plaintiff to settle the case. The Court granted the motion for preliminary approval of the proposed settlement on December 27, 2023, and approved the settlement and dismissed the case on April 23, 2024.

On February 8, 2021, the Company received a letter from The Vladimir Gusinsky Revocable Trust, a shareholder, demanding that the Company’s Board of Directors conduct an investigation into actions by the Company’s directors and executive officers regarding statements made about the effectiveness and commercial viability of the LOTUS System. The Trust subsequently agreed to stay its demand, pending the outcome of any dispositive motion against the Amended Complaint in the class action complaint described above. The Company received letters on behalf of the Union Excavators Local 731 Pension Fund, Diane Nachbaur, and Frank Tripson, three stockholders of the Company, on July 26, 2021, July 29, 2021, and February 13, 2023, respectively, each demanding access to certain books and records of the Company, pursuant to Section 220 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, regarding the business, operations, effectiveness and commercial viability of the LOTUS system, and related items. On April 7, 2023, Diane Nachbaur filed a shareholder derivative complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts against the Company, Michael F. Mahoney, Nelda J. Connors, Charles J. Dockendorff, Yoshiaki Fujimori, Donna A. James, Edward J. Ludwig, David Roux, John E. Sununu, Ellen M. Zane, Joseph M. Fitzgerald, Daniel J. Brennan, Shawn McCarthy, Ian Meredith, Kevin Ballinger, and Susan Vissers Lisa. On May 8, 2023, the Court stayed the case until the conclusion of the consolidated class action case. On October 18, 2023, Frank Tripson filed a shareholder derivative complaint in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware against the Company, Michael F. Mahoney, Daniel J. Brennan, Joseph M. Fitzgerald, Shawn McCarthy, Kevin Ballinger, Ian Meredith, Susan Vissers Lisa, Nelda J. Connors, Charles J. Dockendorff, Yoshiaki Fujimori, Donna A. James, Edward J. Ludwig, Stephen P. MacMillan, David Roux, John E. Sununu, and Ellen M. Zane. On December 15, 2023, the Court stayed that case until March 31, 2024. On March 26, 2024, the Company reached an agreement in principle with all of the plaintiffs to resolve the matters. On January 8, 2025, the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts issued an order granting preliminary approval to the proposed settlement. On March 13, 2025, the Court approved the settlement and dismissed the Nachbaur Massachusetts case with prejudice. On March 18, 2025, the Delaware Chancery Court dismissed the Tripson Delaware case with prejudice.
NOTE I – WEIGHTED AVERAGE SHARES OUTSTANDING
The following securities were excluded from the calculation of weighted average shares outstanding - diluted because their effect in the periods presented below would have been antidilutive:
(1)
Represents stock options outstanding pursuant to our employee stock-based compensation plans with exercise prices that were greater than the average fair market value of our common stock for the related periods.
We base
Net income (loss) per common share - diluted
upon the weighted-average number of common shares and common stock equivalents outstanding during each year. Potential common stock equivalents are determined using the treasury stock method. We exclude stock options and stock awards from the calculation if the effect would be anti-dilutive.
We issued approximately
five
million shares of our common stock in the first quarter of 2025 and approximately
four
million shares in the first quarter of 2024. Shares were issued following the exercise of stock options, vesting of restricted stock units or purchases under our employee stock purchase plan. We did
not
repurchase any shares of our common stock in the first quarter of 2025 or 2024. On December 14, 2020, our Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program authorizing the repurchase of up to $
1.000
billion of our common stock. As of March 31, 2025, we had the full amount remaining available under the authorization.

NOTE J – SEGMENT REPORTING
We aggregate our core businesses into
two
reportable segments: MedSurg and Cardiovascular, each of which generates revenues from the sale of medical devices. In accordance with FASB ASC Topic 280,
Segment Reporting
, we identified our reportable segments based on the nature of our products, production processes, type of customer, selling and distribution methods and regulatory environment, as well as the economic characteristics of each of our operating segments. Our chief operating decision maker (CODM) is our President and Chief Executive Officer.
We measure and evaluate our reportable segments based on their respective net sales, cost of goods sold, selling, general and administrative expenses, research and development expenses, operating income, excluding intersegment profits, and operating income as a percentage of net sales, all based on internally-derived standard currency exchange rates to exclude the impact of foreign currency, which may be updated from year to year. We exclude from segment expenses and segment operating income certain corporate-related expenses and certain transactions or adjustments that our CODM considers to be non-operational, such as amounts related to amortization expense, goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges, acquisition/divestiture-related net charges (credits), restructuring and restructuring-related net charges (credits), certain litigation-related net charges (credits) and European Union (EU) Medical Device Regulation (MDR) implementation costs. Although we exclude these amounts from segment expenses and segment operating income they are included in reported
Income (loss) before income taxes
within our accompanying unaudited consolidated statements of operations and are included in the reconciliation below. The CODM uses segment operating income in the budget and forecasting process and to monitor budget versus actual results, which are used in assessing the performance of the reportable segments and to allocate resources across our reportable segments Refer to

NOTE M – NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
Periodically, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the FASB or other standard setting bodies. Recently issued standards typically do not require adoption until a future effective date. Prior to their effective date, we evaluate the pronouncements to determine the potential effects of adoption on our accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements. During the first quarter of 2025, we implemented the following standard on a prospective basis, which did not have a material impact on our unaudited consolidated financial statements:
ASC Update No. 2023-09
ASC Update No. 2023-09,
Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures
enhances the transparency and decision usefulness of income tax disclosures. Update No. 2023-09 modifies the rules on income tax disclosures to require entities to annually disclose (1) specific categories in the rate reconciliation, (2) the income or loss from continuing operations before income tax expense or benefit (separated between domestic and foreign) and (3) income tax expense or benefit from continuing operations (separated by federal, state, and foreign). Update No. 2023-09 also requires entities to disclose their income tax payments to international, federal, state and local jurisdictions, among other changes.
Standards to be Implemented
In November 2024, the FASB issued ASC Update No. 2024-03
Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income - Expense Disaggregation Disclosures
. Update No. 2024-03 aims to improve transparency of expense disclosures to enhance investor understanding of an entity's performance and to assist in comparing an entity's performance over time and with that of other entities. Update No. 2024-03 modifies the disclosures over certain costs and expenses and requires entities to disclose (1) the amounts of purchases of inventory, employee compensation, depreciation, intangible asset amortization, and depletion, included in each relevant expense caption, (2) within the same disclosure, certain amounts that are already required to be disclosed under current GAAP, (3) a qualitative description of the amounts remaining in relevant expense captions that are not separately disaggregated quantitatively and (4) the total amount of selling expenses and, in annual reporting periods, an entity’s definition of selling expenses. The amendments in this Update are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2027. Update No. 2024-03 allows for early adoption and requires either prospective adoption to financial statements issued for reporting periods after the effective date, or retrospectively to any or all prior periods presented in the financial statements. We are currently assessing the impact of Update No. 2024-03 to our consolidated financial statement disclosures.
No other new accounting pronouncements issued or effective in the period had or are expected to have a material impact on our accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements.

Financial Summary
Three Months Ended March 31, 2025
Our net sales for the first quarter of 2025 were $4.663 billion, compared to $3.856 billion for the first quarter of 2024. This increase of $806 million, or 20.9 percent, included operational
1
net sales growth of 22.2 percent and the negative impact of 130 basis points from foreign currency fluctuations. Operational net sales growth included organic
2
net sales growth of 18.2 percent and the positive impact of 400 basis points from certain acquisitions during the period

In 2024, acquisitions included the endoluminal vacuum therapy portfolio of B. Braun Medical Inc. (Braun), Silk Road Medical, Inc. (Silk Road Medical) and Axonics, Inc. (Axonics), during the first, third and fourth quarters of 2024
, respec
tively. There were no applicable acquisitions in the first quarter of 2025. The increase in our net sales was primarily driven by strong commercial execution across our businesses, particularly in our Electrophysiology business unit, which was led by the rapid adoption of our Farapulse™ Pulsed Field Ablation System which launched in 2024. Refer to
Quarterly Results and Business Overview

Item 1. Business
of our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K.
MedSurg
Endoscopy
Our Endoscopy business develops and manufactures devices to diagnose and treat a broad range of gastrointestinal (GI) conditions with innovative, less-invasive technologies. Net sales of Endoscopy products of $673 million during the first quarter of 2025 represented 14 percent of

un during the
first quarter of
2024.
Organic net sales growth was primarily driven by our biliary franchise led by our AXIOS™ Stent and Delivery System, and our endoluminal surgery franchise.
Urology

Table of Contents
Cardiovascular
Cardiology
Our Cardiology business develops and manufactures devices and medical technologies for diagnosing and treating a variety of diseases and abnormalities of the heart. Net sales of Cardiology products of $2.429 billion during the first quarter of 2025 represented 52 percent of our consolidated net sales. Cardiology net sales increased $558 million, or 29.8 percent, during the first quarter of 2025, compared to the prior year period. During the first quarter of 2025, this increase included operational net sales growth of 31.2 percent and the negative impact of 140 basis points from forei
gn currency fluctuations, compared to the prior year period.
Operational net sales growth was primarily driven by growth of our Electrophysiology business unit, led by our Farapulse™ Pulsed Field Ablation System, continued market penetration of Left Atrial Appendage Closure (LAAC) procedures with our WATCHMAN FLX™ LAAC Device and our WATCHMAN FLX™ Pro LAAC Device, as well as our coronary therapies franchise led by the recent U.S. launch of our AGENT™ Drug-Coated Balloon.
Peripheral Interventions
Our Peripheral Interventions business develops and manufactures products to diagnose and treat peripheral arterial and venous diseases, as well as products to diagnose, treat and ease various forms of cancer. Net sales of Peripheral Interventions products of $656 million during the first quarter of 2025 represented 14 percent of our consolidated net sales. Peripheral Interventions net sales increased $83 million, or 14.4 percent, during the first quarter of 2025, compared to the prior year period. During the first quarter of 2025, this increase included operational net sales growth of 15.8 percent and the negative impact of 140 basis points from foreign currency fluctuations, compared to the prior year period. Operational net sales growth during the first quarter of 2025 included organic net sales growth of 7.4 percent and the positive impact of 840 basis points from our acquisition of Silk Road Medical during the third quarter of 2024.
Organic net sales growth was primarily driven by our interventional oncology franchise led by our Therasphere™ Y-90 Radioactive Glass Microspheres and EMBOLD™ Fibered Coil, as well as our drug-eluting portfolio within our vascular franchise led by our Ranger™ Drug Coated Balloon.
Emerging Markets
As part of our strategic imperative to drive global expansion, we are seeking to grow net sales and market share by expanding our global presence, including in Emerging Markets. Our Emerging Markets countries include all countries except the United States, Western and Central Europe, Japan, Australia, New Zealand and Canada.
Our Emerging Markets' net sales represented 15 percent of our consolidated net sales during the first quarter of 2025 and 17 percent during the first quarter of 2024. During the first quarter of 2025, our Emerging Markets net sales grew 6.5 percent on a reported basis, which included operational net sales growth of 9.8 percent and a negative impact of 330 basis points from foreign currency fluctuations, compared to the prior year period. Operational net sales growth was primarily driven by growth in China, fueled by the breadth of our portfolio and focus on innovation and strong commercial execution.
Economic Environment
As a global developer, manufacturer and marketer of medical devices, our business is subject to local and international macroeconomic trends as well as geopolitical factors. While global supply chain disruptions continued to improve recently, we have experienced, and may continue to experience, increases in cost and limited availability of certain raw materials, components, and other inputs necessary to manufacture and distribute our products due to constraints and inflation within the global supply chain, as well as increases in wage costs and the cost and time to distribute our products. Uncertainty around inflationary pressures, interest rates, monetary policy, trade and tariff policies, foreign currency fluctuations and changes in tax laws, as well as actions by governments in response thereto, could create additional economic challenges which could negatively impact our business operations and results. We anticipate incurring incremental costs under the current schedule of reciprocal tariffs on U.S. imports recently introduced by the U.S. and the subsequent increase in tariffs implemented by China on U.S. manufactured products; these and any further tariff increases on our products by the U.S., China or any other country as well as sanctions or other measures that restrict international trade could materially negatively affect our business operations and results. While we are exploring opportunities to mitigate these negative impacts, there can be no guarantee that we will be able to offset the impact of tariffs, the ultimate impact of which will depend on various factors, including the timing, scope, and nature of any tariffs or other trade policies. In addition, geopolitical developments, including related to various ongoing global
36

conflicts and tensions, may create economic, supply chain, transportation, energy, and other challenges, including disruptions to business operations, which could negatively impact our business and results of operations.
Gross Profit
Our
Gross profit
was $3.210 billion for the first quarter of 2025 and $2.648 billion for the first quarter of 2024. The following is a reconciliation of our gross profit margin and a description of the drivers of the changes from period to period:
Gross profit margin increased in the first quarter of 2025 as compared to the same period in the prior year. The primary factors that impacted gross profit margin in the first quarter of 2025 were increased sales of higher margin products, offset by inventory charges and other period expenses.
Operating Expenses
The following table provides a summary of our key operating expenses:
Selling, General and Administrative
(
SG&A) Expenses
During the first quarter of 2025,
SG&A expenses
increased $233 million, or 17 percent, compared to the prior year period and were 120 basis points lower as a percentage of net sales. The increase in
SG&A expenses
was driven in part by higher selling costs driven by higher global net sales and costs to support product launches, including the Farapulse™ Pulsed Field Ablation System in our Electrophysiology business unit.
Research and Development
(
R&D) Expenses
We remain committed to advancing medical technologies and investing in meaningful R&D projects across our businesses. During the first quarter of 2025,
R&D expenses
increased $77 million, or 21 percent, compared to the prior year period and remained flat as a percentage of net sales.
R&D expenses
increased as a result of investments across our businesses in order to maintain a pipeline of new products that we believe will contribute to profitable sales growth.
Other Operating Expenses
The following provides a summary of certain of our other operating expenses, which are excluded by management for purposes of evaluating operating performance; refer to
Additional Information

Amortization Expense
During the first quarter of 2025,
Amortization expense
increased $6 million, or 3 percent, compared to the prior year period.

Contingent Consideration Net Expense (Benefit)
To recognize changes in the fair value of our contingent consideration liability, we recorded net charges of $5 million and $17 million in the first quarter of 2025 and 2024, respectively. In addition, we did not make any payments during the first quarter of 2025 and we made payments of $123 million associated with prior acquisitions during the first quarter of 2024, following the achievement of revenue-based earnouts. Refer to
Note B – Acquisitions and Strategic Investments
to our unaudited consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional details related to our contingent consideration arrangements.
Restructuring and Restructuring-related Net Charges (Credits)
On February 22, 2023, our Board of Directors approved, and we committed to, a new global restructuring program (the 2023 Restructuring Plan). The 2023 Restructuring Plan is helping to advance our Global Supply Chain Optimization strategy, which is intended to simplify our manufacturing and distribution network by transferring certain production lines among facilities and drive operational efficiencies and resiliency. Key activities under the 2023 Restructuring Plan also include optimizing certain functional capabilities to achieve cost synergies and better support business growth. For more information, refer to
2023 Restructuring Plan
contained in Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Pursuant to the 2023 Restructuring Plan, we recorded the following restructuring and restructuring-related charges:
(1)
These charges are recorded in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 420,
Exit or Disposal Cost Obligations.
(2)
These charges are primarily recorded within
Cost of products sold, SG&A Expenses
and
R&D Expenses
.
The following table presents our restructuring reserve balance:
Litigation-related Net Charges (Credits)
We record certain legal and product liability charges, credits and costs of defense, which we consider to be unusual or infrequent and significant as
Litigation-related net charges (credits)
within our accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements. We did not record any litigation-related net charges (credits) during the first quarter of 2025 or 2024. All other legal and product liability charges, credits and costs are recorded within
SG&A expenses
.
We continue to assess certain litigation and claims to determine the amounts, if any, that management believes will be paid as a result of such claims and litigation, and therefore, additional losses may be accrued and paid in the future, which could materially adversely impact our operating results, cash flows and/or our ability to comply with the financial covenant required by our credit arrangements.

Interest Expense
The following table provides a summary of our
Interest expense
and average borrowing rate:
Interest expense
increased during the first quarter of 2025 compared to the prior year period primarily due to increased debt from the registered public offering of €1.500 billion in aggregate principal amount of euro-denominated senior notes (the 2025 Eurobonds) during the quarter. Our average borrowing rate increased during the first quarter of 2025 compared to the prior year period. Refer to
Liquidity and Capital Resources
and
Note E – Contractual Obligations and Commitments
to our unaudited consolidated financial statements contained in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for more information regarding our debt obligations.
Tax Rate
The following table provides a reconciliation of our reported tax rate to the rate from continuing operations:
(1)
These receipts/charges are taxed at different rates than our rate from continuing operations.
Our reported tax rate is affected by recurring items such as the amount of our earnings subject to differing tax rates in foreign jurisdictions and the impact of certain receipts and charges that are taxed at rates that differ from our rate from continuing operations.
In the first quarter of 2025, the principal reasons for the difference between the rate from continuing operations and our reported tax rate relates to certain acquisition-related net charges, and discrete tax benefits primarily related to stock-based compensation.
In the first quarter of 2024, the principal reasons for the difference between the rate from continuing operations and our reported tax rate relates to certain acquisition-related net charges, and certain discrete tax benefits primarily related to unrecognized tax benefits and stock-based compensation.
Effective January 1, 2024, many countries where we do business adopted a global minimum effective tax rate of 15% based on the Pillar Two framework issued by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). Other countries where we do business are also considering adopting the framework or are in various stages of enacting the framework into their country’s laws. The impact of the Pillar Two global minimum tax on our 2024 tax rate from continuing operations was immaterial, and we expect a similar impact in 2025 based on the countries that have adopted the Pillar Two rules, and the guidance issued to date.
The Company continues to monitor further legislative adoption of the Pillar Two rules by country. The United States has not enacted the Pillar Two global minimum tax, and the current administration announced its intention to effectively withdraw from the OECD Inclusive Framework as well as its intention to enact retaliatory measures against countries who assert extraterritorial taxes against U.S. taxpayers. In addition, significant uncertainty exists regarding the interpretation of the detailed Pillar Two rules, whether such rules will be implemented consistently across taxing jurisdictions, how such rules interact with existing national tax laws and whether such rules are consistent with existing tax treaty obligations. Developments related to these uncertainties could impact our expectations regarding the impact of the Pillar Two global minimum tax on our tax rate from continuing operations in 2025.

Our operations presently benefit from various tax provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs act which are set to expire in 2025. If future legislation is unable to extend or modify these provisions, this could have a material adverse impact on our overall effective tax rate, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.
See
Note G – Income Taxes
to our unaudited consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional details on our tax rate.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Our financial results are affected by the selection and application of accounting policies and methods. During the first quarter of 2025, there were no material changes to the application of critical accounting policies previously disclosed in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Based on our current business plan, we believe our existing balance of
Cash and cash equivalents
, future cash generated from operations, access to capital markets and existing credit facilities will be sufficient to fund our operations, invest in our infrastructure, pay our legal-related liabilities, pay taxes due, service and repay our existing debt and fund possible acquisitions for the next 12 months and for the foreseeable future.
As of March 31, 2025, we had $725 million of unrestricted
Cash and cash equivalents
on hand, including approximately $104 million held by Acotec Scientific Holdings Limited, a less than wholly owned entity of which we acquired a majority stake investment during the first quarter of 2024.
The balance is comprised of $381 million invested in money market funds and time deposits and $345 million in interest bearing and non-interest-bearing bank accounts. We invest excess cash on hand in short-term financial instruments that earn at market interest rates while mitigating principal risk through instrument and counterparty diversification, as well as what we believe to be prudent instrument selection. We limit our direct exposure to securities in any one industry or issuer.
In 2021, we entered into our $2.750 billion revolving credit facility (as amended, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the 2021 Revolving Credit Facility) with a global syndicate of commercial banks. The 2021 Revolving Credit Facility has a maturity date of May 10, 2029. This facility provides backing for our commercial paper program, and outstanding commercial paper directly reduces borrowing capacity under the 2021 Revolving Credit Facility. There were no amounts outstanding under the 2021 Revolving Credit Facility or our commercial paper program as of March 31, 2025, resulting in an additional $2.750 billion of available liquidity.
For additional details related to our debt obligations, including our financial covenant requirement, refer to
Note E – Contractual Obligations and Commitments
to our unaudited consolidated financial statements contained in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
The following provides a summary and description of our net cash inflows (outflows):
Operating Activities
During the first quarter of 2025, cash provided by (used for) operating activities increased $378 million compared to the prior year period primarily due to comparatively higher sales and corresponding operating income, partially offset by an increase in employee related payments.

Table of Contents
Investing Activities
During the first quarter of 2025, cash provided by (used for) investing activities included
net cash payments of $239 million for the acquisition of Cortex, Inc., as well as
purchases of property, plant and equipment and internal use software
of $187 million. During the first quarter of 2024, cash used for investing activities included
purchases of property, plant and equipment and internal use software
of $179 million. For more information on our acquisitions, refer to
Note B – Acquisitions and Strategic Investments
to our unaudited consolidated financial statements contained in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
Financing Activities
During the first quarter of 2025, cash provided by (used for) financing activities included the registered public offering of €1.500 billion in aggregate principal amount of euro-denominated senior notes (the 2025 Eurobonds), partially offset by net payments of commercial paper of $192 million.
The 2025 Eurobonds offering resulted in cash proceeds of $1.558 billion, net of investor discounts and issuance costs. We used the net proceeds from the 2025 Eurobonds offering to fund the repayment at maturity of AMS Europe’s 0.750% Senior Notes due March 8, 2025 and to pay accrued and unpaid interest with respect to such notes. Additionally, we plan to use the remaining net proceeds for general corporate purposes, which may include, among other things, short term investments, reduction of short term debt, funding of working capital and potential future acquisitions.
For more information, refer to
Note E – Contractual Obligations and Commitments
to our unaudited consolidated financial statements contained in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Cash provided by (used for) financing activities in the first quarter of 2024 included a registered public offering of €2.000 billion in aggregate principal amount of euro-denominated senior notes (the 2024 Eurobonds). The 2024 Eurobonds offering resulted in cash proceeds of $2.145 billion, net of investor discounts and issuance costs. We primarily used the net proceeds from the 2024 Eurobonds offering to fund a portion of the purchase price of our acquisition of Axonics and to pay related fees and expenses, and for general corporate purposes. We also used the net proceeds to fund the repayment at maturity of our 3.450% Senior Notes due March 2024 and to pay accrued and unpaid interest with respect to such notes.
Financial Covenant
As of March 31, 2025, we were in compliance with the financial covenant required by the 2021 Revolving Credit Facility.
(1)
Ratio of total debt to deemed consolidated EBITDA, as defined by the 2021 Revolving Credit Facility credit agreement.
The 2021 Revolving Credit Facility includes the financial covenant requirement for all of our credit arrangements that we maintain the maximum permitted leverage ratio of 3.75 times for the remaining term. The credit agreement provides for higher leverage ratios, at our election, for the period following a Qualified Acquisition, as defined by the agreement, for which consideration exceeds $1.000 billion. In the event of such an acquisition, for the four succeeding quarters immediately following, including the quarter in which the acquisition occurs, the maximum permitted leverage ratio is 4.75 times. It steps down for the fifth, sixth and seventh succeeding quarters to 4.50 times, 4.25 times and 4.00 times, respectively. Thereafter, a maximum leverage ratio of 3.75 times is required through the remaining term of the 2021 Revolving Credit Facility. On November 15, 2024, we announced the closing of our acquisition of Axonics, which we had previously designated as a Qualified Acquisition under the credit agreement, increasing the maximum permitted leverage ratio to 4.75 times as of March 31, 2025. We believe that we have the ability to comply with the financial covenant for the next 12 months.
The financial covenant requirement, as amended on May 10, 2024, provides for an exclusion from the calculation of consolidated EBITDA, through maturity, of certain charges and expenses. The credit agreement amendment reset the starting date for purposes of calculating such permitted exclusions related to restructuring charges and restructuring-related expenses from December 31, 2022 to March 31, 2024. Permitted exclusions include up to $500 million in cash and non-cash restructuring charges and restructuring-related expenses associated with our current or future restructuring plans. As of March 31, 2025, we had $274 million of the restructuring charge exclusion remaining. In addition, any cash litigation payments (net of any cash litigation receipts), as defined by the agreement, are excluded from the calculation of consolidated EBITDA, provided that the sum of any excluded net cash litigation payments do not exceed $1.000 billion plus all accrued legal liabilities as of December 31, 2022. As of March 31, 2025, we had $1.429 billion of the litigation exclusion remaining.

Contractual Obligations and Commitments
On March 3, 2025, we announced our entry into a definitive agreement to acquire SoniVie Ltd. (SoniVie), a privately held medical device company that has developed the TIVUS™ Intravascular Ultrasound System. The TIVUS system is designed to denervate nerves surrounding blood vessels to treat a variety of hypertensive disorders, including renal artery denervation for hypertension. We have been an investor in SoniVie since 2022 and currently hold an equity stake of approximately 10 percent. The transaction price to acquire the remaining stake is expected to result in an upfront cash payment of approximately $360 million upon closing and up to an additional $180 million in a future payment upon achievement of a regulatory milestone. The transaction is expected to close during the second quarter of 2025, subject to customary closing conditions. We plan to fund the acquisition through a mix of cash on hand and commercial paper. The SoniVie business will be integrated into our Cardiology division.
Certain of our acquisitions involve the payment of contingent consideration. Refer to
Note B – Acquisitions and Strategic Investments
to our unaudited consolidated financial statements contained in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further details regarding the estimated potential amount of future contingent consideration we could be required to pay associated with our acquisitions. There have been no other material changes to our contractual obligations and commitments as of March 31, 2025.
Equity
We received $115 million during the first quarter of 2025 and $80 million during the first quarter of 2024 in proceeds from stock issuances related to our stock option and employee stock purchase plans. Proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options and employee stock purchases vary from period to period based upon, among other factors, fluctuations in the trading price of our common stock and in the exercise and stock purchase patterns of our employees.
We did not repurchase any shares of our common stock during the first quarter of 2025 or 2024. On December 14, 2020, our Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase program authorizing the repurchase of up to $1.000 billion of our common stock. As of March 31, 2025, we had the full amount remaining available under the authorization.

Additional Information
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
To supplement our unaudited consolidated financial statements presented on a GAAP basis, we disclose certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted net income (loss), adjusted net income (loss) attributable to Boston Scientific common stockholders and adjusted net income (loss) per share (EPS) that exclude certain charges (credits); operational net sales, which exclude the impact of foreign currency fluctuations; and organic net sales, which exclude the impact of foreign currency fluctuations as well as the impact of certain acquisitions and divestitures with less than a full period of comparable net sales. These non-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should not be considered in isolation from or as a replacement for the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. Further, other companies may calculate these non-GAAP financial measures differently than we do, which may limit the usefulness of those measures for comparative purposes.
42
Table of Contents
To calculate adjusted net income (loss), adjusted net income (loss) attributable to Boston Scientific common stockholders and adjusted net income (loss) per share, we exclude certain charges (credits) from GAAP net income and GAAP net income attributable to Boston Scientific common stockholders, which include amortization expense, goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges, acquisition/divestiture-related net charges (credits), investment portfolio net losses (gains) and impairments, restructuring and restructuring-related net charges (credits), certain litigation-related net charges (credits), EU MDR implementation costs, debt extinguishment net charges, deferred tax expenses (benefits) and certain discrete tax items. Amounts are presented after-tax using our effective tax rate, unless the amount is a significant unusual or infrequently occurring item in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic 740-270-30, “General Methodology and Use of Estimated Annual Effective Tax Rate.” Please refer to Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission for an explanation of each of these adjustments and the reasons for excluding each item.
The GAAP financial measures most directly comparable to adjusted net income (loss), adjusted net income (loss) attributable to Boston Scientific common stockholders and adjusted net income (loss) per share are GAAP net income (loss), GAAP net income (loss) attributable to Boston Scientific common stockholders and GAAP net income (loss) per common share – diluted, respectively.
To calculate operational net sales growth rates, which exclude the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, we convert actual net sales from local currency to U.S. dollars using constant foreign currency exchange rates in the current and prior periods. To calculate organic net sales growth rates, we also remove the impact of certain acquisitions and divestitures with less than a full period of comparable net sales. The GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to operational net sales and organic net sales is net sales reported on a GAAP basis.
Reconciliations of each of these non-GAAP financial measures to the corresponding GAAP financial measure are included in the relevant sections of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
Management uses these supplemental non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate performance period over period, to analyze the underlying trends in our business, to assess our performance relative to our competitors and to establish operational goals and forecasts that are used in allocating resources. In addition, management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to further its understanding of the performance of our operating segments. The adjustments excluded from our non-GAAP financial measures are consistent with those excluded from our operating segments’ measures of net sales and profit or loss. These adjustments are excluded from the segment measures reported to our chief operating decision maker that are used to make operating decisions and assess performance.
We believe that presenting adjusted net income (loss), adjusted net income (loss) attributable to Boston Scientific common stockholders, adjusted net income (loss) per share, operational net sales growth rates and organic net sales growth rates, in addition to the corresponding GAAP financial measures, provides investors greater transparency to the information used by management for its operational decision-making and allows investors to see our results “through the eyes” of management. We further believe that providing this information assists our investors in understanding our operating performance and the methodology used by management to evaluate and measure such performance.
Safe Harbor for Forward-Looking Statements
Certain statements that we may make from time to time, including statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and information incorporated by reference herein, constitute “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

ITEM 3.
QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
We develop, manufacture and sell medical devices globally and our earnings and cash flows are exposed to market risk from changes in currency exchange rates and interest rates. We address these risks through a risk management program that includes the use of derivative financial instruments. We operate the program pursuant to documented corporate risk management policies. We do not enter derivative transactions for speculative purposes. Gains and losses on derivative financial instruments substantially offset losses and gains on underlying hedged exposures. Furthermore, we manage our exposure to counterparty risk on derivative instruments by entering into contracts with a diversified group of major financial institutions and by actively monitoring outstanding positions.
Our currency risk consists primarily of foreign currency denominated firm commitments, forecasted foreign currency denominated intercompany and third-party transactions and net investments in certain subsidiaries. We use both nonderivative (primarily European manufacturing operations) and derivative instruments to manage our earnings and cash flow exposure to changes in currency exchange rates. We had currency derivative instruments outstanding in the contract amount of $9.546 billion as of March 31, 2025 and $7.636 billion as of December 31, 2024. A ten percent appreciation in the U.S. dollar’s value relative to the hedged currencies would increase the derivative instruments’ fair value by $554 million as of March 31, 2025 compared to $322 million as of December 31, 2024. A ten percent depreciation in the U.S. dollar’s value relative to the hedged currencies would decrease the derivative instruments’ fair value by $676 million as of March 31, 2025 compared to $394 million as of December 31, 2024. Any increase or decrease in the fair value of our currency exchange rate sensitive derivative instruments would be substantially offset by a corresponding decrease or increase in the fair value of the hedged underlying asset, liability or forecasted transaction, resulting in minimal impacts on our unaudited consolidated statements of operations.
Our interest rate risk relates primarily to U.S. dollar and euro-denominated borrowings partially offset by U.S. dollar cash investments. We have historically used interest rate derivative instruments to manage our earnings and cash flow exposure to changes in interest rates. We had no interest rate derivative instruments outstanding as of March 31, 2025 or December 31, 2024. As of March 31, 2025, $11.243 billion in aggregate principal amount of our outstanding debt obligations was at fixed interest rates, representing approximately 100 percent of our total debt, on an amortized cost basis. As of March 31, 2025, our outstanding debt obligations at fixed interest rates were comprised of senior notes.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Our management, with the participation of our President and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer (CFO), evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of March 31, 2025 pursuant to Rule 13a-15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that material information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms and ensure that such material information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on their evaluation, our CEO and CFO concluded that, as of March 31, 2025, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
During 2022, we began a multi-year implementation of a new global enterprise resource planning (ERP) system, which will replace our existing system. The implementation is expected to occur in phases over the next several years. The portion of the transition to the new ERP system which we have completed to date resulted in changes in our internal control over financial reporting. No changes occurred during the first quarter of 2025. As future phases are implemented, we expect the changes to have a material impact on our internal controls over financial reporting and we will evaluate whether these process changes necessitate further changes in the design of and testing for effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting.
