Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Linde plc ("Linde" or "the company") is an incorporated public limited company formed under the laws of Ireland. Linde’s registered office is located at Ten Earlsfort Terrace, Dublin 2, D02 T380 Ireland. Linde’s principal executive offices are located at Forge, 43 Church Street West, Woking, Surrey GU21 6HT, United Kingdom and 10 Riverview Drive, Danbury, Connecticut, 06810, United States.
Presentation of Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
-
In the opinion of Linde management, the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements include all adjustments necessary for a fair statement of the results for the interim periods presented and such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature. The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the notes to the consolidated financial statements of Linde plc and subsidiaries in Linde's 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K. There have been no material changes to the company’s significant accounting policies during 2025.
Reclassifications
– Certain prior periods' amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year’s presentation.
Accounting Standards to be Implemented
Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures
- In December 2023, the FASB issued guidance requiring enhanced disclosure related to income taxes. The standard requires additional or modified disclosures related to the income tax rate reconciliation, disaggregation of income taxes paid, and several other disclosures. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. The adoption of this standard will only impact disclosures within the company's consolidated financial statements and the company is evaluating the impact this guidance will have on those disclosures. Linde will adopt this guidance for fiscal year 2025.
Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses
- In November 2024, the FASB issued guidance requiring disaggregated disclosure of income statement expenses. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim periods with fiscal years after December 15, 2027, with early adoption permitted. The adoption of this standard will only impact disclosures within the company's consolidated financial statements and the company is evaluating the impact this guidance will have on those disclosures.

Supplemental Information
Receivables
Linde applies loss rates that are lifetime expected credit losses at initial recognition of the receivables. These expected loss rates are based on an analysis of the actual historical default rates for each business, taking regional circumstances into account. If necessary, these historical default rates are adjusted to reflect the impact of current changes in the macroeconomic environment using forward-looking information. The loss rates are also evaluated based on the expectations of the responsible management team regarding the collectability of the receivables.
Gross trade receivables aged less than one year were $
4,847
million and $
4,573
million at March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively, and gross receivables aged greater than one year were $
351
million and $
322
million at March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively.
Other receivables were $
172
million and $
148
million at March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively. Receivables aged greater than one year are generally fully reserved unless specific circumstances warrant exceptions, such as those backed by federal governments.
Accounts receivable net of reserves were $
4,950
million at March 31, 2025 and $
4,622
million at December 31, 2024. Allowances for expected credit losses were $
420
million at March 31, 2025 and $
421
million at December 31, 2024.  Provisions for expected credit losses were $
42
million and $
44
million for the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively. The allowance activity in the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024 related to write-offs of uncollectible amounts, net of recoveries and currency movements is not material.

Financial Instruments
In its normal operations, Linde is exposed to market risks relating to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, energy and commodity costs. The objective of financial risk management at Linde is to minimize the negative impact of such fluctuations on the company’s earnings and cash flows. To manage these risks, among other strategies, Linde routinely enters into various derivative financial instruments (“derivatives”) including interest-rate swap and treasury rate lock agreements, forward contracts, and commodity-swap agreements. These instruments are not entered into for trading purposes and Linde only uses commonly traded and non-leveraged instruments.
There are
three
types of derivatives that the company enters into: (i) those relating to fair-value exposures, (ii) those relating to cash-flow exposures, and (iii) those relating to foreign currency net investment exposures. Fair-value exposures relate to recognized assets or liabilities, and firm commitments; cash-flow exposures relate to the variability of future cash flows associated with recognized assets or liabilities, or forecasted transactions; and net investment exposures relate to the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes on the carrying value of net assets denominated in foreign currencies.
When a derivative is executed and hedge accounting is appropriate, it is designated as either a fair-value hedge, cash-flow hedge, or a net investment hedge. Currently, Linde designates all interest-rate and treasury-rate locks as hedges for accounting purposes when used; however, currency contracts are generally not designated as hedges for accounting purposes. Certain currency contracts related to forecasted transactions are designated as hedges for accounting purposes. Whether designated as hedges for accounting purposes or not, all derivatives are linked to an appropriate underlying exposure. On an ongoing basis, the company assesses the hedge effectiveness of all derivatives designated as hedges for accounting purposes to determine if they continue to be highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of the underlying hedged items. If it is determined that the hedge is not highly effective through the use of a qualitative assessment, then hedge accounting will be discontinued prospectively.
Counterparties to Linde's derivatives are major banking institutions with credit ratings of investment grade or better. The company has Credit Support Annexes ("CSAs") in place for certain entities with their principal counterparties to minimize potential default risk and to mitigate counterparty risk. Under the CSAs, the fair values of derivatives for the purpose of interest rate and currency management are collateralized with cash on a regular basis. As of March 31, 2025, the impact of such collateral posting arrangements on the fair value of derivatives was insignificant. Management believes the risk of incurring losses on derivative contracts related to credit risk is remote and any losses would be immaterial.

The following table is a summary of the notional amount and fair value of derivatives outstanding at March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024 for consolidated subsidiaries:
(a)
Amounts as of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively, included current assets of $
141
million and $
302
million which are recorded in prepaid and other current assets; long-term assets of $
7
million and $
4
million which are recorded in other long-term assets; current liabilities of $
84
million and $
92
million which are recorded in other current liabilities; and long-term liabilities of $
8
million and $
9
million which are recorded in other long-term liabilities.
In addition, during 2024, Linde issued credit default swaps (“CDS”) to third-party financial institutions. The CDS relate to secured borrowings provided by the financial institutions to a government customer in Mexico, that were utilized to pay certain of Linde’s outstanding receivables. The notional amount of the CDS, which was $
167
million and $
166
million for the two programs as of March 31, 2025, will reduce on a monthly basis over their respective
24
-month and
22
-month terms. As of March 31, 2025, the fair value of the derivative liabilities was not material.
Balance Sheet Items
Foreign currency contracts related to balance sheet items consist of forward contracts entered into to manage the exposure to fluctuations in foreign-currency exchange rates on recorded balance sheet assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other                                  than the functional currency of the related operating unit. Certain forward currency contracts are entered into to protect underlying monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies from foreign exchange risk and are not designated as hedging instruments. For balance sheet items that are not designated as hedging instruments, the fair value adjustments on these contracts are offset by the fair value adjustments recorded on the underlying monetary assets and liabilities.
Forecasted Transactions
Foreign currency contracts related to forecasted transactions consist of forward contracts entered into to manage the exposure to fluctuations in foreign-currency exchange rates on (1) forecasted purchases of capital-related equipment and services, (2) forecasted sales, or (3) other forecasted cash flows denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the related operating units. For forecasted transactions that are designated as cash flow hedges, fair value adjustments are recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) with deferred amounts reclassified to earnings over the same time period as the income statement impact of the associated purchase. For forecasted transactions that do not qualify for cash flow hedging relationships, fair value adjustments are recorded directly to earnings. Linde is hedging forecasted transactions for a maximum period of
three years
.
Commodity Contracts
Commodity contracts are entered into to manage the exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices, which arise in the normal course of business from its procurement transactions. To reduce the extent of this risk, Linde enters into a limited number of electricity, natural gas, and propane gas derivatives. For forecasted transactions that are designated as cash flow hedges, fair value adjustments are recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) with deferred amounts reclassified to
11
earnings over the same time period as the income statement impact of the associated purchase. Linde is hedging commodity contracts for a maximum period of
three years

Net Investment Hedges
Foreign Currency-Denominated Debt Designations
As of March 31, 2025, Linde has €
19.7
billion ($
20.4
billion) Euro-denominated notes and intercompany loans, ¥
4.6
billion ($
0.6
billion) CNY-denominated intercompany loans and C$
1.4
billion ($
1.0
billion) CAD-denominated intercompany loans that are designated as hedges of the net investment positions in certain foreign operations. Since hedge inception, the deferred gain recorded within the cumulative translation adjustment component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the consolidated balance sheet is $
287
million (deferred loss of $
933
million in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income for the three months ended March 31, 2025), which is largely offset by an offsetting loss or gain on the underlying foreign net investment being hedged.
Foreign Currency Forward Exchange Contract Designations
In 2024, the Company entered into forward exchange contracts to partially hedge its net investment in certain foreign-denominated subsidiaries. The Company assesses the forward exchange contracts used as net investment hedges under the spot method. This results in the difference between the spot rate and the forward rate of the forward exchange contract being excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recorded as incurred as a reduction in interest expense - net in the consolidated statement of income. Since hedge inception, the deferred gain recorded within the cumulative translation adjustment component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the consolidated balance sheet is $
2
million (deferred loss of $
28
million in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income for the three months ended March 31, 2025), which is largely offset by an offsetting loss or gain on the underlying foreign net investment being hedged. The amount of net interest income recorded in three months ended March 31, 2025 for all forward exchange contracts was immaterial.
Effects of Previous Hedge Designations
As of March 31, 2025, exchange rate movements relating to previously designated hedges that remain in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) is a gain of $
56
million. These movements will remain in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), until appropriate, such as upon sale or liquidation of the related foreign operations at which time amounts will be reclassified to the consolidated statement of income.
Interest Rate Swaps
Linde has historically used interest rate swaps to hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities as a result of interest rate changes. When used, these interest rate swaps would effectively convert fixed-rate interest exposures to variable rates; fair value adjustments were recognized in earnings along with an equally offsetting charge/benefit to earnings for the changes in the fair value of the underlying financial asset or financial liability (See Note 3).
Derivatives' Impact on Consolidated Statement of Income
The following table summarizes the impact of the company’s derivatives on the consolidated statement of income:
* The gains (losses) on balance sheet items are offset by gains (losses) recorded on the underlying hedged assets and liabilities. Accordingly, the gains (losses) for the derivatives and the underlying hedged assets and liabilities related to debt items are recorded in the consolidated statement of income as interest expense-net. Other balance sheet items and anticipated net income gains (losses) are generally recorded in the consolidated statement of income as other income (expenses)-net.
12
The amounts of gain or loss recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and reclassified to the consolidated statement of income was not material for the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024. Net impacts expected to be reclassified to earnings during the next twelve months are also not material.
5.
Fair Value Disclosures
The fair value hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels as follows:
Level 1 – quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
Level 2 – quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs that are observable
Level 3 – inputs that are unobservable (for example cash flow modeling inputs based on assumptions)
Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis
The following table summarizes assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis:
* Investments and securities are recorded in prepaid and other current assets and other long-term assets in the company's condensed consolidated balance sheet.
Level 1 investments and securities are marketable securities traded on an exchange. Level 2 investments are based on market prices obtained from independent brokers or determined using quantitative models that use as their basis readily observable market parameters that are actively quoted and can be validated through external sources, including third-party pricing services, brokers and market transactions. Level 3 investments and securities consist of a venture fund. For the valuation, Linde uses the net asset value received as part of the fund's quarterly reporting, which for the most part is not based on quoted prices in active markets. In order to reflect current market conditions, Linde proportionally adjusts by observable market data (stock exchange prices) or current transaction prices.
Changes in level 3 investments and securities were immaterial.
The fair value of cash and cash equivalents, short-term debt, accounts receivable-net, and accounts payable approximate carrying value because of the short-term maturities of these instruments.
The fair value of long-term debt is estimated based on the quoted market prices for the same or similar issues. Long-term debt is categorized within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. At March 31, 2025, the estimated fair value of Linde’s long-term debt portfolio was $
17,965
million versus a carrying value of $
19,432
million. At December 31, 2024, the estimated fair value of Linde’s long-term debt portfolio was $
16,234
million versus a carrying value of $
17,400
million. Differences between the carrying value and the fair value are attributable to fluctuations in interest rates subsequent to when the debt was issued and relative to stated coupon rates.

Commitments and Contingencies
Contingent Liabilities
Linde is subject to various lawsuits and government investigations that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business. These actions are based upon alleged environmental, tax, antitrust and personal injury claims, among others. Linde has strong defenses in these cases and intends to defend itself vigorously. It is possible that the company may incur losses in connection with some of these actions in excess of accrued liabilities. Management does not anticipate that in the aggregate such losses would have a material adverse effect on the company’s consolidated financial position or liquidity; however, it is possible that the final outcomes could have a significant impact on the company’s reported results of operations in any given period.

Significant matters are:
•
During 2009, the Brazilian government published Law 11941/2009 instituting a new voluntary amnesty program (“Refis Program”) which allowed Brazilian companies to settle certain federal tax disputes at reduced amounts. During 2009, the company decided that it was economically beneficial to settle many of its outstanding federal tax disputes and such disputes were enrolled in the Refis Program, subject to final calculation and review by the Brazilian federal government. The company recorded estimated liabilities based on the terms of the Refis Program. Since 2009, Linde has been unable to reach final agreement on the calculations and initiated litigation against the government in an attempt to resolve certain items. Open issues relate to the following matters: (i) application of cash deposits and net operating loss carryforwards to satisfy obligations and (ii) the amount of tax reductions available under the Refis Program. It is difficult to estimate the timing of resolution of legal matters in Brazil.

On and after April 23, 2019 former shareholders of Linde AG filed appraisal proceedings at the District Court (
Landgericht
) Munich I (Germany), seeking an increase of the cash consideration paid in connection with the previously completed cash merger squeeze-out of all of Linde AG’s minority shareholders for €
189.46
per share. Any such increase would apply to all
14,763,113
Linde AG shares that were outstanding on April 8, 2019, when the cash merger squeeze-out was completed. The period for plaintiffs to file claims expired on July 9, 2019. In November 2023, the court issued a decision rejecting the plaintiffs’ claims in their entirety and determining that the cash merger squeeze-out consideration was appropriate. The plaintiffs have appealed this decision.
The company believes the consideration paid was fair and that the claims are not supported by sufficient evidence, and no reserve has been established. We cannot estimate the timing of resolution.

On May 27, 2022, performance of all Linde Engineering agreements in Russia were lawfully suspended in compliance with applicable sanctions. In December 2022, at RusChemAlliance’s (RCA) request a Russian St. Petersburg court (“St. Petersburg Court”) issued an injunction preventing sale of Linde Russia subsidiaries and assets. During 2023 and 2024, in accordance with the dispute resolution provisions of the related engineering agreements Linde secured judgements reenforcing jurisdiction of the agreements with RCA outside of Russia and ordering the St. Petersburg proceedings stayed and injunctions lifted. However, RCA has continued to pursue its claims in Russia and during the fourth quarter of 2024 two Linde Russian joint ventures were sold locally pursuant to a St. Petersburg court order and the proceeds provided to RCA. Linde does not expect a material adverse impact on earnings given the $
1.8
billion liabilities recorded as of March 31, 2025 and the immaterial investment value of its remaining deconsolidated Russia subsidiaries. Please see further detail on the Russia legal cases below.
RCA LNG and GPP
In December 2022, the St. Petersburg Court issued an injunction preventing (i) the sale of any shares in Linde’s subsidiaries and joint ventures in Russia, and (ii) the disposal of any of the assets in those entities exceeding
5
% of the relevant company’s overall asset value. RusChemAlliance is owned
50
% by PJSC Gazprom. The injunction was requested by RCA to secure payment of a possible award under an arbitration proceeding RCA intended to file against Linde Engineering for alleged breach of contract under the agreement to build a gas processing plant in Russia entered into in July 2021. In March 2023, RCA filed a claim in St. Petersburg against Linde GmbH for recovery of advance payments under the agreement ("GPP Claim"), and subsequently (i) added Linde and other Linde subsidiaries as defendants, and (ii) is seeking payment of alleged damages from Linde and guarantor banks.  In March 2024, RCA filed a similar claim for repayment and damages against Linde for alleged breach of contract under the agreement to build a liquefied natural gas plant in Russia entered into in September 2021 (“LNG Claim”, and together with the GPP Claim, the “Russian Claims”).
Dispute resolution provisions
In accordance with the dispute resolution provisions of the agreements, in 2023, Linde filed a notice of arbitration with the Hong Kong International Arbitration Centre ("HKIAC") against RCA to claim that (i) RCA has no entitlement to payment, (ii) RCA’s Russian Claims are in breach of the arbitration agreement which requires HKIAC arbitration, and (iii) RCA must compensate Linde for the losses and damages caused by the injunction. During 2024, Linde secured awards on exclusive jurisdiction with HKIAC.
In January 2024, the Hong Kong court issued a final judgment in Linde’s favor (i) granting a permanent anti-suit injunction against RCA to seek a stay of the GPP claim and not start an LNG claim, (ii) granting a permanent, global anti-enforcement injunction against RCA for the GPP claim, and (iii) ordering that the injunction issued by the St. Petersburg Court be lifted (“HK Court Judgement”).
Despite the judgments of the Hong Kong court and similar orders issued by the HKIAC arbitration tribunals, RCA is continuing to pursue its claims in Russia and neither the St. Petersburg injunction affecting Linde’s shares and assets has been lifted, nor the proceeding in St. Petersburg been stayed.

Local seizures
In February 2024, the St. Petersburg Court decided the GPP Claim in favor of RCA (the “GPP Decision”) and in October 2024, decided the LNG Claim in favor of RCA (the “LNG Decision”). Linde unsuccessfully appealed the GPP Decision in March and September 2024. During the fourth quarter of 2024, RCA executed enforcement actions related to the GPP Decision within Russia for Linde’s shares in two Linde Russian joint ventures and locally RCA received payment from the purchase of these shares by Linde’s joint venture partners. RCA previously initiated the enforcement process for the GPP Decision within Russia for the remainder of Linde’s local assets, and these proceedings are currently pending a court appointed local valuation of Linde’s assets. Additionally, during November 2024, RCA seized the ruble equivalent of approximately €
238
million from one of the guarantor bank’s accounts in Russia.
Linde intends to claim all damages related to or rising from RCA's enforcement of the GPP and LNG Decisions in the HKIAC arbitration proceedings.  Linde subsidiaries affected by the GPP Decision have also filed claims for damages against RCA in the Southern District of New York, the Netherlands and Germany.
As of March 31, 2025, Linde has a contingent liability of $
1.1
billion, which represents advance payments previously recorded in contract liabilities related to terminated engineering projects with RCA. As a result of the contract terminations, Linde no longer has future performance obligations for these projects.
It is difficult to estimate the timing of resolution of these matters. The company intends to vigorously defend its interests in the Russian Claims, Hong Kong arbitration proceedings and other jurisdictions.
Amur GPP
In July 2015, Gazprom Pererabotka Blagoveshchensk LLC ("Gazprom") entered into an engineering, procurement and construction contract with OJSC NIPIgazpererabotka ("Nipigas") for the construction of a gas processing plant and other components located in the Amur Region, Russia (“Amur GPP”). Subsequently, in December 2015, Nipigas and Linde Engineering, executed a subcontract for engineering, procurement, and site services for licensed production units for the Amur GPP project. Additionally, Linde also entered into (i) a license agreement with Gazprom in 2017 for the operation of the plants, and (ii) a direct owner agreement with Gazprom and Nipigas which included limitation of liability provisions. Performance of the Amur GPP agreements were lawfully suspended in compliance with applicable sanctions on May 27, 2022.
On October 8, 2021 and January 5, 2022, fires occurred at the Amur GPP facility. Following the initial fire in 2021, Linde undertook a comprehensive review of the incident, including a detailed local inspection conducted by Linde employees. The Linde report concluded that the fire was attributable to the quality of construction and assembly work, responsibilities falling under the scope of Nipigas. On October 29, 2024, Gazprom submitted a claim to the Arbitration State Court in the Amur Region, Russia (“Amur Court”) against Linde claiming damages and lost profits arising from the fire incidents.
As of March 31, 2025, Linde has a contingent liability of $
0.7
billion for this and other Amur GPP contract matters. It is difficult to estimate the timing of resolution of this matter. The company intends to vigorously defend its interests in this case.

Revenue Recognition
Revenue is accounted for in accordance with ASC 606. Revenue is recognized as control of goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for the goods or services.
Contracts with Customers
Linde serves a diverse group of industries including healthcare, chemicals and energy, manufacturing, metals and mining, food
18
Table of Contents
and beverage, and electronics.
Industrial Gases
Within each of the company’s geographic segments for industrial gases, there are
three
basic distribution methods: (i) on-site or tonnage; (ii) merchant or bulk liquid; and (iii) packaged or cylinder gases. The distribution method used by Linde to supply a customer is determined by many factors, including the customer’s volume requirements and location. The distribution method generally determines the contract terms with the customer and, accordingly, the revenue recognition accounting practices. Linde's primary products in its industrial gases business are atmospheric gases (oxygen, nitrogen, argon, rare gases) and process gases (hydrogen, helium, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, electronic gases, specialty gases, acetylene). These products are generally sold through one of the
three
distribution methods.
Following is a description of each of the
three
industrial gases distribution methods and the respective revenue recognition policies
:
On-site.
Customers that require the largest volumes of product and that have a relatively constant demand pattern are supplied by cryogenic and process gas on-site plants. Linde constructs plants on or adjacent to these customers’ sites and supplies the product directly to customers by pipeline. Where there are large concentrations of customers, a single pipeline may be connected to several plants and customers. On-site product supply contracts generally are total requirement contracts with terms typically ranging from
10
-
20
years and contain minimum purchase requirements and price escalation provisions. Many of the cryogenic on-site plants also produce liquid products for the merchant market. Therefore, plants are typically not dedicated to a single customer. Additionally, Linde is responsible for the design, construction, operations and maintenance of the plants and our customers typically have no involvement in these activities. Advanced air separation processes also allow on-site delivery to customers with smaller volume requirements.
The company’s performance obligations related to on-site customers are satisfied over time as customers receive and obtain control of the product. Linde has elected to apply the practical expedient for measuring progress towards the completion of a performance obligation and recognizes revenue as the company has the right to invoice each customer, which generally corresponds with product delivery. Accordingly, revenue is recognized when product is delivered to the customer and the company has the right to invoice the customer in accordance with the contract terms. Consideration in these contracts is generally based on pricing which fluctuates with various price indices. Variable components of consideration exist within on-site contracts but are considered constrained.
Merchant.
Merchant deliveries generally are made from Linde's plants by tanker trucks to storage containers at the customer's site.  Due to the relatively high distribution cost, merchant oxygen and nitrogen generally have a relatively small distribution radius from the plants at which they are produced. Merchant argon, hydrogen and helium can be shipped much longer distances. The customer agreements used in the merchant business are usually
three
-to
seven-year
supply agreements based on the requirements of the customer. These contracts generally do not contain minimum purchase requirements or volume commitments.
The company’s performance obligations related to merchant customers are generally satisfied at a point in time as the customers receive and obtain control of the product. Revenue is recognized when product is delivered to the customer and the company has the right to invoice the customer in accordance with the contract terms.
Packaged Gases.
Customers requiring small volumes are supplied products in containers called cylinders, under medium to high pressure. Linde distributes merchant gases from its production plants to company-owned cylinder filling plants where cylinders are then filled for distribution to customers. Cylinders may be delivered to the customer’s site or picked up by the customer at a packaging facility or retail store. Linde invoices the customer for the industrial gases and the use of the cylinder container(s). The company also sells hardgoods and welding equipment purchased from independent manufacturers. Packaged gases are generally sold under
one
to
three-year
supply contracts and purchase orders and do not contain minimum purchase requirements or volume commitments.
The company’s performance obligations related to packaged gases are satisfied at a point in time. Accordingly, revenue is recognized when product is delivered to the customer or when the customer picks up product from a packaged gas facility or retail store and the company has the right to payment from the customer in accordance with the contract terms.
Engineering
The company designs and manufactures equipment for air separation and other industrial gas applications manufactured specifically for end customers. Sale of equipment contracts are generally comprised of a single performance obligation. Revenue from sale of equipment is generally recognized over time as Linde has an enforceable right to payment for
19
Table of Contents
performance completed to date and performance does not create an asset with alternative use. For contracts recognized over time, revenue is recognized primarily using a cost incurred input method. Costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion are used to measure progress toward satisfying performance obligations. Costs incurred include material, labor, and overhead costs and represent work contributing and proportionate to the transfer of control to the customer. Changes to cost estimates and contract modifications are typically accounted for as part of the existing contract and are recognized as cumulative adjustments for the inception-to-date effect of such change.
Contract Assets and Liabilities
Contract assets and liabilities result from differences in timing of revenue recognition and customer invoicing. Contract assets primarily relate to sale of equipment contracts for which revenue is recognized over time. The balance represents unbilled revenue which occurs when revenue recognized under the measure of progress exceeds amounts invoiced to customers. Customer invoices may be based on the passage of time, the achievement of certain contractual milestones or a combination of both criteria. Contract liabilities include advance payments or right to consideration prior to performance under the contract. Contract liabilities are recognized as revenue as performance obligations are satisfied under contract terms. Linde has contract assets of  $
338
million at March 31, 2025 (current contract assets of $
293
million and $
45
million within other long-term assets in the condensed consolidated balance sheet). Total contract assets were $
263
million at December 31, 2024, all classified as current contract assets in the condensed consolidated balance sheet. Total contract liabilities are $
2,399
million at March 31, 2025 (current contract liabilities of $
1,196
million and $
1,203
million within other long-term liabilities in the condensed consolidated balance sheet). Total contract liabilities were $
2,292
million at December 31, 2024 (current contract liabilities of $
1,194
million and $
1,098
million within other long-term liabilities in the condensed consolidated balance sheet). Revenue recognized for the three months ended March 31, 2025 that was included in the contract liability at December 31, 2024 was $
380
million. Contract assets and liabilities primarily relate to the Engineering business and customer prepayments for certain on-site supply agreements.
Payment Terms and Other
Linde generally receives payment after performance obligations are satisfied, and customer prepayments are not typical for the industrial gases business. Payment terms vary based on the country where sales originate and local customary payment practices.  Linde does not offer extended financing outside of customary payment terms. Amounts billed for sales and use taxes, value-added taxes, and certain excise and other specific transactional taxes imposed on revenue producing transactions are presented on a net basis and are not included in sales within the consolidated statement of income. Additionally, sales returns and allowances are not a normal practice in the industry and are not significant.
Disaggregated Revenue Information
As described above and in Note 19 to Linde plc's 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K, the company manages its industrial gases business on a geographic basis, while the Engineering and Other businesses are generally managed on a global basis. Furthermore, the company believes that reporting sales by distribution method by reportable geographic segment best illustrates the nature, timing, type of customer, and contract terms for its revenues, including terms and pricing.
The following tables show sales by distribution method at the consolidated level and for each reportable segment and Other for the three months ended March 31, 2025, and March 31, 2024.

Table of Contents
Remaining Performance Obligations
As described above, Linde's contracts with on-site customers are under long-term supply arrangements which generally require the customer to purchase their requirements from Linde and also have minimum purchase requirements. Additionally, plant sales from the Linde Engineering business are primarily contracted on a fixed price basis. The company estimates the consideration related to future minimum purchase requirements and plant sales was approximately $
58
billion. This amount excludes all on-site sales above minimum purchase requirements, which can be significant depending on customer needs. In the future, actual amounts will be different due to impacts from several factors, many of which are beyond the company’s control including, but not limited to, timing of newly signed, terminated and renewed contracts, inflationary price escalations, currency exchange rates, and pass-through costs related to natural gas and electricity. The actual duration of long-term supply contracts ranges up to
twenty years
. The company estimates that approximately half of the revenue related to minimum purchase requirements will be earned in the next
six years
and the remaining thereafter.

Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ("MD&A")
Non-GAAP Measures
Throughout MD&A, the company provides adjusted operating results exclusive of certain items such as Cost reduction program and other charges, purchase accounting impacts of the Linde AG merger and pension settlement charges. Adjusted amounts are non-GAAP measures which are intended to supplement investors’ understanding of the company’s financial information by providing measures which investors, financial analysts and management find useful in evaluating the company’s operating performance.  Items which the company does not believe to be indicative of on-going business performance are excluded from these calculations so that investors can better evaluate and analyze historical and future business trends on a consistent basis.  In addition, operating results, excluding these items, is important to management's development of annual and long-term employee incentive compensation plans. Definitions of these non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similar definitions used by other companies and are not a substitute for similar GAAP measures.
The non-GAAP measures and reconciliations are separately included in a later section in the MD&A titled "Non-GAAP Measures and Reconciliations."

Reported
In the first quarter of 2025, Linde's sales were $8,112 million, flat versus prior year. Sales grew 2% from higher price attainment. Cost pass-through, representing the contractual billing of energy cost variances primarily to onsite customers, increased sales by 1% in the quarter, with minimal impact on operating profit. Acquisitions increased sales by 1% in the first quarter. Engineering sales were flat in the quarter. Currency translation decreased sales by 3% in the quarter driven primarily by the weakening of the Brazilian real, Mexican peso and Euro
against the U.S. dollar. Volumes decreased sales by 1% in the quarter versus the 2024 respective period, as base volume declines were partially offset by new project start-ups.
Reported operating profit for the first quarter of 2025 of $2,184 million, or 26.9% of sales, was 4% above prior year. The reported year-over-year increase was primarily driven by higher pricing and productivity initiatives which more than offset adverse impacts from cost inflation, cost reduction program and other charges and currency translation. The reported effective
23
Table of Contents
tax rate ("ETR") was 23.4% in the first quarter 2025 versus 22.3% in the first quarter 2024. This increase was primarily due to lower tax benefits from share based compensation in 2025. Diluted earnings per share ("EPS") was $3.51, or 5% above EPS of $3.35 in the first quarter of 2024, primarily due to higher net income - Linde plc and lower diluted shares outstanding.
Adjusted
In the first quarter of 2025, adjusted operating profit of $2,438 million, or 30.1% of sales, was 4% higher as compared to 2024, driven by higher pricing, and productivity initiatives, partially offset by cost inflation and currency translation. The adjusted ETR was 23.5% in the first quarter 2025 versus 22.7% in the respective 2024 quarter. This increase was primarily due to lower tax benefits from share based compensation in 2025. On an adjusted basis, EPS was $3.95, 5% above the 2024 adjusted EPS of $3.75, driven by higher adjusted net income - Linde plc and lower diluted shares outstanding.

Sales were flat for the first quarter of 2025 versus the respective 2024 period. Higher price attainment contributed 2% to sales in the quarter. Acquisitions increased sales by 1% in the quarter. Cost pass-through increased sales by 1% in the quarter, with minimal impact on operating profit. Engineering sales were flat in the quarter. Currency translation decreased sales by 3% in the quarter primarily driven by weakening of the Brazilian real, Mexican peso and Euro
against the U.S. dollar. Volume decreased sales by 1% in the quarter versus the respective 2024 period, as base volume declines were partially offset by new project start-ups.
Cost of sales, exclusive of depreciation and amortization
Cost of sales, exclusive of depreciation and amortization decreased $59 million, or 1%, for the first quarter of 2025 primarily due to productivity gains and lower volumes, which more than offset cost inflation. Cost of sales, exclusive of depreciation and amortization was 51.2% of sales for the first quarter versus 52.0% for the respective 2024 period. The decrease as a percentage of sales in the quarter was primarily due to higher pricing and productivity gains.
Selling, general and administrative expenses
Selling, general and administrative expense ("SG&A") decreased $74 million, or 9%, for the first quarter of 2025 driven by lower costs, restructuring programs, productivity initiatives and currency. Currency impacts decreased SG&A by approximately $18 million. SG&A was
9.7% of  first quarter sales versus 10.6% of the respective 2024 period.
Depreciation and amortization
Reported depreciation and amortization expense decreased $39 million for the first quarter of 2025, primarily due to lower depreciation and amortization of assets acquired in the merger partially offset by the net impact of new project start ups.
On an adjusted basis, depreciation and amortization increased $10 million, for the first quarter of 2025. Currency impacts decreased depreciation and amortization by $16 million. Excluding currency, the underlying depreciation and amortization increase was driven largely by new project start ups.
Cost reduction program and other charges
Cost reduction program and other charges were $55 million for the first quarter of 2025, primarily related to severance charges.  On an adjusted basis, these costs have been excluded. There were no charges during the respective 2024 period.
Other income (expense) - net
Reported other income (expense) - net was a benefit of $18 million for the first quarter of 2025 versus benefit of $58 million for the respective 2024 period. 2024 other income included a benefit of $43 million in insurance recoveries primarily within the Other segment.

Operating profit
On a reported basis, operating profit increased $89 million, or 4%, for the first quarter of 2025. The increase in the quarter was primarily due to higher pricing and savings from productivity initiatives which more than offset the adverse impacts of cost inflation, cost reduction program and other charges, lower volumes, and currency.
On an adjusted basis, which excludes the impacts of merger-related purchase accounting as well as cost reduction programs and other charges, operating profit increased $97 million, or 4% in the first quarter of 2025. Operating profit growth was driven by higher pricing and productivity initiatives, which more than offset the effects of cost inflation, lower volumes and currency during the first quarter of 2025. A discussion of operating profit by segment is included in the segment discussion that follows.
Interest expense - net
Reported interest expense - net decreased $5 million for the first quarter of 2025.
Net pension and OPEB cost (benefit), excluding service cost
Reported net pension and OPEB cost (benefit), excluding service cost was a benefit of $56 million for the quarter, versus $50 million for the respective 2024 period. The increase in the benefit primarily relates to lower interest cost due to lower benefit obligations and higher amortization of deferred gains year-over-year, partially offset by lower expected return on plan assets.
Effective tax rate
The reported effective tax rate ("ETR") for the three months ended March 31, 2025 was 23.4% versus 22.3% for the respective 2024 period. On an adjusted basis, the ETR for the first quarter was 23.5% versus 22.7% for the respective 2024 period. The increase in the reported and adjusted ETR was primarily due to lower tax benefits from share based compensation in 2025.
Income from equity investments
Reported income from equity investments for the first quarter was $38 million versus $48 million for the respective 2024 period.
On an adjusted basis, income from equity investments for the first quarter was $56 million versus $66 million for the respective 2024 period.
Noncontrolling interests
At March 31, 2025, noncontrolling interests consisted primarily of non-controlling shareholders' investments in APAC (primarily China). Reported noncontrolling interests income was $34 million for the first quarter of 2025 and $38 million for the respective 2024 period.
Net Income – Linde plc
Reported net income - Linde plc increased $46 million, or 3%, for the first quarter of 2025 versus the respective 2024 period. On an adjusted basis, which excludes the impacts of purchase accounting and cost reduction program and other charges, net income - Linde plc increased $59 million, or 3%, for the first quarter of 2025 versus the respective 2024 period. On both a reported and adjusted basis, the increase was driven by higher operating profit.
Diluted earnings per share
Reported diluted earnings per share increased $0.16, or 5%, for the first quarter of 2025 versus the respective 2024 period. On an adjusted basis, diluted EPS increased $0.20 for the first quarter, or 5% versus the respective 2024 period. On both a reported and adjusted basis, the increase was primarily due to higher net income - Linde plc and lower diluted shares outstanding.
Employees
The number of employees at March 31, 2025 was 65,069, a decrease of 1,126 employees from March 31, 2024 primarily due to the ongoing impact of cost reduction programs.
Other Financial Data

Adjusted EBITDA increased to $3,213 million for the first quarter 2025 from $3,116 million in the respective 2024 period.

Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)
Other comprehensive income for the first quarter of 2025 was $131 million. The income in the quarter resulted primarily from currency translation adjustments of $134 million. The translation adjustments reflect the impact of translating local currency foreign subsidiary financial statements to U.S. dollars, and are largely driven by the movement of the U.S. dollar against major currencies including the Euro, British pound and the Chinese yuan. See the "Currency" section of the MD&A for exchange rates used for translation purposes and Note 10 to the condensed consolidated financial statements for a summary of the currency translation adjustment component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) by segment.

Cash Flow from Operations
Cash provided by operations of $2,161 million for the three months ended March 31, 2025 increased $207 million, or 11% versus 2024. The increase was driven primarily by higher net income adjusted for non-cash charges and lower net working capital requirements.
Linde estimates that total 2025 required contributions to its pension plans will be in the range of approximately $25 million to
$35 million
, of which $5 million has been made through March 31, 2025.
Investing
Net cash used for investing activities of $1,369 million for the three months ended March 31, 2025 increased $328 million versus 2024, due to higher capital expenditures and acquisition spend, net of cash acquired.

Cash dividends of $708 million increased $39 million from 2024 driven primarily by a 8% increase in quarterly dividends per share from $1.39 per share to $1.50 per share, partially offset by lower shares outstanding. Cash used for Noncontrolling interest transactions and other was $73 million for the three months ended March 31, 2025 versus cash used of  $189 million for the respective 2024 period primarily driven by lower cash requirements for financing related derivatives and withholding taxes related to share-based compensation arrangements.
