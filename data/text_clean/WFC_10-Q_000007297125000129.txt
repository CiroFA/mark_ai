FINANCIAL REVIEW
(1)
Pre-tax pre-provision profit (PTPP) is total revenue less noninterest expense. Management believes that PTPP is a useful financial measure because it enables investors and others to assess the Company’s ability to generate capital to cover credit losses through a credit cycle.

This Quarterly Report, including the Financial Review and the Financial Statements and related Notes, contains forward-looking statements, which may include forecasts of our financial results and condition, expectations for our operations and business, and our assumptions for those forecasts and expectations. Do not unduly rely on forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from our forward-looking statements due to several factors. Factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements are described in this Report, including in the “Forward-Looking Statements” section, and in the “Risk Factors” and “Regulation and Supervision” sections of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024 (2024 Form 10-K).
When we refer to “Wells Fargo,” “the Company,” “we,” “our,” or “us” in this Report, we mean Wells Fargo & Company and Subsidiaries (consolidated). When we refer to the “Parent,” we mean Wells Fargo & Company. See the “Glossary of Acronyms” for definitions of terms used throughout this Report.
Financial Review
Wells Fargo & Company is a leading financial services company that has approximately $1.95 trillion in assets. We provide a diversified set of banking, investment and mortgage products and services, as well as consumer and commercial finance, through our four reportable operating segments: Consumer Banking and Lending, Commercial Banking, Corporate and Investment Banking, and Wealth and Investment Management. Wells Fargo ranked No. 34 on Fortune’s 2024 rankings of America’s largest corporations. We ranked fourth in assets and third in the market value of our common stock among all U.S. banks at March 31, 2025.
Wells Fargo’s top priority remains building a risk and control infrastructure appropriate for its size and complexity. The Company is subject to a number of consent orders and other regulatory actions, which may require the Company, among
other things, to undertake certain changes to its business, operations, products and services, and risk management practices. While we still have work to do and have not yet satisfied certain aspects of these regulatory actions, the Company is committed to devoting the resources necessary to operate with strong business practices and controls, maintain the highest level of integrity, and have an appropriate culture in place. In particular, pursuant to a 2018 consent order entered into with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (FRB), we are subject to an asset cap whereby the Company’s total consolidated assets as defined under the consent order have been limited to the level as of December 31, 2017. For additional information regarding regulatory actions and the risks related thereto, including additional information on the asset cap, see the “Regulation and Supervision” section in this Report and the “Risk Factors” section in our 2024 Form 10-K.
Financial Performance
(1)
Includes provision for credit losses for loans, debt securities, and other financial assets.
In first quarter 2025, we generated $4.9 billion of net income and diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.39, compared with $4.6 billion of net income and diluted EPS of $1.20 in the same period a year ago. Financial performance for first quarter 2025, compared with first quarter 2024, included the following:
•
total revenue decreased due to lower net interest income, partially offset by higher noninterest income;
•
noninterest expense decreased due to lower operating losses, lower professional and outside services expense, and lower other expense driven by a lower Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) special assessment, partially offset by higher technology, telecommunications and equipment expense;
•
average loans decreased due to declines in our commercial real estate and residential mortgage portfolios; and
•
average deposits decreased driven by a decline in our interest-bearing deposits, partially offset by an increase in our noninterest-bearing deposits.
Capital and Liquidity
We maintained a strong capital and liquidity position in first quarter 2025, which included the following:
•
our Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio was 11.09% under the Standardized Approach (our binding ratio), which
Overview
(continued)
continued to exceed the regulatory minimum and buffers of 9.80%;
•
our total loss absorbing capacity (TLAC) as a percentage of total risk-weighted assets was 25.11%, compared with the regulatory minimum of 21.50%; and
•
our liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) was 125%, which continued to exceed the regulatory minimum of 100%.
See the “Capital Management” and the “Risk Management – Asset/Liability Management – Liquidity Risk and Funding” sections in this Report for additional information regarding our capital and liquidity, including the calculation of our regulatory capital and liquidity amounts.
Credit Quality
Credit quality reflected the following:
•
The allowance for credit losses (ACL) for loans of $14.6 billion at March 31, 2025, decreased $84 million from December 31, 2024.
•
Our provision for credit losses for loans was $925 million in first quarter 2025, compared with $926 million in the same period a year ago, reflecting a decrease in net loan charge-offs, which was partially offset by the change in allowance for credit losses for loans driven by a lower allowance for commercial real estate loans on lower loan balances, partially offset by a higher allowance for commercial and industrial loans.
•
The allowance coverage for total loans was 1.59% at March 31, 2025, compared with 1.60% at December 31, 2024.
•
Commercial portfolio net loan charge-offs were $211 million, or 16 basis points of average commercial loans, in first quarter 2025, compared with net loan charge-offs of $341 million, or 25 basis points, in the same period a year ago, due to lower losses in our commercial real estate portfolio driven by the office property type and lower losses in our commercial and industrial portfolio.
•
Consumer portfolio net loan charge-offs were $798 million, or 86 basis points of average consumer loans, in first quarter 2025, compared with net loan charge-offs of $808 million, or 84 basis points, in the same period a year ago, due to lower losses in our auto and other consumer portfolios, partially offset by higher losses in our credit card portfolio.
•
Nonperforming assets (NPAs) of $8.2 billion at March 31, 2025, increased $289 million, or 4%, from December 31, 2024, driven by an increase in commercial and industrial nonaccrual loans. NPAs represented 0.90% of total loans at March 31, 2025.
Wells Fargo net income for first quarter 2025 was $4.9 billion ($1.39 diluted EPS), compared with $4.6 billion ($1.20 diluted EPS) in the same period a year ago. Net income increased in first quarter 2025, compared with the same period a year ago, predominantly due to a $447 million decrease in noninterest expense and a $442 million
decrease in income tax expense, partially offset by a $732 million
decrease in net interest income.
Net Interest Income
Net interest income and net interest margin decreased in first quarter 2025, compared with the same period a year ago, driven by the impact of lower interest rates on floating rate assets, deposit mix and pricing changes, lower loan balances, and one fewer day in the quarter, partially offset by lower market funding costs.
Table 1 presents the individual components of net interest income and net interest margin. Net interest income and net interest margin are presented on a taxable-equivalent basis in Table 1 to consistently reflect income from taxable and tax-exempt loans and debt and equity securities. The calculation for taxable-equivalent basis was based on a federal statutory tax rate of 21%.
For additional information about net interest income and net interest margin, see the “Earnings Performance – Net Interest Income” section in our 2024 Form 10-K.

Table 1:
Average Balances, Yields and Rates Paid (Taxable-Equivalent Basis) (1)
(1)
The average balance amounts represent amortized costs, except for certain held-to-maturity (HTM) debt securities, which exclude unamortized basis adjustments related to the transfer of those securities from available-for-sale (AFS) debt securities. Amortized cost amounts exclude any valuation allowances and unrealized gains or losses, which are included in other noninterest-earning assets and other noninterest-bearing liabilities. The average interest rates are based on interest income or expense amounts for the period and are annualized. Interest rates and amounts include the effects of hedge and risk management activities associated with the respective asset and liability categories.
(2)
Nonaccrual loans and any related income are included in their respective loan categories.
(3)
Includes taxable-equivalent adjustments of $77 million and $89 million for the quarters ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively, predominantly related to tax-exempt income on certain loans and securities.
Noninterest Income

First quarter 2025 vs. first quarter 2024
Investment advisory and other asset-based
fees
increased driven by higher asset-based fees reflecting higher market valuations
.
Fees from the majority of Wealth and Investment Management (WIM) advisory assets are based on a percentage of the market value of the assets at the beginning of the quarter. For additional information on certain client investment assets, see the “Earnings Performance – Operating Segment Results – Wealth and Investment Management – WIM Advisory Assets” section in this Report.
Investment banking fees
increased
due to
higher debt underwriting fees.
Mortgage banking
increased due to higher income from net hedge results related to mortgage servicing rights (MSR) valuations.
Net
gains from trading activities
decreased driven by lower revenue in structured products and credit trading, partially offset by higher revenue in commodities and foreign exchange.
Net losses from debt securities
increased driven by higher net losses related to a repositioning of our investment portfolio.
Net gains (losses) from equity securities
decreased driven by
higher unrealized losses from our venture capital investments.
Lease income
decreased driven by a gain associated with the resolution of a legacy lease transaction in first quarter 2024.
O
ther income
increased driven by a $263 million gain on the sale of
the non-agency portion of
our commercial mortgage third-party servicing business.

Noninterest Expense
Table 3:
Noninterest Expense
(1)
Represents expenses for assets we lease to customers.
First quarter 2025 vs. first quarter 2024
Personnel expense
decreased
slightly due to the impact of efficiency initiatives, partially offset by higher revenue-related compensation expense and higher retirement-eligible employee stock compensation expense.
Technology, telecommunications and equipment expense
increased
due to higher expense for the amortization of internally developed software and higher expense for software maintenance and licenses.
Operating losses
decreased driven by
lower expense for customer remediation activities, compared with higher expense in first quarter 2024 related to the further refinement of the remediation costs for historical mortgage lending and other consumer products matters.
For additional information on operating losses, see Note 18 (Revenue and Expenses) to Financial Statements in this Report.
Professional and outside services expense
decreased
driven by lower expense for consulting projects related to our risk and control work, as well as efficiency initiatives to reduce our spending on consultants and contractors.
Other expense
decreased reflecting lower expense for the FDIC special assessment.
For additional information on the FDIC’s special assessment, see Note 18 (Revenue and Expenses) to Financial Statements in this Report.
Income Tax Expense
Table 4:
Income Tax Expense
(1)
Represents (i) Income tax expense (benefit) divided by (ii) Income (loss) before income tax expense (benefit) less Net income (loss) from noncontrolling interests.
The decrease in the effective income tax rate for first quarter 2025, compared with the same period a year ago, was driven by the impact of increased discrete tax benefits related to the resolution of prior period tax matters, as well as the impact of annual vesting of stock-based compensation.
For additional information on income taxes, see
Note 23
(Income Taxes) to Financial Statements in our 2024 Form 10-K.
Operating Segment Results
Our management reporting is organized into four reportable operating segments: Consumer Banking and Lending; Commercial Banking; Corporate and Investment Banking; and Wealth and Investment Management. All other business activities that are not included in the reportable operating segments have been included in Corporate. For additional information, see Table 5 below. We define our reportable operating segments by type of product and customer segment, and their results are based on our management reporting process. The management reporting process measures the performance of the reportable operating segments based on the Company’s management structure, and the results are regularly reviewed with our Chief Executive Officer and relevant senior management. The management reporting process is based on U.S. GAAP and includes specific adjustments, such as funds transfer pricing for asset/liability management, shared revenue and expenses, and taxable-equivalent adjustments to consistently reflect income from taxable and tax-exempt sources, which allows management to assess performance consistently across the operating segments.
Funds Transfer Pricing.
Corporate treasury manages a funds transfer pricing methodology that considers interest rate risk, liquidity risk, and other product characteristics. Operating segments pay a funding charge for their assets and receive a funding credit for their deposits, both of which are included in net interest income. The net impact of the funding charges or credits is recognized in corporate treasury.
Revenue Sharing and Expense Allocations.
When lines of business jointly serve customers, the line of business that is responsible for providing the product or service recognizes revenue or expense with a referral fee paid or an allocation of cost to the other line of business based on established internal revenue-sharing agreements.
When a line of business uses a service provided by another line of business, expense is generally allocated based on the cost and use of the service provided. Enterprise functions, such as operations, technology, and risk management, are included in Corporate with an allocation of their applicable costs to the reportable operating segments based on the level of support provided by the enterprise function. We periodically assess and update our revenue sharing and expense allocation methodologies.
Taxable-Equivalent Adjustments.
Taxable-equivalent adjustments related to tax-exempt income on certain loans and debt securities are included in net interest income, while taxable-equivalent adjustments related to income tax credits for affordable housing and renewable energy investments are included in noninterest income, in each case with corresponding impacts to income tax expense (benefit). Adjustments are included in Corporate, Commercial Banking, and Corporate and Investment Banking and are eliminated to reconcile to the Company’s consolidated financial results.
Allocated Capital.
Reportable operating segments are allocated capital under a risk-sensitive framework that is primarily based on aspects of our regulatory capital requirements, and the assumptions and methodologies used to allocate capital are periodically assessed and updated. Management believes that return on allocated capital is a useful financial measure because it enables management, investors, and others to assess a reportable operating segment’s use of capital.
Selected Metrics.
We present certain financial and nonfinancial metrics that management uses when evaluating reportable operating segment results. Management believes that these metrics are useful to investors and others to assess the performance, customer growth, and trends of reportable operating segments or lines of business.

Adjustments are included in Corporate, Commercial Banking, and Corporate and Investment Banking and are eliminated to reconcile to the Company’s consolidated financial results.
Consumer Banking and Lending
offers diversified financial products and services for consumers and small businesses with annual sales generally up to $10 million. These financial products and services include checking and savings accounts, credit and debit cards, as well as home, auto, personal, and small business lending. In April 2025, we completed the acquisition of the remaining interest in our merchant processing services joint
venture, Wells Fargo Merchant Services. As a result of the acquisition, we expect increased expense related to the amortization of an intangible asset associated with the acquired merchant contracts.

WIM Advisory Assets.
In addition to transactional accounts, WIM offers advisory account relationships to brokerage customers. Fees from advisory accounts are based on a percentage of the market value of the assets as of the beginning of the quarter, which vary across the account types based on the distinct services provided, and are affected by investment performance as well as asset inflows and outflows. Advisory accounts include assets that are financial advisor-directed and separately managed by third-party managers as well as certain client-directed brokerage assets where we earn a fee for advisory and other services, but do not have investment discretion.
WIM also manages personal trust and other assets for high net worth clients, with fee income earned based on a percentage of the market value of these assets.
Table 6h presents advisory assets activity by WIM line of business. Management believes that advisory assets is a useful metric because it allows management, investors, and others to assess how changes in asset amounts may impact the generation of certain asset-based fees. For the first quarter of both 2025 and 2024, the average fee rate by account type ranged from 50 to 120 basis points.

Represents amortized cost of the securities, net of the allowance for credit losses, of $34 million related to available-for-sale debt securities at both March 31, 2025, and December 31, 2024, and $104 million and $95 million related to held-to-maturity debt securities at March 31, 2025, and December 31, 2024, respectively.
(2)
Available-for-sale debt securities are carried on our consolidated balance sheet at fair value.
(3)
Held-to-maturity debt securities are carried on our consolidated balance sheet at amortized cost, net of the allowance for credit losses.
Table 7 presents a summary of our portfolio of investments in available-for-sale (AFS) and held-to-maturity (HTM) debt securities. See Note 3 (Available-for-Sale and Held-to-Maturity Debt Securities) to Financial Statements in this Report for additional information on AFS and HTM debt securities, including a summary of debt securities by security type, contractual maturities and weighted average yields. See also the “Balance Sheet Analysis – Available-for-Sale and Held-to-Maturity Debt Securities” section in our 2024 Form 10-K for additional information on our investment management objectives and practices and the “Risk Management – Asset/Liability Management” section in this Report for information on liquidity and interest rate risk.
The amortized cost, net of the allowance for credit losses, of the total AFS and HTM debt securities portfolio increased from December 31, 2024. Purchases of AFS debt securities were partially offset by paydowns and maturities of AFS and HTM debt securities, as well as sales of AFS debt securities
.
The total net unrealized losses on AFS and HTM debt securities decreased from December 31, 2024, due to changes in interest rates and the realization of losses related to a
repositioning of our AFS debt securities portfolio
.
At March 31, 2025, 99% of the combined AFS and HTM debt securities portfolio was rated AA- or above. Ratings are based on external ratings where available and, where not available, based on internal credit grades.
Loan Portfolios
Table 8 provides a summary of total outstanding loans by portfolio segment. Commercial loans increased from December 31, 2024, driven by an increase in commercial and industrial loans as a result of increased originations and loan
draws, partially offset by paydowns. Consumer loans decreased from December 31, 2024, driven by decreases in the residential mortgage, credit card, and auto loan portfolios, as loan paydowns exceeded originations.

Loan Portfolios
Average loan balances and a comparative detail of average loan balances is included in Table 1 under “Earnings Performance – Net Interest Income” earlier in this Report. Additional information on total loans outstanding by portfolio segment and class of financing receivable is included in the “Risk Management – Credit Risk Management” section in this Report. Period-end balances and other loan related information are in Note 5 (Loans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses) to Financial Statements in this Report.
See the “Balance Sheet Analysis – Loan Portfolios” section in our 2024 Form 10-K for additional information regarding contractual loan maturities and the distribution of loans to changes in interest rates.
Deposits
Deposits decreased from December 31, 2024, driven by lower time deposits due to maturities of CDs issued by corporate treasury.
Table 9 provides additional information regarding deposit balances. Information regarding the impact of deposits on net interest income and a comparison of average deposit balances is provided in the “Earnings Performance – Net Interest Income” section and Table 1 earlier in this Report. Our average deposit cost in first quarter 2025 decreased to 1.58%, compared with 1.73% in fourth quarter 2024.
Table 9:
Deposits
In the ordinary course of business, we engage in financial transactions that are not recorded on our consolidated balance sheet or may be recorded on our consolidated balance sheet in amounts that are different from the full contract or notional amount of the transaction. Our off-balance sheet arrangements include unfunded credit commitments, transactions with unconsolidated entities, guarantees, derivatives, and other commitments. These transactions are designed to (1) meet the financial needs of customers, (2) manage our credit, market or liquidity risks, and/or (3) diversify our funding sources.
Unfunded Credit Commitments
Unfunded credit commitments are legally binding agreements to lend to customers with terms covering usage of funds, contractual interest rates, expiration dates, and any required collateral. The maximum credit risk for these commitments will generally be lower than the contractual amount because these commitments may expire without being used or may be cancelled at the customer’s request. Our credit risk monitoring activities include managing the amount of commitments, both to individual customers and in total, and the size and maturity structure of these commitments. For additional information, see Note 5 (Loans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses) to Financial Statements in this Report.
Transactions with Unconsolidated Entities
In the normal course of business, we enter into various types of on- and off-balance sheet transactions with special purpose entities (SPEs), which are corporations, trusts, limited liability companies or partnerships that are established for a limited purpose. Generally, SPEs are formed in connection with securitization transactions and are considered variable interest entities (VIEs). For additional information, see Note 13 (Securitizations and Variable Interest Entities) to Financial Statements in this Report.
Guarantees and Other Commitments
Guarantees are contracts that contingently require us to make payments to a guaranteed party based on an event or a change in an underlying asset, liability, rate or index. Guarantees are generally in the form of standby and direct pay letters of credit, written options, recourse obligations, exchange and clearing house guarantees, indemnifications, and other types of similar arrangements. We also enter into other commitments such as commitments to purchase securities under resale agreements. For additional information, see Note 14 (Guarantees and Other Commitments) to Financial Statements in this Report.
Derivatives
We use derivatives to manage exposure to market risk, including interest rate risk, credit risk and foreign currency risk, and to assist customers with their risk management objectives. Derivatives are recorded on our consolidated balance sheet at fair value, and volume can be measured in terms of the notional amount, which is generally not exchanged, but is used only as the basis on which interest and other payments are determined. The notional amount is not recorded on our consolidated balance sheet and is not, when viewed in isolation, a meaningful measure of the risk profile of the instruments. For additional information, see Note 11 (Derivatives) to Financial Statements in this Report.
Wells Fargo manages a variety of risks that can significantly affect our financial performance and our ability to meet the expectations of our customers, shareholders, regulators and other stakeholders.
For additional information about how we manage risk, see the “Risk Management” section in our 2024 Form 10-K. The discussion that follows supplements our discussion of the management of certain risks contained in the “Risk Management” section in our 2024 Form 10-K.
Credit Risk Management
Credit risk is the risk of loss associated with a borrower or counterparty default (failure to meet obligations in accordance with agreed upon terms). Credit risk exists with many of the Company’s assets and exposures such as debt security holdings, certain derivatives, and loans.
The Board’s Risk Committee has primary oversight responsibility for credit risk. At the management level, Corporate Credit Risk, which is part of Independent Risk Management, has oversight responsibility for credit risk. Corporate Credit Risk reports to the Chief Risk Officer and supports periodic reports related to credit risk provided to the Board’s Risk Committee.
Loan Portfolio
.
Our loan portfolios represent the largest component of assets on our consolidated balance sheet for which we have credit risk. Table 10 presents our total loans outstanding by portfolio segment and class of financing receivable.
Table 10:
Total Loans Outstanding by Portfolio Segment and Class of Financing Receivable
We manage our credit risk by establishing what we believe are sound credit policies for underwriting new business, while monitoring and reviewing the performance of our existing loan portfolios. We employ various credit risk management and monitoring activities to mitigate risks associated with multiple risk factors affecting loans we hold including:
•
Loan concentrations and related credit quality;
•
Counterparty credit risk;
•
Economic and market conditions;
•
Legislative or regulatory mandates;
•
Changes in interest rates;
•
Merger and acquisition activities; and
•
Reputation risk.
Our credit risk management oversight process is governed centrally, but provides for direct management and accountability by our lines of business. Our overall credit process includes comprehensive credit policies, disciplined credit underwriting, frequent and detailed risk measurement and modeling, extensive credit training programs, and a continual loan review and audit process.
A key to our credit risk management is adherence to a well-controlled underwriting process, which we believe is appropriate for the needs of our customers as well as investors who purchase the loans or securities collateralized by the loans.

Significant Loan Portfolio Reviews
.
Our credit risk monitoring process is designed to enable early identification of developing risk and to support our determination of an appropriate allowance for credit losses. The following discussion provides additional characteristics and analysis of our significant portfolios. See Note 5 (Loans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses) to Financial Statements in this Report for more analysis and credit metric information for each of the following portfolios.
COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL LOANS AND LEASE FINANCING.
For purposes of portfolio risk management, we aggregate commercial and industrial loans and lease financing according to market segmentation and standard industry codes. We generally subject commercial and industrial loans and lease financing to individual risk assessment using our internal borrower and collateral quality ratings. Our ratings are aligned to regulatory definitions of pass and criticized categories with criticized segmented among special mention, substandard, doubtful, and loss categories.
Risk Management – Credit Risk Management
(continued)
Generally, the primary source of repayment for our commercial and industrial loans and lease financing portfolio is the operating cash flows of customers, with the collateral securing this portfolio representing a secondary source of repayment. The majority of this portfolio is secured by short-term assets, such as accounts receivable, inventory, and debt securities, as well as long-lived assets, such as equipment and other business assets.
We had $16.0 billion of the commercial and industrial loans and lease financing portfolio classified as criticized in accordance with
regulatory guidance at March 31, 2025, compared with $16.5 billion at December 31, 2024.
The portfolio increased at March 31, 2025, compared with December 31, 2024, as a result of increased originations and loan draws, partially offset by paydowns. Table 12 provides our commercial and industrial loans and lease financing by industry. The industry categories are based on the North American Industry Classification System.

Total commitments consist of loans outstanding plus unfunded credit commitments, excluding issued letters of credit and discretionary amounts where our approval or consent is required prior to any loan funding or commitment increase. For additional information on issued letters of credit, see Note 14 (Guarantees and Other Commitments) to Financial Statements in this Report.
(2)
No other single industry had total loans in excess of $5.9 billion and $3.2 billion at March 31, 2025, and December 31, 2024, respectively.
Table 12a provides further loan segmentation for our largest industry category, financials except banks. This category includes loans to investment firms, financial vehicles, nonbank creditors, rental and leasing companies, securities firms, and investment banks. These loans are generally secured and have features to
help manage credit risk, such as structural credit enhancements, collateral eligibility requirements, contractual re-margining of collateral supporting the loans, and loan amounts limited to a percentage of the value of the underlying assets considering underlying credit risk, asset duration, and ongoing performance.

Includes asset-based lending and leasing, including loans to special purpose entities, loans to commercial leasing entities, structured lending facilities to commercial loan managers, and also includes collateralized loan obligations (CLOs) in loan form, all of which were rated AA or above, of $3.0 billion and $3.7 billion at March 31, 2025, and December 31, 2024, respectively.
(4)
Includes originators or servicers of financial assets collateralized by consumer loans such as auto loans and leases, and credit cards.
(5)
Includes originators or servicers of financial assets collateralized by commercial or residential real estate loans.
Our commercial and industrial loans and lease financing portfolio included non-U.S. loans of $64.7 billion and $62.6 billion at March 31, 2025, and December 31, 2024, respectively. Significant industry concentrations of non-U.S. loans at March 31, 2025, and December 31, 2024, respectively, included:
•
$39.9 billion and $36.3 billion in the financials except banks industry;
•
$5.7 billion and $7.4 billion in the banks industry; and
•
$2.3 billion and $2.3 billion
in the oil, gas and pipelines industry.
COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE (CRE).
Our CRE loan portfolio is composed of CRE mortgage and CRE construction loans. The total CRE loan portfolio decreased $2.5 billion from December 31, 2024, as paydowns exceeded originations and advances. The portfolio is diversified both geographically and by property type. The largest geographic concentrations of CRE loans are in California, New York, Florida, and Texas, which represented a combined 48% of the total CRE portfolio. The largest property type concentrations are apartments at 29% and office at 20% of the portfolio. Unfunded credit commitments at both March 31, 2025, and December 31, 2024, were $5.4 billion for CRE mortgage loans and $6.2 billion and $7.1 billion, respectively, for CRE construction loans.
We generally subject CRE loans to individual risk assessment using our internal borrower and collateral quality ratings.
We had $17.0 billion of CRE mortgage loans classified as criticized in accordance with regulatory guidance at March 31, 2025, compared with $17.8 billion at December 31, 2024. We had $1.6 billion of CRE construction loans classified as criticized in accordance with regulatory guidance at March 31, 2025, compared with $1.5 billion at December 31, 2024. The decrease in criticized CRE mortgage loans was predominantly driven by the office and apartment property types.
We continue to closely monitor the credit quality of the office property type given weakened demand for office space. Loans in California and New York represented approximately 40% of the office property type at both March 31, 2025, and December 31, 2024.
Table 13 provides our CRE loans by state and property type.

Risk Management – Credit Risk Management
(continued)
NON-U.S. LOANS.
Our classification of non-U.S. loans is based on whether the borrower’s primary address is outside of the United States. At March 31, 2025, non-U.S. loans totaled $69.8 billion, representing approximately 8% of our total consolidated loans outstanding, compared with $67.9 billion, or approximately 7% of our total consolidated loans outstanding, at December 31, 2024. Non-U.S. loans were approximately 4% of our total consolidated assets at both March 31, 2025, and December 31, 2024.
COUNTRY RISK EXPOSURE.
Our country risk monitoring process incorporates centralized monitoring of economic, political, social, legal, and transfer risks in countries where we do or plan to do business, along with frequent dialogue with our customers, counterparties and regulatory agencies. We establish exposure limits for each country through a centralized oversight process based on customer needs, and through consideration of the relevant and distinct risk of each country. We monitor exposures closely and adjust our country limits in response to changing conditions. We evaluate our individual country risk exposure based on our assessment of a borrower’s ability to repay,
which gives consideration for allowable transfers of risk, such as guarantees and collateral, and may be different from the reporting based on a borrower’s primary address.
Our largest single country exposure outside the U.S. at March 31, 2025, was the United Kingdom, which totaled $31.3 billion, or approximately 2% of our total assets, of which $5.6 billion were sovereign exposures and included deposits we have placed with the Bank of England pursuant to regulatory requirements in support of our London branch.
Table 14 provides information regarding our top 20 exposures by country (excluding the U.S.), based on our assessment of risk, which gives consideration to the country of any guarantors and/or underlying collateral. With respect to Table 14:
•
Lending exposure consists of loans outstanding plus unfunded credit commitments (excluding discretionary amounts where our approval or consent is required prior to any loan funding or commitment increase) and is presented prior to the deduction of the allowance for credit losses or collateral received under the terms of the credit agreements, if any.
•
Securities exposure represents debt and equity securities of non-U.S. issuers. If applicable, long and short positions are netted.
•
Derivatives and other exposure represents foreign exchange contracts, derivative contracts, securities resale agreements, and securities lending agreements.

The 2024 exposures correspond to the ranking of the top 20 country exposures at March 31, 2025, and do not necessarily reflect our top 20 country exposures at December 31, 2024.
RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE LOANS.
Our residential mortgage loan portfolio is composed of 1–4 family first and junior lien mortgage loans. Junior lien mortgage loans consist of residential mortgage lines of credit and loans that are subordinate in rights to an existing lien on the same property. Residential mortgage – first lien loans represented 96% of the total residential mortgage loan portfolio at both March 31, 2025, and December 31, 2024.
The residential mortgage loan portfolio includes loans with adjustable-rate features. We monitor the risk of default as a result of interest rate increases on adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) loans, which may be mitigated by product features that limit the amount of the increase in the contractual interest rate. The default risk of these loans is considered in our ACL for loans. ARM loans were $66.6 billion, or 7% of total loans, at March 31, 2025, compared with $66.3 billion, or 7% of total loans, at December 31, 2024, with an initial reset date in 2027 or later for the majority of this portfolio at March 31, 2025. We do not offer option ARM products, nor do we offer variable-rate mortgage products with fixed payment amounts, commonly referred to within the financial services industry as negative amortizing mortgage loans.
The outstanding balance of residential mortgage lines of credit (both first and junior lien) was $11.8 billion at March 31, 2025, compared with $12.4 billion at December 31, 2024. The unfunded credit commitments for these lines of credit totaled $21.0 billion at March 31, 2025, compared with $22.5 billion at December 31, 2024. For additional information on our residential
mortgage loan portfolio, see the “Risk Management – Credit Risk Management – Residential Mortgage Loans” section in our 2024 Form 10-K.
We monitor changes in real estate values and underlying economic or market conditions for the geographic areas of our
residential mortgage loan portfolio as part of our credit risk management process. Our periodic review of this portfolio includes original appraisals adjusted for the change in Home Price Index (HPI) or estimates from automated valuation models (AVMs) to support property values. For additional information about our use of appraisals and AVMs, see Note 5 (Loans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses) to Financial Statements in this Report and the “Risk Management – Credit Risk Management – Residential Mortgage Loans” section in our 2024 Form 10-K.
Part of our credit monitoring includes tracking delinquency, current Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) credit scores and loan to collateral values (LTV) on the entire residential mortgage loan portfolio. For junior lien mortgages, LTV uses the total combined loan balance of first and junior lien mortgages (including unused line of credit amounts). For additional information regarding credit quality indicators, see Note 5 (Loans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses) to Financial Statements in this Report.
We continue to modify residential mortgage loans to assist homeowners and other borrowers experiencing financial difficulties. For additional information on loan modifications, see Note 5 (Loans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses) to Financial Statements in this Report and the “Risk Management – Credit Risk Management – Residential Mortgage Loans” section in our 2024 Form 10-K.
Our residential mortgage loan portfolio decreased $2.7 billion from December 31, 2024, due to loan paydowns, partially offset by originations. Table 15 shows the outstanding balances of our first and junior lien mortgage loan portfolios.
Table 15:

Includes $21.7 billion and $21.4 billion at March 31, 2025, and December 31, 2024, respectively, of securities-based loans originated by the WIM operating segment.
Credit Card.
The decrease in the outstanding balance at March 31, 2025, compared with December 31, 2024, was driven by seasonal paydowns.
Auto.
The decrease in the outstanding balance at March 31, 2025, compared with December 31, 2024, was due to paydowns exceeding originations reflecting our actions related to credit tightening.
Other Consumer.
The outstanding balance at March 31, 2025, was stable compared with December 31, 2024.
NONPERFORMING ASSETS (NONACCRUAL LOANS AND FORECLOSED ASSETS).
For information about when we generally place loans on nonaccrual status, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to Financial Statements in our 2024 Form 10-K. Table 17 summarizes nonperforming assets.
Table 17:
Nonperforming Assets (Nonaccrual Loans and Foreclosed Assets)
(1)
Residential mortgage loans are not placed on nonaccrual status when they are insured or guaranteed by U.S. government agencies, such as the FHA or the VA.
(2)
Consistent with regulatory reporting requirements, foreclosed real estate resulting from government insured/guaranteed loans are classified as nonperforming. Both principal and interest related to these foreclosed real estate assets are collectible because the loans were insured or guaranteed by U.S. government agencies. Receivables related to the foreclosure of certain government guaranteed real estate mortgage loans are excluded from this table and included in accounts receivable in other assets. For additional information on the classification of certain government-guaranteed mortgage loans upon foreclosure, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to Financial Statements in our 2024 Form 10-K.
Total nonaccrual loans increased $248 million from December 31, 2024, driven by higher commercial and industrial nonaccrual loans.
For additional information on commercial nonaccrual loans, see the “Risk Management – Credit Risk Management – Commercial and Industrial Loans and Lease Financing” and “Risk Management – Credit Risk Management – Commercial Real Estate” sections in this Report.
Table 18 provides an analysis of the changes in nonaccrual loans. Typically, changes to nonaccrual loans period-over-period represent inflows for loans that are placed on nonaccrual status in accordance with our policies, offset by reductions for loans
that are paid down, charged off, sold, foreclosed, or are no longer classified as nonaccrual as a result of continued performance and an improvement in the borrower’s financial condition and loan repayment capabilities.
Table 18:
Analysis of Changes in Nonaccrual Loans
We considered the risk of losses on nonaccrual loans in developing our allowance for loan losses. We believe exposure to losses on nonaccrual loans is mitigated by the following factors at March 31, 2025:
•
97% of total commercial nonaccrual loans were secured, predominantly by real estate.
•
61% of total commercial nonaccrual loans were current on interest and 49% of commercial nonaccrual loans were current on both principal and interest, but were on nonaccrual status because the full or timely collection of interest or principal had become uncertain.
•
99% of total consumer nonaccrual loans were secured, of which 96% were secured by real estate and 98% had an LTV ratio of 80% or less.
•
$431 million of the $533 million of consumer loans in bankruptcy or discharged in bankruptcy, and classified as nonaccrual, were current.

NET CHARGE-OFFS.
Table 19 presents net loan charge-offs.
Table 19:
Net Loan Charge-offs
(1)
Net loan charge-offs (recoveries) as a percentage of average loans are annualized.
The decrease in commercial net loan charge-offs in first quarter 2025, compared with the same period a year ago, was due to lower losses in our commercial real estate portfolio driven by the office property type and lower losses in our commercial and industrial portfolio.
The decrease in consumer net loan charge-offs in first quarter 2025, compared with the same period a year ago, was due to lower losses in our auto and other consumer portfolios, partially offset by higher losses in our credit card portfolio.
ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES.
We maintain an allowance for credit losses (ACL) for loans, which is management’s estimate of the expected lifetime credit losses in the loan portfolio and unfunded credit commitments, at the balance sheet date, excluding loans and unfunded credit commitments carried at fair value or held for sale. Additionally, we maintain an ACL for debt securities classified as either AFS or HTM, other financial assets measured at amortized cost, including deposits with banks, net investments in leases, and other off-balance sheet credit exposures.
The process for establishing the ACL for loans takes into consideration many factors, including historical and forecasted loss trends, loan-level credit quality ratings and loan grade-specific characteristics. The process involves subjective and
complex judgments. In addition, we review a variety of credit metrics and trends. These credit metrics and trends, however, do not solely determine the amount of the allowance as we use several analytical tools. For additional information on our ACL, see the “Critical Accounting Policies – Allowance for Credit Losses” section and Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to Financial Statements in our 2024 Form 10-K. For additional information on our ACL for loans, see Note 5 (Loans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses) to Financial Statements in this Report, and for additional information on our ACL for debt securities, see Note 3 (Available-for-Sale and Held-to-Maturity Debt Securities) to Financial Statements in this Report.
Table 20 presents the allocation of the ACL for loans by loan portfolio segment and class.
Table 20:
Allocation of the ACL for Loans
(1)
Includes negative allowance for expected recoveries of amounts previously charged off.
(2)
Total net loan charge-offs are annualized for the quarter ended March 31, 2025.
The ratios for the allowance for loan losses and the ACL for loans presented in Table 20 may fluctuate from period to period due to such factors as the mix of loan types in the portfolio, borrower credit strength, and the value and marketability of collateral.
The ACL for loans decreased $84 million, or 1%, from December 31, 2024, reflecting a lower allowance for commercial real estate loans on lower loan balances, partially offset by a higher allowance for commercial and industrial loans. The detail of the changes in the ACL for loans by portfolio segment (including charge-offs and recoveries by loan class) is included in Note 5 (Loans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses) to Financial Statements in this Report.
Risk Management – Credit Risk Management
(continued)
We consider multiple economic scenarios to develop our estimate of the ACL for loans, which generally include a base scenario, along with an optimistic (upside) and one or more pessimistic (downside) scenarios. We weighted the base scenario and the downside scenarios in our estimate of the ACL for loans at March 31, 2025. The base scenario assumed slowing inflation along with slowing economic growth, a decline in commercial real estate prices, and stable to improving unemployment rates. The downside scenarios assumed a more substantial economic contraction due to lower business and consumer confidence, declining property values, and uncertainty related to trade policies.
Additionally, we consider qualitative factors that represent management’s judgment of risks related to our processes and assumptions used in establishing the ACL such as economic environmental factors, modeling assumptions and performance, process risk, and other subjective factors, including industry trends and emerging risk assessments, such as recent macroeconomic uncertainty related to trade policies.
The forecasted key economic variables used in our estimate of the ACL for loans at March 31, 2025, and December 31, 2024, are presented in Table 21.
Table 21:
Forecasted
Key
Economic Variables
(1)
Quarterly average.
(2)
Percent change from the preceding period, seasonally adjusted annualized rate.
(3)
Percent change year over year of national average; outlook differs by geography and property type.
Future amounts of the ACL for loans will be based on a variety of factors, including loan balance changes, portfolio credit quality and mix changes, and changes in general economic conditions and expectations (including for unemployment and real GDP), among other factors.
We believe the ACL for loans of $14.6 billion at March 31, 2025, was appropriate to cover expected credit losses, including unfunded credit commitments, at that date. The entire allowance is available to absorb credit losses from the total loan portfolio. The ACL for loans is subject to change and reflects existing factors as of the date of determination, including economic or market conditions and ongoing internal and external examination processes. Due to the sensitivity of the ACL for loans to changes in the economic and business environment, it is possible that we will incur incremental credit losses not anticipated as of the balance sheet date. Our process for determining the ACL is discussed in the “Critical Accounting Policies – Allowance for
Credit Losses” section and Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to Financial Statements in our 2024 Form 10-K.
MORTGAGE BANKING ACTIVITIES.
We sell residential and commercial mortgage loans to various parties. In connection with our sales and securitization of residential mortgage loans, we have established a mortgage repurchase liability. For information on our repurchase liability, see the “Risk Management – Credit Risk Management – Mortgage Banking Activities” section in our 2024 Form 10-K.
In addition to servicing loans in our portfolio, we act as servicer of residential and commercial mortgage loans included in government-sponsored enterprise (GSE) mortgage securitizations, GNMA-guaranteed mortgage securitizations of FHA-insured/VA-guaranteed mortgages and private label mortgage securitizations, as well as for unsecuritized loans owned by institutional investors.
As a servicer, we are required to advance certain delinquent payments of principal and interest on mortgage loans we service. The amount and timing of reimbursement for advances of delinquent payments vary by investor and the applicable servicing agreements. See Note 6 (Mortgage Banking Activities) to Financial Statements in this Report for additional information about residential and commercial servicing rights, servicer advances and servicing fees.
In accordance with applicable servicing guidelines, upon transfer as servicer, we have the option to repurchase loans from certain loan securitizations, which generally becomes exercisable based on delinquency status such as when three scheduled loan payments are past due. When we have the unilateral option to repurchase a loan, we recognize the loan and a corresponding liability on our balance sheet regardless of our intent to repurchase the loan. We may repurchase these loans for cash and as a result, our total consolidated assets do not change.
Loans repurchased from GNMA securitization pools that regain current status or are otherwise modified in accordance with applicable servicing guidelines may be included in future GNMA loan securitization pools. At March 31, 2025, and December 31, 2024, these loans, which we have repurchased or have the unilateral option to repurchase, were $7.4 billion and $7.5 billion, respectively, which included $6.9 billion and $7.1 billion, respectively, in loans held for investment, with the remainder in loans held for sale. See Note 13 (Securitizations and Variable Interest Entities) to Financial Statements in this Report for additional information about our involvement with mortgage loan securitizations.
For additional information about the risks related to our servicing activities, see the “Risk Management – Credit Risk Management – Mortgage Banking Activities” section in our 2024 Form 10-K.

Asset/liability management involves measuring, monitoring and managing interest rate risk, market risk, liquidity and funding. For additional information on our oversight of asset/liability risks, see the “Risk Management – Asset/Liability Management” section in our 2024 Form 10-K.
INTEREST RATE RISK.
Interest rate risk is the risk that market fluctuations in interest rates, credit spreads, or foreign exchange can cause a loss of the Company’s earnings and capital stemming from mismatches in the cash flows of the Company’s assets and liabilities.
We are subject to interest rate risk because:
•
assets and liabilities may mature or reprice at different times or by different amounts;
•
short-term and long-term market interest rates may change independently or with different magnitudes;
•
the remaining maturity for various assets or liabilities may shorten or lengthen as interest rates change; or
•
interest rates may also have a direct or indirect effect on loan demand, collateral values, credit losses, loan origination volume, and the fair value of financial instruments and MSRs.
We measure interest rate risk exposure from customer-related lending and deposit-taking activities, as well as from investments in AFS and HTM debt securities and from issuances of long-term debt. Interest rate risk is measured by comparing the earnings outcomes from multiple interest rate scenarios relative to our base scenario. The base scenario is a reference point used by the Company for financial planning purposes. These scenarios may differ in the direction of interest rate changes, the degree and speed of interest rate changes over time, and the projected shape of the yield curve. They also require assumptions regarding drivers of earnings and balance sheet composition such as loan originations, prepayment rates on loans and debt securities, deposit flows and mix, as well as pricing strategies. We periodically assess and enhance our scenarios and assumptions.
Table 22 presents the results of the estimated net interest income sensitivity over the next 12 months from the multiple scenarios compared with our base scenario. These hypothetical scenarios include instantaneous movements across the yield curve with both lower and higher interest rates under a parallel shift, as well as steeper and flatter non-parallel changes in the yield curve. Long-term interest rates are defined as all tenors three years and longer, and short-term interest rates are defined as all tenors less than three years. CIB Markets trading net interest income is excluded from the sensitivity analysis since CIB Markets trading net interest income may be offset by trading-related noninterest income. For additional information on the market risk of financial instruments used in our trading activities, which are measured at fair value through earnings, see the “Risk Management – Asset/Liability Management – Market Risk – Trading Activities” section in this Report.
Our scenario assumptions reflected the following:
•
Scenarios are dynamic and reflect anticipated changes to our assets and liabilities over time.
•
Mortgage prepayment and origination assumptions vary across scenarios and reflect only the impact of the higher or lower interest rates.
•
Other macroeconomic variables that could be correlated with the changes in interest rates are held constant.
•
The funding forecast in our base scenario incorporates deposit mix changes and market funding levels consistent with the base interest rate trajectory. Our hypothetical scenarios incorporate deposit mix that is the same as in the base scenario. In higher interest rate scenarios, potential customer deposit activity that shifts balances into higher yielding products and/or requires additional market funding could reduce the expected benefit from higher rates. Conversely, in lower interest rate scenarios, a potential shift to a funding mix with lower yielding deposits and/or less market funding could reduce the impact of lower rates on earning assets in these scenarios.
•
The interest rate sensitivity of deposits as market interest rates change, referred to as deposit betas, are informed by historical behavior and expectations for near-term pricing strategies. Our actual experience may differ from expectations due to the lag or acceleration of deposit repricing, changes in consumer behavior, and other factors.
Table 22:
Net Interest Income Sensitivity Over the Next 12 Months Using Instantaneous Movements
(1)
In first quarter 2025, we made an update to exclude the net interest income sensitivity for trading-related assets and liabilities of our CIB Markets trading business. Prior period amounts have been revised to conform with the current period presentation.
The changes in our interest rate sensitivity from December 31, 2024, to March 31, 2025, reflected updates for our expected balance sheet composition. Our interest rate sensitivity indicates that we would expect to benefit from higher interest rates as our assets would reprice faster and to a greater degree than our liabilities, while in the case of lower interest rates, our assets would reprice downward and to a greater degree than our liabilities resulting in lower net interest income. The realized impact of interest rate changes may vary from our base and hypothetical scenarios for various reasons, including any deposit pricing lags.
We use interest rate derivatives and our debt securities portfolio to manage our interest rate exposures. We use derivatives for asset/liability management to (i) convert cash flows from selected assets and/or liabilities from floating-rate payments to fixed-rate payments, or vice versa, (ii) reduce accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) sensitivity of our AFS debt securities portfolio, and/or (iii) economically hedge our mortgage origination pipeline, funded mortgage loans, and MSRs. Derivatives used to hedge our interest rate risk exposures are presented in Note 11 (Derivatives) to Financial Statements in this Report. As interest rates increase, changes in the fair value of AFS debt securities may negatively affect AOCI, which lowers the amount of our regulatory capital. AOCI also includes unrealized gains or losses related to the transfer of debt securities from AFS
Risk Management – Asset/Liability Management
(continued)
to HTM, which are subsequently amortized into earnings over the life of the security with no further impact from interest rate changes. See Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) and Note 3 (Available-for-Sale and Held-to-Maturity Debt Securities) to Financial Statements in this Report for additional information on our debt securities portfolio.
In addition to the net interest income sensitivity above, we also measure and evaluate the economic value sensitivity (EVS) of our balance sheet. EVS is the change in the present value of the life-time cash flows of the Company’s assets and liabilities across a range of scenarios. It is based on the existing balance sheet, at a point in time, and helps indicate whether we are exposed to higher or lower interest rates. We manage EVS through a set of limits that are designed to align with our interest rate risk appetite.
Interest rate sensitive noninterest income is impacted by changes in earnings credit for noninterest-bearing deposits that reduce treasury management deposit-related service fees on commercial accounts. Our interest rate sensitive noninterest income is also impacted by mortgage banking activities that may have sensitivity impacts that move in the opposite direction of our net interest income. See the “Risk Management – Asset/Liability Management – Mortgage Banking Interest Rate and Market Risk” section in our 2024 Form 10-K for additional information.
MORTGAGE BANKING INTEREST RATE AND MARKET RISK.
We originate and service mortgage loans, which subjects us to various risks, including market, interest rate, credit, and liquidity risks that can be substantial. Based on market conditions and other factors, we reduce credit and liquidity risks by selling or securitizing mortgage loans. We determine whether mortgage loans will be held for investment or held for sale at the time of commitment, but may change our intent to hold loans for investment or sale as part of our corporate asset/liability management activities. We may also retain securities in our investment portfolio at the time we securitize mortgage loans.
Changes in interest rates may impact mortgage banking noninterest income, including origination and servicing fees, and the fair value of our residential MSRs, LHFS, and derivative loan commitments (interest rate “locks”) extended to mortgage applicants. Interest rate changes will generally impact our mortgage banking noninterest income on a lagging basis due to the time it takes for the market to reflect a shift in customer demand, as well as the time required for processing a new application, providing the commitment, and securitizing and selling the loan. The amount and timing of the impact will depend on the magnitude, speed and duration of the changes in interest rates. For additional information on mortgage banking, including key assumptions and the sensitivity of the fair value of MSRs, see the “Risk Management – Asset/Liability Management – Mortgage Banking Interest Rate and Market Risk” section in our 2024 Form 10-K and Note 6 (Mortgage Banking Activities) and Note 12 (Fair Value Measurements) to Financial Statements in this Report.
MARKET RISK.
Market risk is the risk of possible economic loss from adverse changes in market risk factors such as interest rates, credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, equity and commodity prices, and the risk of possible loss due to counterparty exposure. This applies to implied volatility risk, basis risk, and market liquidity risk. It includes price risk in the trading book, mortgage servicing rights, the hedge effectiveness risk associated with the mortgage book held at fair value, and impairment on private equity investments. For additional information on our oversight of market risk, see the “Risk Management – Asset/Liability Management – Market Risk” section in our 2024 Form 10-K.
MARKET RISK – TRADING ACTIVITIES.
We engage in trading activities to accommodate the investment and risk management activities of our customers and to execute economic hedging to manage certain balance sheet risks. These trading activities predominantly occur within our CIB Markets business. Debt and equity securities held for trading, trading loans, and trading derivatives are financial instruments used in our trading activities, and are measured at fair value through earnings. Income earned on the financial instruments used in our trading activities include net interest income, changes in fair value, and realized gains and losses. Net interest income earned from our trading activities is reflected in the interest income and interest expense components of our consolidated statement of income. Changes in fair value and realized gains and losses of the financial instruments used in our trading activities are reflected in net gains from trading activities. For additional information on the financial instruments used in our trading activities and the income from these trading activities, see Note 2 (Trading Activities) to Financial Statements in this Report.
Value-at-risk (VaR) is a statistical risk measure used to estimate the potential loss from adverse moves in the financial markets, and Trading VaR is a measure used to provide insight into the market risk exhibited by the Company’s trading positions on our consolidated balance sheet. The Company uses these VaR metrics complemented with sensitivity analysis and stress testing in measuring and monitoring market risk. The Company calculates Trading VaR for risk management purposes to establish and monitor line of business and Company-wide risk limits. Trading VaR is calculated based on all trading positions on our consolidated balance sheet. Table 23 shows the Company’s Trading General VaR by risk category. For additional information on our monitoring activities, sensitivity analysis, stress testing, Trading VaR, and Trading General VaR by risk category, see the “Risk Management – Asset/Liability Management – Market Risk – Trading Activities” section in our 2024 Form 10-K.
Table 23:
Trading 1-Day 99% General VaR by Risk Category
The diversification effect arises because the risks are not perfectly correlated causing a portfolio of positions to usually be less risky than the sum of the risks of the positions alone. The diversification benefit is not meaningful for low and high metrics since they may occur on different days.
MARKET RISK – EQUITY SECURITIES.
We are directly and indirectly affected by changes in the equity markets. We make and manage equity investments in various businesses, such as start-up companies and emerging growth companies, some of which are made by our venture capital business. We also invest in funds that make similar private equity investments. For additional information, see the “Risk Management – Asset/Liability Management – Market Risk – Equity Securities” section in our 2024 Form 10-K.
Additionally, as part of our business to support our customers, we trade public equities, listed/over-the-counter equity derivatives, and convertible bonds. We have parameters that govern these activities. For additional information on our equity securities, see Note 4 (Equity Securities) to Financial Statements in this Report.
Changes in equity market prices may also indirectly affect our net income by (1) the value of third-party assets under management and, hence, fee income, (2) borrowers whose ability to repay principal and/or interest may be affected by the stock market, or (3) brokerage activity, related commission income and other business activities. Each business line monitors and manages these indirect risks.
LIQUIDITY RISK AND FUNDING.
Liquidity risk is the risk arising from the inability of the Company to meet obligations when they come due, or roll over funds at a reasonable cost, without incurring heightened costs. In the ordinary course of business, we enter into contractual obligations that may require future cash payments, including funding for customer loan requests, customer deposit maturities and withdrawals, debt service, leases for premises and equipment, and other cash commitments. Liquidity risk also considers the stability of deposits, including the risk of losing uninsured or non-operational deposits. The objective of effective liquidity management is to be able to meet our contractual obligations and other cash commitments efficiently under both normal operating conditions and under periods of Wells Fargo-specific and/or market stress.
To help achieve this objective, the Board establishes liquidity guidelines that require sufficient liquidity to cover potential funding requirements and to avoid over-dependence on volatile, less reliable funding markets. These guidelines are monitored on a monthly basis by the management-level Corporate Asset/Liability Committee and on a quarterly basis by the Board. These guidelines are established and monitored for both the Company and the Parent on a stand-alone basis so that the Parent is a source of strength for its banking subsidiaries. For additional information on liquidity risk and funding management, see the “Risk Management – Liquidity Risk and Funding” section in our 2024 Form 10-K.
Liquidity Standards.
We are subject to a rule issued by the FRB, OCC and FDIC that establishes a quantitative minimum liquidity requirement, known as the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR). The rule requires a covered banking organization to hold high-quality liquid assets (HQLA) in an amount equal to or greater than its projected net cash outflows during a 30-day stress period. Our HQLA under the rule mainly consists of central bank deposits, government debt securities, and mortgage-backed securities of federal agencies. The LCR applies to the Company and to our insured depository institutions (IDIs) with total assets of $10 billion or more. In addition, rules issued by the FRB impose enhanced liquidity risk management standards on large bank holding companies (BHCs), such as Wells Fargo.
We are also subject to a rule issued by the FRB, OCC and FDIC that establishes a stable funding requirement, known as the net stable funding ratio (NSFR), which requires a covered banking organization, such as Wells Fargo, to maintain a minimum amount of stable funding, including common equity, long-term debt and most types of deposits, in relation to its assets, derivative exposures and commitments over a one-year horizon period. The NSFR applies to the Company and to our IDIs with total assets of $10 billion or more. As of March 31, 2025, we were compliant with the NSFR requirement.
Risk Management – Asset/Liability Management
(continued)
Liquidity Coverage Ratio.
As of March 31, 2025, the Company, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., and Wells Fargo National Bank West exceeded the minimum LCR requirement of 100%. The LCR represents average HQLA divided by average projected net cash outflows, as each is defined under the LCR rule.
Table 24 presents the Company’s quarterly average values for the daily-calculated LCR and its components calculated pursuant to the LCR rule requirements.
Table 24:
Liquidity Coverage Ratio
(1)
HQLA excludes excess HQLA at certain subsidiaries that is not transferable to other Wells Fargo entities.
(2)
Net of applicable haircuts required under the LCR rule.
(3)
Projected net cash outflows are calculated by applying a standardized set of outflow and inflow assumptions, defined by the LCR rule, to various exposures and liability types, such as deposits and unfunded loan commitments, which are prescribed based on a number of factors, including the type of customer and the nature of the account.
Liquidity Sources.
As of March 31, 2025, the Company had approximately $879.0 billion of total available liquidity sources. Table 25 presents the components of our available liquidity sources.
We maintain primary sources of liquidity in the form of central bank deposits and high-quality liquid debt securities, which collectively totaled $517.9 billion as of March 31, 2025. Our high-quality liquid debt securities presented in Table 25 are substantially the same in composition as HQLA eligible securities under the LCR rule; however, they will generally exceed HQLA eligible securities due to the applicable LCR haircuts and the exclusion of LCR adjustments for excess liquidity that is not transferable from certain subsidiaries.
We believe our high-quality liquid debt securities provide reliable sources of liquidity through sales or by pledging to obtain financing, in both normal and stressed market conditions. High-quality liquid debt securities include AFS, HTM, and trading debt securities, as well as debt securities received through securities financing activities.
As of March 31, 2025, we had approximately $595.2 billion of borrowing capacity at the Federal Reserve Discount Window and Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLB). This borrowing capacity included $234.1 billion related to pledged high-quality liquid debt securities within our primary sources of liquidity and $361.1 billion related to pledged loans and other debt securities within our contingent sources of liquidity.
Table 25:
Total Available Liquidity Sources

Presented at fair value and includes unencumbered securities.
(2)
Presented at borrowing capacity, net of haircuts.
Funding Sources.
The Parent acts as a source of funding for the Company through the issuance of long-term debt and equity. WFC Holdings, LLC (the “IHC”) is an intermediate holding company and subsidiary of the Parent, which provides funding support for the ongoing operational requirements of the Parent and certain of its direct and indirect subsidiaries. For additional information on the IHC, see the “Regulation and Supervision – ‘Living Will’ Requirements and Related Matters” section in our 2024 Form 10-K. Additional subsidiary funding is provided by deposits, short-term borrowings and long-term debt.
Deposits have historically provided a sizable source of relatively low-cost funds. Loans were 67% of total deposits at both March 31, 2025, and December 31, 2024.
Table 26 presents a summary of our short-term borrowings, which generally mature in less than 30 days. The balances of federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase may vary over time due to client activity, our own demand for financing, and our overall mix of liabilities. For additional information on the classification of our short-term borrowings, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to Financial Statements in our 2024 Form 10-K. We pledge certain financial instruments that we own to collateralize repurchase agreements and other securities financings, as well as borrowings from the FHLB. For additional information, see the “Pledged Assets” section of Note 16 (Pledged Assets and Collateral) to Financial Statements in this Report.
Table 26:
Short-Term Borrowings
We access domestic and international capital markets for long-term funding through issuances of registered debt securities, private placements, securitizations, and asset-backed secured funding. We issue long-term debt in a variety of maturities and currencies to achieve cost-efficient funding and to maintain an appropriate maturity profile. Proceeds from securities issued were used for general corporate purposes unless otherwise specified in the applicable prospectus or prospectus supplement, and we expect the proceeds from securities issued in the future will be used for the same purposes. Depending on market
conditions and our liquidity position, we may redeem or repurchase, and subsequently retire, our outstanding debt securities in privately negotiated or open market transactions,
by tender offer, or otherwise. We issued $8.2 billion and redeemed $4.0 billion of long-term debt in April 2025. Table 27 provides the aggregate carrying value of long-term debt maturities (based on contractual payment dates) for the remainder of 2025 and the following years thereafter, as of March 31, 2025.

Credit Ratings.
Investors in the long-term capital markets, as well as other market participants, generally will consider, among other factors, a company’s debt rating in making investment decisions. Rating agencies base their ratings on many quantitative and qualitative factors, including capital adequacy, liquidity, asset quality, business mix, the level and quality of earnings, and rating agency assumptions regarding the probability and extent of federal financial assistance or support for certain large financial institutions. Adverse changes in these factors could result in a reduction of our credit rating; however, our debt securities do not contain credit rating covenants.
There were no actions undertaken by the rating agencies with regard to our credit ratings during first quarter 2025.
See the “Risk Factors” section in our 2024 Form 10-K for additional information regarding our credit ratings and the potential impact a credit rating downgrade would have on our liquidity and operations as well as Note 11 (Derivatives) to Financial Statements in this Report for information regarding additional collateral and funding obligations required for certain derivative instruments in the event our credit ratings were to fall below investment grade.
The credit ratings of the Parent and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as of March 31, 2025, are presented in Table 28.
Table 28:
Credit Ratings as of March 31, 2025
We have an active program for managing capital through a comprehensive process for assessing the Company’s overall capital adequacy. Our objective is to maintain capital at an amount commensurate with our risk profile and risk tolerance objectives, and to meet both regulatory and market expectations. We primarily fund our capital needs through the retention of earnings net of both dividends and share repurchases, as well as through the issuance of preferred stock and long- and short-term debt. For additional information about capital planning, see the “Capital Planning and Stress Testing” section below.
Regulatory Capital Requirements
The Company and each of our IDIs are subject to various regulatory capital adequacy requirements administered by the FRB and the OCC. Risk-based capital rules establish risk-adjusted ratios relating regulatory capital to different categories of assets and off-balance sheet exposures as discussed below.
RISK-BASED CAPITAL AND RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS.
The Company is subject to rules issued by federal banking regulators to implement Basel III capital requirements for U.S. banking organizations. The rules contain two frameworks for calculating capital requirements, a Standardized Approach and an Advanced Approach applicable to certain institutions, including Wells Fargo, and we must calculate our risk-based capital ratios under both approaches. The Company is required to satisfy the risk-based capital ratio requirements to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments.
In July 2023, federal banking regulators issued a proposed rule to implement the final components of Basel III, which would impact risk-based capital requirements for certain banks. The proposed rule would eliminate the current Advanced Approach and replace it with a new expanded risk-based approach for the
measurement of risk-weighted assets, including more granular risk weights for credit risk, a new market risk framework, and a new standardized approach for measuring operational risk. Officials from federal banking regulators have since commented that there may be significant changes to the proposed rule.
Table 29 presents the risk-based capital requirements applicable to the Company under the Standardized Approach and Advanced Approach, respectively, as of March 31, 2025.
In addition to the risk-based capital requirements described in Table 29, if the FRB determines that a period of excessive credit growth is contributing to an increase in systemic risk, a countercyclical buffer of up to 2.50% could be added to the risk-based capital ratio requirements under federal banking regulations. The countercyclical buffer in effect at March 31, 2025, was 0.00%.
The capital conservation buffer is applicable to certain institutions, including Wells Fargo, under the Advanced Approach and is intended to absorb losses during times of economic or financial stress.
The stress capital buffer is calculated based on the decrease in a BHC’s risk-based capital ratios under the severely adverse scenario in the FRB’s annual supervisory stress test and related Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR), plus four quarters of planned common stock dividends. Because the stress capital buffer is calculated annually based on data that can differ over time, our stress capital buffer, and thus our risk-based capital ratio requirements under the Standardized Approach, are subject to change in future periods. Our stress capital buffer for the period October 1, 2024, through September 30, 2025, is 3.80%. In April 2025, the FRB proposed changes to the supervisory stress test process.
Table 29:
Risk-Based Capital Requirements – Standardized and Advanced Approaches
Capital Management
(continued)
As a global systemically important bank (G-SIB), we are also subject to the FRB’s rule implementing an additional capital surcharge between 1.00-4.50% on the risk-based capital ratio requirements of G-SIBs. Under the rule, we must annually calculate our surcharge under two methods and use the higher of the two surcharges. The first method (method one) considers our size, interconnectedness, cross-jurisdictional activity, substitutability, and complexity, consistent with the methodology developed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) and the Financial Stability Board (FSB). The second method (method two) uses similar inputs, but replaces substitutability with use of short-term wholesale funding and will generally result in higher surcharges than under method one. Because the G-SIB capital surcharge is calculated annually based on data that can differ over time, the amount of the surcharge is subject to change in future years. If our annual calculation results in a decrease to our G-SIB capital surcharge, the decrease takes effect the next calendar year. If our annual calculation results in an increase to our G-SIB capital surcharge, the increase takes
effect in two calendar years. Our G-SIB capital surcharge will continue to be 1.50% in 2025. On July 27, 2023, the FRB issued a proposed rule that would impact the methodology used to calculate the G-SIB capital surcharge.
Under the risk-based capital rules, on-balance sheet assets and credit equivalent amounts of derivatives and off-balance sheet items are assigned to one of several broad risk categories according to the obligor, or, if relevant, the guarantor or the nature of any collateral. The aggregate dollar amount in each risk category is then multiplied by the risk weight associated with that category. The resulting weighted values from each of the risk categories are aggregated for determining total risk-weighted assets (RWAs).
The tables that follow provide information about our risk-based capital and related ratios as calculated under Basel III capital rules. Table 30 summarizes our CET1, Tier 1 capital, Total capital, RWAs and capital ratios.
Table 30:
Capital Components and Ratios

(2)
Differences between the approaches are driven by the qualifying amounts of ACL includable in Tier 2 capital. Under the Advanced Approach, eligible credit reserves represented by the amount of qualifying ACL in excess of expected credit losses (using regulatory definitions) is limited to 0.60% of Advanced credit RWAs, whereas the Standardized Approach includes ACL in Tier 2 capital up to 1.25% of Standardized credit RWAs. Under both approaches, any excess ACL is deducted from the respective total RWAs.
Capital Management
(continued)
Table 32 provides the composition and net changes in the components of RWAs under the Standardized and Advanced Approaches.
Table 32:
Risk-Weighted Assets
(1)
RWAs calculated under the Advanced Approach utilize a risk-sensitive methodology, which relies upon the use of internal credit models based upon our experience with internal rating grades. The Advanced Approach also includes an operational risk component, which reflects the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems, or from external events.
Table 33 provides an analysis of changes in CET1.

Analysis of Changes in Common Equity Tier 1

Determined by applying the combined federal statutory rate and composite state income tax rates to the difference between book and tax basis of the respective goodwill and intangible assets at period-end.
TANGIBLE COMMON EQUITY.
We also evaluate our business based on certain ratios that utilize tangible common equity. Tangible common equity is a non-GAAP financial measure and represents total equity less preferred equity, noncontrolling interests, goodwill, certain identifiable intangible assets (other than MSRs) and goodwill and other intangibles on venture capital investments in consolidated portfolio companies, net of applicable deferred taxes. The ratios are (i) tangible book value per common share, which represents tangible common equity divided by common shares outstanding; and (ii) return on average tangible common equity (ROTCE), which represents our
annualized earnings as a percentage of tangible common equity. The methodology of determining tangible common equity may differ among companies. Management believes that tangible book value per common share and return on average tangible common equity, which utilize tangible common equity, are useful financial measures because they enable management, investors, and others to assess the Company’s use of equity.
Table 34 provides a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures.
Table 34:
Tangible Common Equity
(1)
Determined by applying the combined federal statutory rate and composite state income tax rates to the difference between book and tax basis of the respective goodwill and intangible assets at period-end.
LEVERAGE REQUIREMENTS.
As a BHC, we are required to maintain a supplementary leverage ratio (SLR) to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments and maintain a minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio. Table 35 presents the leverage requirements applicable to the Company as of March 31, 2025.
Table 35:
Leverage Requirements Applicable to the Company
In addition, our IDIs are required to maintain an SLR of at least 6.00% to be considered well-capitalized under applicable regulatory capital adequacy rules and maintain a minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4.00%.

(continued)
Table 36 presents information regarding the calculation and components of the Company’s SLR and Tier 1 leverage ratio. At March 31, 2025, each of our IDIs exceeded their applicable SLR requirements.

Adjustment represents other permitted Tier 1 capital deductions and certain other adjustments as determined under capital rule requirements.
(5)

TOTAL LOSS ABSORBING CAPACITY.
As a G-SIB, we are required to have a minimum amount of equity and unsecured long-term debt for purposes of resolvability and resiliency, often referred to as Total Loss Absorbing Capacity (TLAC). U.S. G-SIBs are required to have a minimum amount of TLAC (consisting of CET1 capital and additional Tier 1 capital issued directly by the top-tier or covered BHC plus eligible external long-term debt) to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments as well as a minimum amount of eligible unsecured long-term debt.
The components used to calculate our minimum TLAC and eligible unsecured long-term debt requirements as of March 31, 2025, are presented in Table 37.
Table 37:
Components Used to Calculate TLAC and Eligible Unsecured Long-Term Debt Requirements
In August 2023, the FRB proposed rules that would, among other things, modify the calculation of eligible long-term debt that counts towards the TLAC requirements, which would reduce our TLAC ratios.
Table 38 provides our TLAC and eligible unsecured long-term debt and related ratios.

OTHER REGULATORY CAPITAL AND LIQUIDITY MATTERS.
For information regarding the U.S. implementation of the Basel III LCR and NSFR, see the “Risk Management – Asset/ Liability Management – Liquidity Risk and Funding – Liquidity Standards” section in this Report.
Our principal U.S. broker-dealer subsidiaries, Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, and Wells Fargo Clearing Services, LLC, are subject to regulations to maintain minimum net capital requirements. As of March 31, 2025, these broker-dealer subsidiaries were in compliance with their respective regulatory minimum net capital requirements.
Capital Planning and Stress Testing
Our planned long-term capital structure is designed to meet regulatory and market expectations. We believe that our long-term targeted capital structure enables us to invest in and grow our business, satisfy our customers’ financial needs in varying environments, access markets, and maintain flexibility to return capital to our shareholders. Our long-term targeted capital structure also considers capital levels sufficient to exceed capital requirements, including the G-SIB capital surcharge and the stress capital buffer, as well as potential changes to regulatory requirements for our capital ratios, planned capital actions, changes in our risk profile and other factors. Accordingly, our long-term target capital levels are set above their respective regulatory minimums plus buffers.
During first quarter 2025, we issued $558 million of common stock, substantially all of which was issued in connection with employee compensation and benefits, and we repurchased 45 million shares of common stock at a cost of $3.5 billion. We paid $1.6 billion of common and preferred stock dividends during first quarter 2025.
The FRB capital plan rule establishes capital planning and other requirements that govern capital distributions, including dividends and share repurchases, by certain BHCs, including Wells Fargo. The FRB assesses, among other things, the overall financial condition, risk profile, and capital adequacy of BHCs when evaluating their capital plans.
As part of the annual CCAR, the FRB generates a supervisory stress test. The FRB reviews the supervisory stress test results as required under the Dodd-Frank Act using a common set of capital actions for all large BHCs and also reviews the Company’s proposed capital actions.
Federal banking regulators also require large BHCs and banks to conduct their own stress tests to evaluate whether the institution has sufficient capital to continue to operate during periods of adverse economic and financial conditions.
Securities Repurchases
On July 25, 2023, we announced that the Board authorized a common stock repurchase program of up to $30 billion. Unless modified or revoked by the Board, this authorization does not expire. At March 31, 2025, we had remaining Board authority to repurchase up to approximately $3.8 billion of common stock. In addition, on April 29, 2025, we announced that the Board authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $40 billion of common stock.
Various factors impact the amount and timing of our share repurchases, including the earnings, cash requirements and
financial condition of the Company, the impact to our balance sheet of expected customer activity, our capital requirements and long-term targeted capital structure, the results of supervisory stress tests, market conditions (including the trading price of our stock), and regulatory and legal considerations, including regulatory requirements under the FRB’s capital plan rule. Although we announce when the Board authorizes a share repurchase program, we typically do not give any public notice before we repurchase our shares. Due to the various factors that may impact the amount and timing of our share repurchases and the fact that we may be in the market throughout the year, our share repurchases occur at various prices. We may suspend share repurchase activity at any time.
Furthermore, the Company has a variety of benefit plans in which employees may own or obtain shares of our common stock. The Company may buy shares from these plans to accommodate employee preferences and these purchases are subtracted from our repurchase authority.
For additional information about share repurchases during first quarter 2025, see Part II, Item 2 in this Report.
The U.S. financial services industry is subject to significant regulation and regulatory oversight initiatives. This regulation and oversight may continue to impact how U.S. financial services companies conduct business and may continue to result in increased regulatory compliance costs.
The following supplements our discussion of significant regulations and regulatory oversight initiatives that have affected or may affect our business contained in the “Regulation and Supervision” and “Risk Factors” sections in our 2024 Form 10-K.
Consent Orders and Other Regulatory Actions
The Company is subject to a number of consent orders and other regulatory actions, which may require the Company, among other things, to undertake certain changes to its business, operations, products and services, and risk management practices, and include the following.
Federal Reserve Board Consent Order Regarding Governance Oversight and Compliance and Operational Risk Management.
On February 2, 2018, the Company entered into a consent order with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (FRB). As required by the consent order, the Company’s Board of Directors (Board) submitted to the FRB a plan to further enhance the Board’s governance and oversight of the Company, and the Company submitted to the FRB a plan to further improve the Company’s compliance and operational risk management program. The Company continues to engage with the FRB as the Company works to address the consent order provisions. The consent order also requires the Company, following the FRB’s acceptance and approval of the plans and the Company’s adoption and implementation of the plans, to complete an initial third-party review of the enhancements and improvements provided for in the plans. Until this third-party review is complete and the plans are adopted and implemented to the satisfaction of the FRB, the Company’s total consolidated assets as defined under the consent order will be limited to the level as of
December 31, 2017. Compliance with this asset cap is measured on a two-quarter daily average basis to allow for management of temporary fluctuations. After removal of the asset cap, a second third-party review must also be conducted to assess the efficacy and sustainability of the enhancements and improvements.
Consent Order with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Regarding Compliance Risk Management Program.
On April 20, 2018, the Company entered into a consent order with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) requiring the Company to enhance its compliance risk management program and its management of customer remediation activities. On April 28, 2025, the Company announced the consent order had terminated.
Consent Order with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency Regarding Loss Mitigation Activities.
On September 9, 2021, the Company entered into a consent order with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) requiring the Company to improve the execution, risk management, and oversight of loss mitigation activities in its Home Lending business. On March 17, 2025, the Company announced the OCC had terminated the consent order.
Formal Agreement with the OCC Regarding Anti-Money Laundering and Sanctions Risk Management Practices.
On September 12, 2024, the Company announced that Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. entered into a formal agreement with the OCC requiring the bank to enhance its anti-money laundering and sanctions risk management practices.
Our significant accounting policies are fundamental to understanding our results of operations and financial condition because they require that we use estimates and assumptions that may affect the value of our assets or liabilities and financial results. Five of these policies are critical because they require management to make difficult, subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and because it is likely that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. These policies govern:
•
the allowance for credit losses;
•
fair value measurements;
•
income taxes;
•
liability for legal actions; and
•
goodwill impairment.
Management has discussed these critical accounting policies and the related estimates and judgments with the Board’s Audit Committee. For additional information, see the “Critical Accounting Policies” section and Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to Financial Statements in our 2024 Form 10-K and Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to Financial Statements in this Report.
Table 39 provides significant accounting updates applicable to us that have been issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) but are not yet effective.

ASU 2024-03 – Income Statement– Reporting Comprehensive Income – Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40):
Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses
This document contains forward-looking statements. In addition, we may make forward-looking statements in our other documents filed or furnished with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and our management may make forward-looking statements orally to analysts, investors, representatives of the media and others. Forward-looking statements can be identified by words such as “anticipates,” “intends,” “plans,” “seeks,” “believes,” “estimates,” “expects,” “target,” “projects,” “outlook,” “forecast,” “will,” “may,” “could,” “should,” “can” and similar references to future periods. In particular, forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements we make about: (i) the future operating or financial performance of the Company or any of its businesses, including our outlook for future growth; (ii) our expectations regarding noninterest expense and our efficiency ratio; (iii) future credit quality and performance, including our expectations regarding future loan losses, our allowance for credit losses, and the economic scenarios considered to develop the allowance; (iv) our expectations regarding net interest income and net interest margin; (v) loan growth or the reduction or mitigation of risk in our loan portfolios; (vi) future capital or liquidity levels, ratios or targets; (vii) the expected outcome and impact of legal, regulatory and legislative developments, as well as our expectations regarding compliance therewith; (viii) future common stock dividends, common share repurchases and other uses of capital; (ix) our targeted range for return on assets, return on equity, and return on tangible common equity; (x) expectations regarding our effective income tax rate; (xi) the outcome of contingencies, such as legal actions; (xii) environmental, social and governance related goals or commitments; and (xiii) the Company’s plans, objectives and strategies.
Forward-looking statements are not based on historical facts but instead represent our current expectations and assumptions regarding our business, the economy and other future conditions. Because forward-looking statements relate to the future, they are subject to inherent uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict. Our actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements. We caution you, therefore, against relying on any of these forward-looking statements. They are neither statements of historical fact nor guarantees or assurances of future performance. While there is no assurance that any list of risks and uncertainties or risk factors is complete, important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements include the following, without limitation:
•
current and future economic and market conditions, including the effects of declines in housing prices, high unemployment rates, declines in commercial real estate prices, U.S. fiscal debt, budget and tax matters, geopolitical matters, trade policies, and any slowdown in global economic growth;
•
our capital and liquidity requirements (including under regulatory capital standards, such as the Basel III capital standards) and our ability to generate capital internally or raise capital on favorable terms;
•
current, pending or future legislation or regulation that could have a negative effect on our revenue and businesses, including rules and regulations relating to bank products and financial services;
•
our ability to realize any efficiency ratio or expense target as part of our expense management initiatives, including as a result of business and economic cyclicality, seasonality, changes in our business composition and operating environment, growth in our businesses and/or acquisitions, and unexpected expenses relating to, among other things, litigation and regulatory matters;
•
the effect of the current interest rate environment or changes in interest rates or in the level or composition of our assets or liabilities on our net interest income and net interest margin;
•
significant turbulence or a disruption in the capital or financial markets, which could result in, among other things, a reduction in the availability of funding or increased funding costs, a reduction in our ability to sell or securitize loans, and declines in asset values and/or recognition of impairment of securities held in our debt securities and equity securities portfolios;
•
the effect of a fall in stock market prices on our investment banking business and our fee income from our brokerage and wealth management businesses;
•
negative effects from instances where customers may have experienced financial harm, including on our legal, operational and compliance costs, our ability to engage in certain business activities or offer certain products or services, our ability to keep and attract customers, our ability to attract and retain qualified employees, and our reputation;
•
regulatory matters, including the failure to resolve outstanding matters on a timely basis and the potential impact of new matters, litigation, or other legal actions, which may result in, among other things, additional costs, fines, penalties, restrictions on our business activities, reputational harm, or other adverse consequences;
•
a failure in or breach of our operational or security systems or infrastructure, or those of our third-party vendors or other service providers, including as a result of cyberattacks;
•
the effect of changes in the level of checking or savings account deposits on our funding costs and net interest margin;
•
fiscal and monetary policies of the Federal Reserve Board;
•
changes to tax laws, regulations, and guidance as well as the effect of discrete items on our effective income tax rate;
•
our ability to develop and execute effective business plans and strategies; and
•
the other risk factors and uncertainties described under “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024.
In addition to the above factors, we also caution that the amount and timing of any future common stock dividends or repurchases will depend on the earnings, cash requirements and financial condition of the Company, the impact to our balance sheet of expected customer activity, our capital requirements and long-term targeted capital structure, the results of supervisory stress tests, market conditions (including the trading price of our stock), regulatory and legal considerations, including regulatory requirements under the Federal Reserve Board’s capital plan rule, and other factors deemed relevant by the Company, and may be subject to regulatory approval or conditions.
For additional information about factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations, refer to our reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the discussion under “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and available on its website at www.sec.gov.
1
Any forward-looking statement made by us speaks only as of the date on which it is made. Factors or events that could cause our actual results to differ may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all of them. We undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise, except as may be required by law.
Forward-looking Non-GAAP Financial Measures
. From time to time management may discuss forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures, such as forward-looking estimates or targets for return on average tangible common equity. We are unable to provide a reconciliation of forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures because we are unable to provide, without unreasonable effort, a meaningful or accurate calculation or estimation of amounts that would be necessary for the reconciliation due to the complexity and inherent difficulty in forecasting and quantifying future amounts or when they may occur. Such unavailable information could be significant to future results.
An investment in the Company involves risk, including the possibility that the value of the investment could fall substantially and that dividends or other distributions on the investment could be reduced or eliminated. For a discussion of risk factors that could adversely affect our financial results and condition, and the value of, and return on, an investment in the Company, we refer you to the “Risk Factors” section in our 2024 Form 10-K.
The Company’s management evaluated the effectiveness, as of March 31, 2025, of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures. The Company’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer participated in the evaluation. Based on this evaluation, the Company’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of March 31, 2025.
Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the Company’s principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the Company’s Board, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and includes those policies and procedures that:
•
pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of assets of the Company;
•
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and
•
provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. No change occurred during first quarter 2025 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

Notes to Financial Statements
See the “Glossary of Acronyms” at the end of this Report for terms used throughout the Financial Statements and related Notes.
Wells Fargo & Company is a leading financial services company. We provide a diversified set of banking, investment and mortgage products and services, as well as consumer and commercial finance, to individuals, businesses and institutions throughout the U.S., and in countries outside the U.S. When we refer to “Wells Fargo,” “the Company,” “we,” “our” or “us,” we mean Wells Fargo & Company and Subsidiaries (consolidated). Wells Fargo & Company (the Parent) is a financial holding company and a bank holding company.
Our accounting and reporting policies conform with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and practices in the financial services industry. For a discussion of our significant accounting policies, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024 (2024 Form 10-K). There were no material changes to these policies in first quarter 2025.
To prepare the financial statements in conformity with GAAP, management must make estimates based on assumptions about future economic and market conditions (for example, unemployment, market liquidity, real estate prices, etc.) that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, income and expenses during the reporting period and the related disclosures. Although our estimates contemplate current conditions and how we expect them to change in the future, it is reasonably possible that actual conditions could be worse than anticipated in those estimates, which could materially affect our results of operations and financial condition. Management has made significant estimates in several areas, including:
•
allowance for credit losses (Note 5 (Loans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses) and Note 3 (Available-for-Sale and Held-to-Maturity Debt Securities));
•
fair value measurements (Note 6 (Mortgage Banking Activities) and Note 12 (Fair Value Measurements));
•
liability for legal actions (Note 10 (Legal Actions));
•
income taxes; and
•
goodwill impairment (Note 7 (Intangible Assets and Other Assets)).
Actual results could differ from those estimates.
These unaudited interim financial statements reflect all adjustments that are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair statement of the results for the periods presented. These adjustments are of a normal recurring nature, unless otherwise disclosed in this Form 10-Q. The results of operations in the interim financial statements do not necessarily indicate the results that may be expected for the full year. The interim financial information should be read in conjunction with our 2024 Form 10-K.
Accounting Standards Adopted in 2025
We did not adopt any accounting standards in first quarter 2025.
Subsequent Events
We have evaluated the effects of events that have occurred subsequent to March 31, 2025, and there have been no material events that would require recognition in our first quarter 2025 consolidated financial statements or disclosure in the Notes to the consolidated financial statements.
Table 2.1 presents a summary of our trading assets and liabilities measured at fair value through earnings.
Table 2.1:
Trading Assets and Liabilities
(1)
Represents balance sheet netting for trading derivative asset and liability balances, and trading portfolio level valuation adjustments. See Note 11 (Derivatives) for additional information.
Table 2.2 provides net interest income earned from trading assets and liabilities, and net gains and losses due to the realized and unrealized gains and losses from trading activities.
Net interest income also includes dividend income on trading securities and dividend expense on trading securities we have sold, but not yet purchased.
Table 2.2:
Net Interest Income and Net Gains (Losses) from Trading Activities
(1)
Substantially all relates to interest income on debt and equity securities.
(2)
Includes gains (losses) on trading portfolio level valuation adjustments, as well as remeasurement gains (losses) on foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities, including related hedges. See Note 11 (Derivatives) for additional information.
Table 3.1 provides the amortized cost, net of the allowance for credit losses (ACL) for debt securities, and fair value by major categories of available-for-sale (AFS) debt securities, which are carried at fair value, and held-to-maturity (HTM) debt securities, which are carried at amortized cost, net of the ACL. The net unrealized gains (losses) for AFS debt securities are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI), net of the ACL and applicable income taxes. Information on debt securities held for trading is included in Note 2 (Trading Activities). For both AFS and HTM debt securities, amortized cost is the unpaid principal amount, net of unamortized basis
adjustments. Basis adjustments may include purchase premiums or discounts, fair value hedge accounting basis adjustments, fair value write-downs related to recognition of intent to sell, impairment losses, and charge-offs or recoveries of amounts deemed uncollectible.
Outstanding balances exclude accrued interest receivable on AFS and HTM debt securities, which are included in other assets. See Note 7 (Intangible Assets and Other Assets) for additional information on accrued interest receivable. Amounts considered to be uncollectible are reversed through interest income.
Table 3.1:
Available-for-Sale and Held-to-Maturity Debt Securities Outstanding

Realized gains and losses relate to AFS debt securities. There were
no
realized gains or losses from HTM debt securities in all periods presented.
Credit Quality
We monitor credit quality of debt securities by evaluating various attributes and utilize such information in our evaluation of the appropriateness of the ACL for debt securities. The credit quality indicators that we most closely monitor include credit ratings and delinquency status and are based on information as of our financial statement date.
CREDIT RATINGS.
Credit ratings express opinions about the credit quality of a debt security. We determine the credit rating of a security according to the lowest credit rating made available by national recognized statistical rating organizations (NRSROs). Debt securities rated investment grade, that is those with ratings similar to BBB-/Baa3 or above, as defined by NRSROs, are generally considered by the rating agencies and market
participants to be low credit risk. Conversely, debt securities rated below investment grade, labeled as “speculative grade” by the rating agencies, are considered to be distinctively higher credit risk than investment grade debt securities. For debt securities not rated by NRSROs, we determine an internal credit grade of the debt securities (used for credit risk management purposes) equivalent to the credit ratings assigned by major credit agencies. Substantially all of our debt securities were rated by NRSROs at March 31, 2025, and December 31, 2024.
Table 3.4 shows the percentage of fair value of AFS debt securities and amortized cost of HTM debt securities determined to be rated investment grade, inclusive of securities rated based on internal credit grades.
Table 3.4:
Investment Grade Debt Securities
(1)
99
% were rated AA- and above at both March 31, 2025, and December 31, 2024.
(2)
Includes federal agency mortgage-backed securities.
(3)
100
% were rated AA- and above at both March 31, 2025, and December 31, 2024.
(4)
Includes non-U.S. government, non-agency mortgage-backed, and all other debt securities.
DELINQUENCY STATUS AND NONACCRUAL DEBT SECURITIES.
Debt security issuers that are delinquent in payment of amounts due under contractual debt agreements have a higher probability of recognition of credit losses. As such, as part of our monitoring of the credit quality of the debt security portfolio, we consider whether debt securities we own are past due in payment of principal or interest payments and whether any securities have been placed into nonaccrual status.
Debt securities that are past due and still accruing or in nonaccrual status were insignificant at both March 31, 2025, and December 31, 2024. Net charge-offs on debt securities were insignificant in the first quarter of both 2025 and 2024.
Note 3:
Available-for-Sale and Held-to-Maturity Debt Securities
(continued)
Unrealized Losses of Available-for-Sale Debt Securities
Table 3.5 shows the gross unrealized losses and fair value of AFS debt securities by length of time those individual securities in each category have been in a continuous loss position. Debt securities on which we have recorded credit impairment are
categorized as being “less than 12 months” or “12 months or more” in a continuous loss position based on the point in time that the fair value declined to below the amortized cost basis, net of the allowance for credit losses.
Table 3.5:
Gross Unrealized Losses and Fair Value – Available-for-Sale Debt Securities
(1)
Gross unrealized losses exclude portfolio level basis adjustments.
We have assessed each debt security with gross unrealized losses included in the previous table for credit impairment. As part of that assessment we evaluated and concluded that we do not intend to sell any of the debt securities, and that it is more likely than not that we will not be required to sell, prior to recovery of the amortized cost basis. We evaluate, where necessary, whether credit impairment exists by comparing the present value of the expected cash flows to the debt securities’ amortized cost basis. Credit impairment is recorded as an ACL for debt securities.
For descriptions of the factors we consider when analyzing debt securities for impairment as well as methodology and significant inputs used to measure credit losses, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) in our 2024 Form 10-K.
Contractual Maturities
Table 3.6 and Table 3.7 show the remaining contractual maturities of AFS and HTM debt securities, respectively.
Table 3.6:
Contractual Maturities – Available-for-Sale Debt Securities
(1)
Amortized cost, net excludes portfolio level basis adjustments of $
59
million.
(2)
Weighted average yields are calculated using the effective yield method and are weighted based on amortized cost, net of ACL. The effective yield method is calculated using the contractual coupon and the impact of any premiums and discounts and is shown pre-tax. We have not included the effect of any related hedging derivatives. The effective yield for mortgage-backed securities excludes unscheduled principal payments, and remaining expected maturities will differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to prepay obligations before the underlying mortgages mature.

Table 5.1 presents total loans outstanding by portfolio segment and class of financing receivable. Loans are reported at their outstanding principal balances net of any unearned income, cumulative charge-offs, unamortized deferred fees and costs on originated loans, and unamortized premiums or discounts on purchased loans. These amounts were less than
1
% of our total loans outstanding at both March 31, 2025, and December 31, 2024.
Outstanding balances exclude accrued interest receivable on loans, except for certain revolving loans, such as credit card loans.
See Note 7 (Intangible Assets and Other Assets) for additional information on accrued interest receivable. Amounts considered to be uncollectible are reversed through interest income. During first quarter 2025, we reversed accrued interest receivable of $
19
million for our commercial portfolio segment and $
102
million for our consumer portfolio segment, compared with $
15
million and $
96
million, respectively, for the same period a year ago.
Table 5.1:
Loans Outstanding
(1)
Includes $
21.7
billion and $
21.4
billion at March 31, 2025, and December 31, 2024, respectively, of securities-based loans originated by the Wealth and Investment Management (WIM) operating segment.
Our non-U.S. loans are reported by respective class of financing receivable in the table above. Substantially all of our non-U.S. loan portfolio is commercial loans. Table 5.2 presents total non-U.S. commercial loans outstanding by class of financing receivable.

Loan Purchases, Sales, and Transfers
Table 5.3 presents the proceeds paid or received for purchases and sales of loans and transfers from loans held for investment to mortgages/loans held for sale. The table excludes loans for
which we have elected the fair value option and government insured/guaranteed loans because their loan activity normally does not impact the ACL.

Unfunded Credit Commitments
Unfunded credit commitments are legally binding agreements to lend to customers with terms covering usage of funds, contractual interest rates, expiration dates, and any required collatera
l. Our commercial lending commitments include, but are not limited to, (i) commitments for working capital and general corporate purposes, (ii) financing to customers who warehouse financial assets secured by real estate, consumer, or corporate loans, (iii) financing that is expected to be syndicated or replaced with other forms of long-term financing, and (iv) commercial real estate lending. We also originate multipurpose lending commitments under which commercial customers have the option to draw on the facility in one of several forms, including the issuance of letters of credit, which reduces the unfunded commitment amounts of the facility.
The maximum credit risk for these commitments will generally be lower than the contractual amount because these commitments may expire without being used or may be cancelled at the customer’s request. We may reduce or cancel lines of credit in accordance with the contracts and applicable law. Our credit risk monitoring activities include managing the amount of commitments, both to individual customers and in total, and the size and maturity structure of these commitments. We do not recognize an ACL for commitments that are unconditionally cancellable at our discretion.
We issue commercial letters of credit to assist customers in purchasing goods or services, typically for international trade. At March 31, 2025, and December 31, 2024, we had $
945
million and $
968
million, respectively, of outstanding issued commercial letters of credit. See Note 14 (Guarantees and Other Commitments) for additional information on issued standby letters of credit.
We may be a fronting bank, whereby we act as a representative for other lenders, and advance funds or provide for the issuance of letters of credit under syndicated loan or letter of credit agreements. Any advances are generally repaid in less than a week and would normally require default of both the customer and another lender to expose us to loss.
The contractual amount of our unfunded credit commitments, including unissued letters of credit, is summarized in Table 5.4. The table is presented net of commitments syndicated to others, including the fronting arrangements described above, and excludes issued letters of credit and discretionary amounts where our approval or consent is required prior to any loan funding or commitment increase.
Table 5.4:
Unfunded Credit Commitments

Includes lines of credit totaling
$
21.0
billion
and $
22.5
billion as of
March 31, 2025,
and December 31, 2024, respectively.
Allowance for Credit Losses
Table 5.5 presents the ACL for loans, which consists of the allowance for loan losses and the allowance for unfunded credit commitments. Total net loan charge-offs decreased $
140
million from March 31, 2024, due to lower losses in our commercial real estate portfolio driven by the office property type, as well as lower losses in our commercial and industrial, auto and other
consumer portfolios, partially offset by higher losses in our credit card portfolio. The ACL for loans decreased $
84
million from December 31, 2024, reflecting a lower allowance for commercial real estate loans on lower loan balances, partially offset by a higher allowance for commercial and industrial loans.
Table 5.5:
Allowance for Credit Losses for Loans
Note 5:
Loans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses
(continued)
Table 5.6 summarizes the activity in the ACL by our commercial and consumer portfolio segments.
Table 5.6:
Allowance for Credit Losses for Loans Activity by Portfolio Segment
Credit Quality
We monitor credit quality by evaluating various attributes and utilize such information in our evaluation of the appropriateness of the ACL for loans. The following sections provide the credit quality indicators we most closely monitor. The credit quality indicators are generally based on information as of our financial statement date.
COMMERCIAL CREDIT QUALITY INDICATORS.
We manage a consistent process for assessing commercial loan credit quality. Commercial loans are generally subject to individual risk assessment using our internal borrower and collateral quality ratings, which is our primary credit quality indicator. Our ratings are aligned to regulatory definitions of pass and criticized categories with the criticized segmented among special mention, substandard, doubtful, and loss categories.
Table 5.7 provides the outstanding balances of our commercial loan portfolio by risk category and credit quality information by origination year for term loans. Revolving loans may convert to term loans as a result of a contractual provision in the original loan agreement or if modified for a borrower experiencing financial difficulty. At March 31, 2025, we had $
506.1
billion and $
34.6
billion of pass and criticized commercial loans, respectively. Gross charge-offs by loan class are included in the following table for the quarter ended March 31, 2025, and year ended December 31, 2024, which we monitor as part of our credit risk management practices; however, charge-offs are not a primary credit quality indicator for our loan portfolio.
Table 5.7:
Commercial Loan Categories by Risk Categories and Vintage
(1)
Includes charge-offs on overdrafts, which are generally charged-off at 60 days past due.
Note 5:
Loans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses
(continued)
Table 5.8 provides days past due (DPD) information for commercial loans, which we monitor as part of our credit risk management practices; however, delinquency is not a primary credit quality indicator for commercial loans.
Table 5.8:
Commercial Loan Categories by Delinquency Status
CONSUMER CREDIT QUALITY INDICATORS.
We have various classes of consumer loans that present unique credit risks. Loan delinquency, Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) credit scores and loan-to-value (LTV) for residential mortgage loans are the primary credit quality indicators that we monitor and utilize in our evaluation of the appropriateness of the ACL for the consumer loan portfolio segment.
Many of our loss estimation techniques used for the ACL for loans rely on delinquency-based models; therefore, delinquency is an important indicator of credit quality in the establishment of our ACL for consumer loans.
We obtain FICO scores at loan origination and the scores are generally updated at least quarterly, except in limited circumstances, including compliance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA). FICO scores are not available for certain loan types or may not be required if we deem it unnecessary due to strong collateral and other borrower attributes.
LTV is the ratio of the outstanding loan balance divided by the property collateral value. For junior lien mortgages, we use the total combined loan balance of first and junior lien mortgages (including unused line of credit amounts). We obtain LTVs using a cascade approach which first uses values provided by automated valuation models (AVMs) for the property. If an AVM is not available, then the value is estimated using the original appraised value adjusted by the change in Home Price Index (HPI) for the property location. If an HPI is not available, the original appraised value is used. The HPI value is normally the only method considered for high value properties, generally with an original value of $
1.5
million or more, as the AVM values have proven less accurate for these properties. Generally, we update LTVs on a quarterly basis. Certain loans do not have an LTV due to a lack of industry data availability and portfolios acquired from or serviced by other institutions.
Gross charge-offs by loan class are included in the following tables for the quarter ended March 31, 2025, and year ended December 31, 2024, which we monitor as part of our credit risk management practices; however, charge-offs are not a primary credit quality indicator for our loan portfolio.
Credit quality information is provided with the year of origination for term loans. Revolving loans may convert to term loans as a result of a contractual provision in the original loan agreement or if modified for a borrower experiencing financial difficulty.
Table 5.9 provides the outstanding balances of our residential mortgage loans by our primary credit quality indicators.
Table 5.9:
Credit Quality Indicators for Residential Mortgage Loans by Vintage
(1)
Represents residential mortgage loans whose repayments are insured or guaranteed by U.S. government agencies, such as the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) or the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). Loans insured/guaranteed by U.S. government agencies and 90+ DPD totaled $
2.6
billion and $
2.8
billion at March 31, 2025, and December 31, 2024, respectively.

(1)
Substantially all loans are revolving securities-based loans originated by the WIM operating segment and therefore do not require a FICO score.
(2)
Includes charge-offs on overdrafts, which are generally charged-off at 60 days past due.
NONACCRUAL LOANS.
Table 5.13 provides loans on nonaccrual status. Nonaccrual loans may have an ACL or a negative allowance for credit losses from expected recoveries of amounts previously written off.
Table 5.13:
Nonaccrual Loans
(1)
Nonaccrual loans may not have an allowance for credit losses if the loss expectations are zero given the related collateral value.
LOANS IN PROCESS OF FORECLOSURE.
Our recorded investment in consumer mortgage loans collateralized by residential real estate property that are in process of foreclosure was $
786
million and $
705
million at March 31, 2025, and December 31, 2024, respectively, which included $
623
million and $
540
million, respectively, of loans that are government insured/guaranteed. Under the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau guidelines, we do not commence the foreclosure process on residential mortgage loans until after the loan is 120 days delinquent. Foreclosure procedures and timelines vary depending on whether the property address resides in a judicial or non-judicial state. Judicial states require the foreclosure to be processed through the state’s courts while non-judicial states are processed without court intervention. Foreclosure timelines vary according to state law.
LOANS 90 DAYS OR MORE PAST DUE AND STILL ACCRUING.
Certain loans 90 days or more past due are still accruing, because they are (1) well-secured and in the process of collection or (2) residential mortgage or consumer loans exempt under regulatory rules from being classified as nonaccrual until later delinquency, usually 120 days past due.
Table 5.14 shows loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing by class for loans not government insured/guaranteed.

LOAN MODIFICATIONS TO BORROWERS EXPERIENCING FINANCIAL DIFFICULTY.
We may agree to modify the contractual terms of a loan to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty.
The following disclosures provide information on loan modifications in the form of principal forgiveness, interest rate reductions, other-than-insignificant (e.g., greater than three months) payment delays, term extensions or a combination of these modifications, as well as the financial effects of these modifications, and loan performance in the twelve months following the modification. Loans that both modify and are paid off or charged-off during the period are not included in the disclosures below. These disclosures do not include loans
discharged by a bankruptcy court as the only concession, which were insignificant for the first quarter of both 2025 and 2024.
For additional information on our loan modifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty, see Note 5 (Loans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses) in our 2024 Form 10-K.
Table 5.15 presents the outstanding balance of modified commercial loans and the related financial effects of these modifications. At the time of modification, we may require that the borrower provide additional economic support, such as partial repayment, additional collateral, or guarantees.
Table 5.15:
Commercial Loan Modifications and Financial Effects
Commercial loans that received a modification in the past 12 months as of March 31, 2025 and 2024, and subsequently defaulted in the first quarter of both periods were insignificant.
Table 5.16 provides past due information on commercial loans that received a modification in the past 12 months as of
March 31, 2025 and 2024, and the amount of related gross charge-offs during the first quarter of both 2025 and 2024. For loan modifications that include a payment deferral, payment performance is not included in the table below until the loan exits the deferral period and payments resume.
Table 5.16:
Payment Performance of Commercial Loan Modifications
Table 5.17 presents the outstanding balance of modified consumer loans and the related financial effects of these modifications. Modified loans within the Auto and Other consumer loan classes were insignificant for the first quarter of both 2025 and 2024, and accordingly, are excluded from the following tables and disclosures.
Loans in a trial payment period are not included in the following loan modification disclosures until the borrower has successfully completed the trial period and the loan modification is formally executed. Residential mortgage loans in a trial payment period totaled $
111
million and $
116
million at March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively.
Table 5.17:
Consumer Loan Modifications and Financial Effects
(1)
Payment delay modifications include loan modifications that defer a set amount of principal to the end of the loan term. The outstanding balance of loans with principal deferred to the end of the loan term was $
94
million and $
96
million in first quarter 2025 and 2024, respectively.
(2)
Excludes the financial effects of loans with a set amount of principal deferred to the end of the loan term. The weighted average period of principal deferred was
25.0
years and
23.7
years in first quarter 2025 and 2024, respectively.
Note 5:
Loans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses
(continued)
Consumer loans that received a modification within the past 12 months as of March 31, 2025 and 2024, and subsequently defaulted in the first quarter of both periods, totaled $
100
million and $
111
million, respectively.
Table 5.18 provides past due information as of March 31, 2025 and 2024, for consumer loan modifications that received a modification in the past 12 months, and the related gross charge-offs that occurred on these modifications during the first quarter of both 2025 and 2024.
Table 5.18:
Payment Performance of Consumer Loan Modifications
(1)
Loan modifications in an active payment deferral are excluded. Includes loans where delinquency status was not reset to current upon exit from the deferral period.
(2)
Credit card loans that are past due at the time of the modification do not become current until they have three consecutive months of payment performance.
Commitments to lend additional funds on commercial loans modified during the first quarter of 2025 and 2024, were $
102
million and $
142
million, respectively, the majority of which were in the commercial real estate portfolio. Commitments to lend additional funds on consumer loans modified during the first quarter of both 2025 and 2024, were insignificant.
Mortgage banking activities consist of residential and commercial mortgage originations, sales and servicing.
We apply the fair value method to residential mortgage servicing rights (MSRs) and apply the amortization method to commercial
MSRs.
Table 6.1 presents MSRs, including the changes in MSRs measured using the fair value method and the amortization method.
Table 6.1:
Mortgage Servicing Rights
(1)
Includes prepayment rate changes due to changes in market interest rates. Residential MSRs are economically hedged with derivative instruments to reduce exposure to changes in market interest rates.
(2)
Represents other changes in valuation model inputs or assumptions, including prepayment rate estimation changes that are independent of mortgage interest rate changes.
(3)
Represents the reduction in the residential MSR fair value for the cash flows expected to be collected during the period, net of income accreted due to the passage of time.
(4)
The estimated fair value of commercial MSRs was $
780
million and $
1.7
billion at March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively. In first quarter 2025, we sold the non-agency portion of our commercial mortgage third-party servicing business.
Table 6.2 provides key weighted-average assumptions used in the valuation of residential MSRs and sensitivity of the current fair value of residential MSRs to immediate adverse changes in
those assumptions. See Note 12 (Fair Value Measurements) for additional information on key assumptions for residential MSRs.
Table 6.2:
Assumptions and Sensitivity of Residential MSRs
(1)
Includes a blend of prepayment speeds and expected defaults. Prepayment speeds are influenced by mortgage interest rates as well as our estimation of drivers of borrower behavior.
Note 6:
Mortgage Banking Activities
(continued)
The sensitivities in the preceding table are hypothetical and caution should be exercised when relying on this data. Changes in value based on variations in assumptions generally cannot be extrapolated because the relationship of the change in the assumption to the change in value may not be linear. Also, the effect of a variation in a particular assumption on the value of the other interests held is calculated independently without changing any other assumptions. In reality, changes in one factor may result in changes in others, which might magnify or counteract the sensitivities.
We present information for our managed servicing portfolio in Table 6.3 using unpaid principal balance for loans serviced and subserviced for others and carrying value for owned loans serviced.
As the servicer of loans for others, we advance certain payments of principal, interest, taxes, insurance, and default-related expenses. The credit risk related to these advances is limited since the reimbursement is generally senior to cash payments to investors and are generally reimbursed within a short timeframe from cash flows from the trust, government-sponsored enterprise (GSEs), insurer, or borrower. We maintain an allowance for uncollectible amounts for advances on loans serviced for others that may not be reimbursed if the payments were not made in accordance with applicable servicing agreements or if the insurance or servicing agreements contain limitations on reimbursements. We also advance payments of taxes and insurance for our owned loans which are collectible from the borrower. Servicer advances on owned loans are written-off when deemed uncollectible.

We are authorized to issue
20
million shares of preferred stock, without par value. Outstanding preferred shares rank senior to common shares both as to the payment of dividends and liquidation preferences but have no general voting rights. All outstanding preferred stock with a liquidation preference value, except for Series L Preferred Stock, may be redeemed for the liquidation preference value, plus any accrued but unpaid dividends, on any dividend payment date on or after the earliest redemption date for that series. Additionally, these same series of preferred stock may be redeemed following a “regulatory
capital treatment event,” as described in the terms of each series. Capital actions, including redemptions of our preferred stock, may be subject to regulatory approval or conditions.
In addition, we are authorized to issue
4
million shares of preference stock, without par value. We have
not
issued any preference shares under this authorization. If issued, preference shares would be limited to
one
vote per share.
Table 9.1 summarizes information about our preferred stock.

Wells Fargo and certain of our subsidiaries are involved in a number of judicial, regulatory, governmental, arbitration, and other proceedings or investigations concerning matters arising from the conduct of our business activities, and many of those proceedings and investigations expose Wells Fargo to potential financial loss or other adverse consequences. These proceedings and investigations include actions brought against Wells Fargo and/or our subsidiaries with respect to corporate-related matters and transactions in which Wells Fargo and/or our subsidiaries were involved. In addition, Wells Fargo and our subsidiaries may be requested to provide information to or otherwise cooperate with government authorities in the conduct of investigations of other persons or industry groups. We establish accruals for legal actions when potential losses associated with the actions become probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. For such accruals, we record the amount we consider to be the best estimate within a range of potential losses that are both probable and estimable; however, if we cannot determine a best estimate, then we record the low end of the range of those potential losses. There can be no assurance as to the ultimate outcome of legal actions, including the matters described below, and the actual costs of resolving legal actions may be substantially higher or lower than the amounts accrued for those actions.
ADVISORY ACCOUNT CASH SWEEP LITIGATION.
Putative class actions have been filed in federal district courts alleging that the Company breached its fiduciary duties or agreements with regard to rates paid to investment advisory clients in its cash sweep program. These actions have been consolidated in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California.
ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING AND ECONOMIC SANCTIONS RELATED INVESTIGATIONS.
Government authorities are conducting inquiries or investigations regarding issues related to the Company’s anti-money laundering and sanctions
programs. On September 12, 2024, the Company announced that Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. entered into a formal agreement with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) related to the bank’s anti-money laundering and sanctions risk management practices.
COMPANY 401(K) PLAN LITIGATION.
On September 26, 2022, participants in the Company’s 401(k) plan filed a putative class action in the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota alleging that the Company violated the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 in connection with certain transactions associated with the Employee Stock Ownership Plan feature of the Company’s 401(k) plan, including the manner in which the 401(k) plan purchased certain securities used in connection with the Company’s contributions to the 401(k) plan.
HIRING PRACTICES MATTERS.
Government agencies, including the United States Department of Justice and the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), have undertaken formal or informal inquiries or investigations regarding the Company’s hiring practices related to diversity. The United States Department of Justice and the SEC have since closed their investigations without taking action. A putative securities fraud class action has also been filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California alleging that the Company and certain of its executive officers made false or misleading
statements about the Company’s hiring practices related to diversity. Allegations related to the Company’s hiring practices related to diversity are also among the subjects of a shareholder derivative lawsuit pending in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California.
HOME MORTGAGE DISCRIMINATION LITIGATION.
Plaintiffs representing a class of home mortgage applicants and customers filed putative class actions against Wells Fargo alleging that Wells Fargo’s mortgage lending policies and practices resulted in disparate treatment and disparate impact against minority applicants. These actions have been consolidated in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California.
INTERCHANGE LITIGATION.
Plaintiffs representing a class of merchants have filed putative class actions, and individual merchants have filed individual actions, alleging that Visa and Mastercard, as well as certain payment card issuing banks including Wells Fargo, unlawfully colluded to set interchange rates associated with Visa and Mastercard payment card transactions and that enforcement of certain Visa and Mastercard rules and alleged tying and bundling of services offered to merchants were anticompetitive. These actions have been consolidated in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York. Wells Fargo, along with other defendants and entities, are parties to loss and judgment sharing agreements, which provide that they, along with other entities, will share, based on a formula, in any losses or judgments from the relevant litigation. In July 2012, Visa, Mastercard, and the financial institution defendants, including Wells Fargo, agreed to pay a total of approximately $
6.6
billion in order to settle the consolidated action. Several merchants opted out of the settlement and are pursuing individual actions. In June 2016, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit vacated the settlement agreement and reversed and remanded the consolidated action to the district court for further proceedings. In November 2016, the district court appointed lead class counsel for a damages class and an equitable relief class. The parties entered into a settlement agreement to resolve the damages class claims pursuant to which defendants agreed to pay a total of approximately $
6.2
billion, which includes approximately $
5.3
billion of funds remaining in escrow from the 2012 settlement and $
900
million in additional funding. Wells Fargo’s allocated responsibility for the additional funding is approximately $
94.5
million. The court granted final approval of the settlement on December 13, 2019, which was affirmed by the Second Circuit on March 15, 2023. On September 27, 2021, the district court granted the plaintiffs’ motion for class certification in the equitable relief case. On March 26, 2024, Visa and Mastercard entered into a settlement agreement to resolve the equitable relief class claims, which was denied by the district court on June 25, 2024. Some of the opt-out and direct-action cases have been settled while others remain pending.
SEMINOLE TRIBE TRUSTEE LITIGATION.
The Seminole Tribe of Florida filed a complaint in Florida state court alleging that Wells Fargo, as trustee, charged excess fees in connection with the administration of a minor’s trust and failed to invest the assets of the trust prudently. The complaint was later amended to include
three
individual current and former beneficiaries as plaintiffs and to remove the Tribe as a party to the case. In March 2025, a trial verdict was entered against Wells Fargo. If post-trial motions are denied, Wells Fargo plans to appeal.
ZELLE LITIGATION.
On December 20, 2024, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Arizona against multiple financial services companies, including Wells Fargo, regarding fund transfers made through the Zelle Network. On March 4, 2025, the CFPB dismissed its lawsuit with prejudice.
OUTLOOK.
As described above, the Company establishes accruals for legal actions when potential losses associated with the actions become probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. The high end of the range of reasonably possible losses in excess of the Company’s accrual for probable and estimable losses was approximately $
2.0
billion as of March 31, 2025. The outcomes of legal actions are unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties, and it is inherently difficult to determine whether any loss is probable or even possible. It is also inherently difficult to estimate the amount of any loss and there may be matters for which a loss is probable or reasonably possible but not currently estimable. Accordingly, actual losses may be in excess of the established accrual or the range of reasonably possible loss. Based on information currently available, advice of counsel, available insurance coverage, and established reserves, Wells Fargo believes that the eventual outcome of the actions against Wells Fargo and/or its subsidiaries will not, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on Wells Fargo’s consolidated financial condition. However, it is possible that the ultimate resolution of a matter, if unfavorable, may be material to Wells Fargo’s results of operations for any particular period.
We use derivatives to manage exposure to market risk, including interest rate risk, credit risk and foreign currency risk, and to assist customers with their risk management objectives. We designate certain derivatives as hedging instruments in qualifying hedge accounting relationships (fair value or cash flow hedges). Our remaining derivatives consist of economic hedges that do not qualify for, or we have elected not to apply, hedge accounting and derivatives held for customer accommodation trading purposes. For additional information on our derivative activities, see Note 14 (Derivatives) in our 2024 Form 10-K.
Table 11.1 presents the total notional or contractual amounts and fair values for our derivatives. Derivative transactions can be measured in terms of the notional amount, but this amount is not recorded on our consolidated balance sheet and is not, when viewed in isolation, a meaningful measure of the risk profile of the instruments. The notional amount is generally not exchanged, but is used only as the basis on which derivative cash flows are determined.
Table 11.1:
Notional or Contractual Amounts and Fair Values of Derivatives
Balance Sheet Offsetting
We execute substantially all of our derivative transactions under master netting arrangements. When legally enforceable, these master netting arrangements give the ability, in the event of default by the counterparty, to liquidate securities held as collateral and to offset receivables and payables with the same counterparty. We reflect all derivative balances and related cash collateral subject to legally enforceable master netting arrangements on a net basis on our consolidated balance sheet. We do not net non-cash collateral that we receive or pledge against derivative balances on our consolidated balance sheet.
For disclosure purposes, we present “Total derivatives, net” which represents the aggregate of our net exposure to each counterparty after considering the balance sheet netting adjustments and any non-cash collateral. We manage derivative exposure by monitoring the credit risk associated with each counterparty using counterparty-specific credit risk limits, using master netting arrangements and obtaining collateral.
Table 11.2 provides information on the fair values of derivative assets and liabilities subject to legally enforceable master netting arrangements with the same counterparty, the balance sheet netting adjustments and the resulting net fair value amount recorded on our consolidated balance sheet, as well as the non-cash collateral associated with such arrangements. In addition to the netting amounts included in the table, we also have balance sheet netting related to resale and repurchase agreements that are disclosed within Note 15 (Securities Financing Activities).
Table 11.2:
Offsetting of Derivative Assets and Liabilities
(1)
Represents amounts with counterparties subject to enforceable master netting arrangements that have been offset in our consolidated balance sheet, including portfolio level valuation adjustments related to customer accommodation and other trading derivatives. These valuation adjustments were primarily related to interest rate and foreign exchange contracts. Table 11.7
and Table 11.8 present information related to derivative valuation adjustments.
Fair Value and Cash Flow Hedges
For fair value hedges, we use interest rate swaps to convert certain of our fixed-rate long-term debt and time certificates of deposit to floating rates to hedge our exposure to interest rate risk. We also enter into cross-currency swaps, cross-currency interest rate swaps and forward contracts to hedge our exposure to foreign currency risk and interest rate risk associated with the issuance of non-U.S. dollar denominated long-term debt. We also enter into futures contracts, forward contracts, and swap contracts to hedge our exposure to the price risk of physical commodities included in other assets on our consolidated balance sheet. In addition, we use interest rate swaps, cross-currency swaps, cross-currency interest rate swaps and forward contracts to hedge against changes in fair value of certain investments in AFS debt securities due to changes in interest rates, foreign currency rates, or both. For certain fair value hedges of interest rate risk, we use the portfolio layer method to hedge stated amounts of closed portfolios of AFS debt securities. For certain fair value hedges of foreign currency risk, changes in fair value of cross-currency swaps attributable to changes in cross-currency basis spreads are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recorded in other comprehensive income (OCI). See Note 21 (Other
Comprehensive Income) for the amounts recognized in other comprehensive income.
For cash flow hedges, we use interest rate swaps to hedge the variability in interest payments received on certain interest-earning deposits with banks and certain floating-rate commercial loans. We also use cross-currency swaps to hedge variability in interest payments on fixed-rate foreign currency-denominated long-term debt due to changes in foreign exchange rates.
We estimate $
451
million pre-tax of deferred net losses related to cash flow hedges in OCI at March 31, 2025, will be reclassified into net interest income during the next twelve months. For cash flow hedges as of March 31, 2025, we are hedging our interest rate and foreign currency exposure to the variability of future cash flows for all forecasted transactions for a maximum of approximately
7
years. For additional information on our accounting hedges, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) in our 2024 Form 10-K.

Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments
Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments include economic hedges and derivatives entered into for customer accommodation trading purposes.
Economic hedge derivatives do not qualify for, or we have elected not to apply, hedge accounting. We use economic hedge derivatives to manage our non-trading exposures to interest rate risk, equity price risk, foreign currency risk, and credit risk.
For additional information on other derivatives, see Note 14 (Derivatives) in our 2024 Form 10-K.
Table 11.6 shows the net gains (losses) related to economic hedge derivatives. Gains (losses) on customer accommodation trading derivatives are excluded from Table 11.6. For additional information, see Note 2 (Trading Activities).

DERIVATIVE VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS.
We incorporate certain adjustments in determining the fair value of our derivatives, including credit valuation adjustments (CVA) to reflect counterparty credit risk related to derivative assets, debit valuation adjustments (DVA) to reflect Wells Fargo’s own credit risk related to derivative liabilities, and funding valuation adjustments (FVA) to reflect the funding cost of uncollateralized or partially collateralized derivative assets and liabilities. CVA, which considers the effects of enforceable master netting agreements and collateral arrangements, reflects market-based views of the credit quality of each counterparty. We estimate CVA based on observed credits spreads in the credit default swap market and indices indicative of the credit quality of the counterparties to our derivatives.
Table 11.7 presents the impact of derivative valuation adjustments (excluding the effect of any related hedges), which are included in net gains (losses) from trading and securities on the consolidated statement of income. For additional information, see Note 2 (Trading Activities).
Table 11.7:
Net Gains (Losses) from Derivative Valuation Adjustments
Table 11.8 presents the impact of derivative valuation adjustments on derivative fair values.
Table 11.8:
Derivative Valuation Adjustments
Sold Credit Derivatives
Credit derivative contracts are arrangements whose value is derived from the transfer of credit risk of a reference asset or entity from one party (the purchaser of credit protection) to another party (the seller of credit protection). We generally use credit derivatives to assist customers with their risk management objectives by purchasing and selling credit protection on corporate debt obligations through the use of credit default swaps or through risk participation swaps to help manage counterparty exposure. We would be required to perform under the credit derivatives we sold in the event of default by the referenced obligors. Events of default include events such as bankruptcy, capital restructuring or lack of principal and/or interest payment.
Table 11.9 provides details of sold credit derivatives.
Table 11.9:
Sold Credit Derivatives
Protection sold represents the estimated maximum exposure to loss that would be incurred if, upon an event of default, the value of our interests and any associated collateral declined to zero, and does not take into consideration any recovery value from the referenced obligation or offset from collateral held or any economic hedges.
The amounts under non-investment grade represent the notional amounts of those credit derivatives on which we have a higher risk of being required to perform under the terms of the credit derivative and are a function of the underlying assets.
We consider the credit risk to be low if the underlying assets under the credit derivative have an external rating that is investment grade. If an external rating is not available, we classify the credit derivative as non-investment grade.
Our maximum exposure to sold credit derivatives is managed through posted collateral, which may include cash and non-cash collateral, and purchased credit derivatives with identical or similar reference positions in order to achieve our desired credit risk profile. Our credit risk management approach is designed to provide the ability to recover amounts that would be paid under sold credit derivatives.
Credit-Risk Contingent Features
Certain of our derivative contracts contain provisions whereby if the credit rating of our debt were to be downgraded by certain major credit rating agencies, the counterparty could demand additional collateral or require termination or replacement of derivative instruments in a net liability position.
Table 11.10 illustrates our exposure to OTC bilateral derivative contracts with credit-risk contingent features, collateral we have posted, and the additional collateral we would be required to post if the credit rating of our debt was downgraded below investment grade.
Table 11.10:
Credit-Risk Contingent Features
(1)
Any credit rating below investment grade requires us to post the maximum amount of collateral.
We use fair value measurements to record fair value adjustments to certain assets and liabilities and to fulfill fair value disclosure requirements. Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, such as derivatives, residential MSRs, and trading or AFS debt securities, are presented in Table 12.1 in this Note. Additionally, from time to time, we record fair value adjustments on a nonrecurring basis. These nonrecurring adjustments typically involve application of an accounting method such as lower of cost or fair value (LOCOM) and the measurement alternative, or write-downs of individual assets. Assets recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring basis are presented in Table 12.4 in this Note. We provide in Table 12.9 estimates of fair value for financial instruments that are not recorded at fair value, such as loans and debt liabilities carried at amortized cost.
See Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) in our 2024 Form 10-K for a discussion of how we determine fair value. For descriptions of the valuation methodologies we use for assets and liabilities recorded at fair value on a recurring or nonrecurring basis, see Note 15 (Fair Value Measurements) in our 2024 Form 10-K.
FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY
We classify our assets and liabilities recorded at fair value as either Level 1, 2, or 3 in the fair value hierarchy. The highest priority (Level 1) is assigned to valuations based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and the lowest priority (Level 3) is assigned to valuations that include one or more significant unobservable inputs. See Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) in our 2024 Form 10-K for a detailed description of the fair value hierarchy.
In the determination of the classification of financial instruments in Level 2 or Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, we consider all available information, including observable market data, indications of market liquidity and orderliness of transactions, and our understanding of the valuation techniques and significant inputs used. This determination is ultimately based upon the specific facts and circumstances of each instrument or instrument category and judgments are made regarding the significance of the unobservable inputs to the instruments’ fair value measurement in its entirety. If one or more unobservable inputs is considered significant, the instrument is classified as Level 3.
We do not classify nonmarketable equity securities in the fair value hierarchy if we use the non-published net asset value (NAV) per share (or its equivalent) as a practical expedient to measure fair value. Marketable equity securities with published NAVs are classified in the fair value hierarchy.
Assets and Liabilities Recorded at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis
Table 12.1 presents the balances of assets and liabilities recorded at fair value on a recurring basis.

For additional information on the valuation techniques and significant unobservable inputs used in the valuation of our Level 3 assets and liabilities, including how changes in these inputs affect fair value estimates, see Note 15 (Fair Value Measurements) in our 2024 Form 10-K.
Note 12:
Fair Value Measurements
(continued)
Assets and Liabilities Recorded at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis
We may be required, from time to time, to measure certain assets at fair value on a nonrecurring basis in accordance with GAAP. These adjustments to fair value usually result from write-downs of individual assets or the application of an accounting method such as LOCOM and the measurement alternative.
Table 12.4 provides the fair value hierarchy and fair value at the date of the nonrecurring fair value adjustment for all assets that were still held as of March 31, 2025, and December 31, 2024, and for which a nonrecurring fair value adjustment was recorded during the quarter ended March 31, 2025, and the year ended December 31, 2024.
Table 12.4:
Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis

Consists of commercial mortgages and residential mortgage – first lien loans.
Table 12.5 presents the gains (losses) on all assets held at the end of the reporting periods presented for which a nonrecurring
fair value adjustment was recognized in earnings during the respective periods.

Table 12.6 provides quantitative information about the valuation techniques and significant unobservable inputs used in the valuation of our Level 3 assets that are measured at fair value on
a nonrecurring basis. Weighted averages of inputs for equity securities are calculated using carrying value prior to the nonrecurring fair value measurement.
Table 12.6:
Valuation Techniques – Nonrecurring Basis
(1)
See Note 15 (Fair Value Measurements) in our 2024 Form 10-K for additional information on the valuation technique(s) and significant unobservable inputs used in the valuation of Level 3 assets.
Fair Value Option
The fair value option is an irrevocable election, generally only permitted upon initial recognition of financial assets or liabilities, to measure eligible financial instruments at fair value with changes in fair value reflected in earnings. We may elect the fair value option to align the measurement model with how the financial assets or liabilities are managed or to reduce complexity or accounting asymmetry. Following is a discussion of the portfolios for which we elected the fair value option. For
additional information, including the basis for our fair value option elections, see Note 15 (Fair Value Measurements) in our 2024 Form 10-K.
Table 12.7 reflects differences between the fair value carrying amount of the assets and liabilities for which we have elected the fair value option and the contractual aggregate unpaid principal amount at maturity.
Table 12.7:
Fair Value Option
(1)
Nonaccrual loans and loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing included in LHFS for which we have elected the fair value option were insignificant at March 31, 2025, and December 31, 2024.
(2)
Includes zero coupon notes for which the aggregate unpaid principal amount reflects the contractual principal due at maturity.
Table 12.8 reflects amounts included in earnings related to initial measurement and subsequent changes in fair value, by income statement line item, for assets and liabilities for which the fair
value option was elected. Amounts recorded in net interest income are excluded from the table below.
Table 12.8:
Gains (Losses) on Changes in Fair Value Included in Earnings
For performing loans, instrument-specific credit risk gains or losses are derived principally by determining the change in fair value of the loans due to changes in the observable or implied credit spread. Credit spread is the market yield on the loans less the relevant risk-free benchmark interest rate. For nonperforming loans, we attribute all changes in fair value to instrument-specific credit risk. For LHFS accounted for under the fair value option, instrument-specific credit gains or losses were insignificant during the first quarter of both 2025 and 2024.
For interest-bearing deposits and long-term debt, instrument-specific credit risk gains or losses represent the impact of changes in fair value due to changes in our credit spread and are generally derived using observable secondary bond market information. These impacts are recorded within the debit valuation adjustments (DVA) in OCI. See Note 21 (Other Comprehensive Income) for additional information.
Note 12:

Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments
Table 12.9 presents a summary of fair value estimates for financial instruments that are not carried at fair value on a recurring basis. Some financial instruments are excluded from the scope of this table, such as certain insurance contracts, certain nonmarketable equity securities, and leases. This table also excludes assets and liabilities that are not financial instruments such as the value of the long-term relationships with our deposit, credit card and trust customers, MSRs, premises and equipment, goodwill and deferred taxes.
Loan commitments, standby letters of credit and commercial and similar letters of credit are not included in
Table 12.9. A reasonable estimate of the fair value of these instruments is the carrying value of deferred fees plus the allowance for unfunded credit commitments, which totaled $
621
million and $
546
million at March 31, 2025, and December 31, 2024, respectively.
The total of the fair value calculations presented does not represent, and should not be construed to represent, the underlying fair value of the Company.
Table 12.9:
Fair Value Estimates for Financial Instruments
(1)
Amounts consist of financial instruments for which carrying value approximates fair value.
(2)
Excludes lease financing, net of allowance for credit losses, of $
15.9
billion and $
16.2
billion at March 31, 2025, and December 31, 2024, respectively.
(3)
Excludes deposit liabilities with no defined or contractual maturity of $
1.2
trillion at both March 31, 2025, and December 31, 2024.

Excludes obligations under finance leases of $
15
million and $
16
million at March 31, 2025, and December 31, 2024, respectively.
Involvement with Variable Interest Entities (VIEs)
In the normal course of business, we enter into various types of on- and off-balance sheet transactions with special purpose entities (SPEs), which are corporations, trusts, limited liability companies or partnerships that are established for a limited purpose. SPEs are often formed in connection with securitization transactions whereby financial assets are transferred to an SPE. SPEs formed in connection with securitization transactions are generally considered variable interest entities (VIEs). The VIE may alter the risk profile of the asset by entering into derivative transactions or obtaining credit support, and issues various forms of interests in those assets to investors. When we transfer financial assets from our consolidated balance sheet to a VIE in connection with a securitization, we typically receive cash and sometimes other interests in the VIE as proceeds for the assets we transfer. In certain transactions with VIEs, we may retain the right to service the transferred assets and repurchase the transferred assets if the outstanding balance of the assets falls below the level at which the cost to service the assets exceed the benefits. In addition, we may purchase the right to service loans transferred to a VIE by a third party.
In connection with our securitization or other VIE activities, we have various forms of ongoing involvement with VIEs, which may include:
•
underwriting securities issued by VIEs and subsequently making markets in those securities;
•
providing credit enhancement on securities issued by VIEs through the use of letters of credit or financial guarantees;
•
entering into other derivative contracts with VIEs;
•
holding senior or subordinated interests in VIEs;
•
acting as servicer or investment manager for VIEs;
•
providing administrative or trustee services to VIEs; and
•
providing seller financing to VIEs.
Loan Sales and Securitization Activity
We periodically transfer consumer and commercial loans and other types of financial assets in securitization and whole loan sale transactions.
MORTGAGE LOANS SOLD TO GOVERNMENT SPONSORED ENTERPRISES AND TRANSACTIONS WITH GINNIE MAE.
In the normal course of business we sell residential and commercial mortgage loans to GSEs. These loans are generally transferred into securitizations sponsored by the GSEs, which provide certain credit guarantees to investors and servicers. We also transfer mortgage loans into securitization pools pursuant to Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA) guidelines which are insured by the FHA or guaranteed by the VA. Mortgage loans eligible for securitization with the GSEs or GNMA are considered conforming loans. The GSEs or GNMA design the structure of these securitizations, sponsor the involved VIEs, and have power over the activities most significant to the VIE.
We account for loans transferred in conforming mortgage loan securitization transactions as sales and do not consolidate the VIEs as we are not the primary beneficiary. In exchange for the transfer of loans, we typically receive securities issued by the VIEs which we sell to third parties for cash or hold for investment purposes as HTM or AFS securities. We also retain servicing rights on the transferred loans. As a servicer, we retain the option to repurchase loans from certain loan securitizations, which
becomes exercisable based on delinquency status such as when three scheduled loan payments are past due. When we have the unilateral option to repurchase a loan, we recognize the loan and a corresponding liability on our balance sheet regardless of our intent to repurchase the loan, and the loans remain pledged to the securitization. At both March 31, 2025, and December 31, 2024, we recorded assets and related liabilities of $
1.5
billion, where we did not exercise our option to repurchase eligible loans. We repurchased loans of $
97
million and $
90
million during the first quarter of 2025 and 2024, respectively.
Upon transfers of loans, we also provide indemnification for losses incurred due to material breaches of contractual representations and warranties as well as other recourse arrangements. At March 31, 2025, and December 31, 2024, our liability for these repurchase and recourse arrangements was $
189
million and $
188
million, respectively, and the maximum exposure to loss was $
13.5
billion and $
13.7
billion
at March 31, 2025, and December 31, 2024, respectively.
Substantially all residential servicing activity is related to assets transferred to GSE and GNMA securitizations. See Note 6 (Mortgage Banking Activities) for additional information about residential and commercial servicing rights, advances and servicing fees.
NONCONFORMING MORTGAGE LOAN SECURITIZATIONS.
In the normal course of business, we sell nonconforming mortgage loans in securitization transactions that we design and sponsor. Nonconforming mortgage loan securitizations do not involve a government credit guarantee, and accordingly, beneficial interest holders are subject to credit risk of the underlying assets held by the securitization VIE. We typically originate the transferred loans and account for the transfers as sales. We also typically retain the right to service the loans and may hold other beneficial interests issued by the VIE, such as debt securities held for investment purposes. We do not consolidate the VIE because the most significant decisions impacting the performance of the VIE are generally made by the special servicer or the controlling class security holder. For our residential nonconforming mortgage loan securitizations accounted for as sales, we either do not hold variable interests that we consider potentially significant or are not the primary servicer for a majority of the VIE assets.
WHOLE LOAN SALE TRANSACTIONS.
We may also sell whole loans to VIEs where we have continuing involvement in the form of financing. We account for these transfers as sales, and do not consolidate the VIEs as we do not have the power to direct the most significant activities of the VIEs.
Table 13.1 presents information about transfers of assets during the periods presented for which we recorded the transfers as sales and have continuing involvement with the transferred assets. In connection with these transfers, we received proceeds and recorded servicing assets and securities. Each of these interests are initially measured at fair value. Servicing rights are classified as Level 3 measurements, and generally securities are classified as Level 2. Transfers of residential mortgage loans are transactions with the GSEs or GNMA and generally result in
no
gain or loss because the loans are typically measured at fair value on a recurring basis. Transfers of commercial mortgage loans
Note 13:
Securitizations and Variable Interest Entities
(continued)
include both transactions with the GSEs or GNMA and nonconforming transactions. These commercial mortgage loans are carried at the lower of cost or market, and we recognize gains
on such transfers when the market value is greater than the carrying value of the loan when it is sold.
Table 13.1:
Transfers with Continuing Involvement

531
million and $
642
million during the quarters ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively.
In the normal course of business, we purchase certain non-agency securities at initial securitization or subsequently in the secondary market, which we hold for investment. We may also provide seller financing in the form of loans. During the quarters ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, for VIEs with significant continuing involvement, we received cash flows of $
6
million and $
158
million, respectively, related to principal and interest payments on these securities and loans. These amounts exclude cash flows related to trading activities.
Table 13.2 presents the key weighted-average assumptions we used to initially measure residential MSRs recognized during the periods presented.
Table 13.2:
Residential MSRs – Assumptions at Securitization Date
(1)
Includes a blend of prepayment speeds and expected defaults. Prepayment speeds are influenced by mortgage interest rates as well as our estimation of drivers of borrower behavior.
See Note 12 (Fair Value Measurements) and Note 6 (Mortgage Banking Activities) for additional information on key assumptions for residential MSRs.
RESECURITIZATION ACTIVITIES.
We enter into resecuritization transactions as part of our trading activities to accommodate the investment and risk management activities of our customers. In resecuritization transactions, we transfer trading debt securities to VIEs in exchange for new beneficial interests that are sold to third parties at or shortly after securitization settlement. This activity is performed for customers seeking a specific return or risk profile. Substantially all of our transactions involve the resecuritization of conforming mortgage-backed securities issued by the GSEs or guaranteed by GNMA. We do not consolidate the resecuritization VIEs as we share in the decision-making power with third parties and do not hold significant economic interests in the VIEs other than for market-making activities. During the quarters ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, we transferred trading debt securities of $
4.9
billion and $
2.7
billion, respectively, to resecuritization VIEs, and retained trading debt securities of $
575
million and $
229
million, respectively. These amounts are not included in Table 13.1. As of March 31, 2025, and December 31, 2024, we held $
1.1
billion and $
819
million of trading debt securities, respectively. Total resecuritization VIE assets, to which we sold assets and hold an interest, were $
49.8
billion and $
44.1
billion at March 31, 2025, and December 31, 2024, respectively.
Sold or Securitized Loans Serviced for Others
Table 13.3 presents information about loans that we have originated and sold or securitized in which we have ongoing involvement as servicer. For loans sold or securitized where servicing is our only form of continuing involvement, we generally experience a loss only if we were required to repurchase a delinquent loan or foreclosed asset due to a breach in representations and warranties associated with our loan sale or servicing contracts. Delinquent loans include loans 90 days or more past due and loans in bankruptcy, regardless of delinquency status.
Table 13.3 excludes mortgage loans sold to and held or securitized by GSEs or GNMA of $
527.7
billion and $
528.1
billion at March 31, 2025, and December 31, 2024, respectively, due to guarantees provided by GSEs and the FHA and VA, which limit our credit risk associated with such securitizations. Delinquent loans and foreclosed assets related to loans sold to and held or securitized by GSEs and GNMA were $
2.2
billion and $
2.4
billion at March 31, 2025, and December 31, 2024, respectively.
Table 13.3:
Sold or Securitized Loans Serviced for Others
(1)
Includes $
0
million and $
258
million of commercial foreclosed assets and $
24
million and $
18
million of residential foreclosed assets at March 31, 2025, and December 31, 2024, respectively.

In first quarter 2025, we sold the non-agency portion of our commercial mortgage third-party servicing business.
Transactions with Unconsolidated VIEs
MORTGAGE LOAN SECURITIZATIONS.
Table 13.4 includes nonconforming mortgage loan securitizations where we originate and transfer the loans to the unconsolidated securitization VIEs that we sponsor. For additional information about these VIEs, see the “Loan Sales and Securitization Activity” section within this Note.
Conforming loan securitization and resecuritization transactions involving the GSEs and GNMA are excluded from Table 13.4 because we are not the sponsor or we do not have power over the activities most significant to the VIEs. Additionally, due to the nature of the guarantees provided by the GSEs and the FHA and VA, our credit risk associated with these VIEs is limited. For additional information about conforming mortgage loan securitizations and resecuritizations, see the “Loan Sales and Securitization Activity” and “Resecuritization Activities” sections within this Note.
COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE LOANS.
We may transfer purchased industrial development bonds and GSE credit enhancements to VIEs in exchange for beneficial interests. We may also acquire such beneficial interests in transactions where we do not act as a transferor. We own all of the beneficial interests and may also service the underlying mortgages that serve as collateral to the bonds. The GSEs have the power to direct the servicing and workout activities of the VIE in the event of a default, therefore we do not have control over the key decisions of the VIEs.
OTHER VIE STRUCTURES.
We engage in various forms of structured finance arrangements with other VIEs, including asset-backed finance structures. Collateral may include rental properties and mortgage loans. We may participate in structuring or marketing the arrangements as well as provide financing, service one or more of the underlying assets, or enter into derivatives with the VIEs. We may also receive fees for those services. We are not the primary beneficiary of these structures because we do not have power to direct the most significant activities of the VIEs.
Note 13:
Securitizations and Variable Interest Entities
(continued)
Table 13.4 provides a summary of our exposure to the unconsolidated VIEs described above, which includes investments in securities, loans, guarantees, liquidity agreements, commitments and certain derivatives. We exclude certain transactions with unconsolidated VIEs when our continuing involvement is temporary or administrative in nature or insignificant in size.
In Table 13.4, “Total VIE assets” represents the remaining principal balance of assets held by unconsolidated VIEs using the most current information available. “Carrying value” is the amount in our consolidated balance sheet related to our involvement with the unconsolidated VIEs. “Maximum exposure to loss” is determined as the carrying value of our investment in the VIEs excluding the unconditional repurchase options that have not been exercised, plus the remaining undrawn liquidity
and lending commitments, the notional amount of net written derivative contracts, and generally the notional amount of, or stressed loss estimate for, other commitments and guarantees.
Debt, guarantees and other commitments include amounts related to lending arrangements, liquidity agreements, and certain loss sharing obligations associated with loans originated, sold, and serviced under certain GSE programs.
“Maximum exposure to loss” represents estimated loss that would be incurred under severe, hypothetical circumstances, for which we believe the possibility is extremely remote, such as where the value of our interests and any associated collateral declines to zero, without any consideration of recovery or offset from any economic hedges. Accordingly, this disclosure is not an indication of expected loss.
Table 13.4:
Unconsolidated VIEs
(1)
Includes $
3
million and $
298
million of securities classified as trading at March 31, 2025, and December 31, 2024, respectively.
(2)
All other assets includes mortgage servicing rights, derivative assets, and other assets. Other assets at December 31, 2024, were predominantly servicer advances.
(3)
In first quarter 2025, we sold the non-agency portion of our commercial mortgage third-party servicing business. As a result, we no longer have continuing involvement in the form of servicing.
INVOLVEMENT WITH TAX CREDIT VIES.
In addition to the unconsolidated VIEs in Table 13.4, we may invest in or provide funding to affordable housing, renewable energy or similar projects that are designed to generate a return primarily through the realization of federal income tax credits and other income tax benefits. Our affordable housing investments generate low-income housing tax credits and our renewable energy investments generate either production tax credits, investment tax credits, or both. The projects are typically managed by third-party sponsors who have the power over the VIE’s assets; therefore, we do not consolidate the VIEs. The carrying value of our equity investments in tax credit VIEs was $
21.1
billion and $
21.7
billion at March 31, 2025, and December 31, 2024, respectively. Additionally, we had loans to tax credit VIEs with a carrying value of $
2.0
billion and $
1.9
billion at March 31, 2025, and December 31, 2024, respectively.
Our maximum exposure to loss for tax credit VIEs at March 31, 2025, and December 31, 2024, was $
28.5
billion and $
29.1
billion, respectively. Our maximum exposure to loss included total unfunded equity and lending commitments of $
5.5
billion at both March 31, 2025, and December 31, 2024.
Under these commitments, we are required to provide additional financial support during the investment period, at the discretion of project sponsors, or for certain renewable energy investments, on a contingent basis based on the amount of income tax credits earned. For equity investments accounted for using the proportional amortization method, a liability is recognized in accrued expenses and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet for unfunded commitments that are either legally binding or contingent but probable of funding. The liability recognized for these commitments at March 31, 2025, and December 31, 2024, was $
5.8
billion and $
6.4
billion, respectively. Substantially all of these commitments are expected to be funded within
three years
. See Note 14 (Guarantees and Other Commitments) for additional information about unrecognized commitments to purchase equity securities.
Table 13.5 summarizes the impacts to our consolidated statement of income related to our affordable housing and renewable energy equity investments, which are accounted for using either the proportional amortization method or the equity method.
Table 13.5:
Income Statement Impacts for Affordable Housing and Renewable Energy Tax Credit Investments
(1)
Includes pre-tax impacts from tax credit investments accounted for using the equity method and non-income tax-related returns from investments accounted for using the proportional amortization method.
Note 13:
Securitizations and Variable Interest Entities
(continued)
Consolidated VIEs
We consolidate VIEs where we are the primary beneficiary. We are the primary beneficiary of the following structure types:
COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL LOANS AND LEASES.
We previously securitized dealer floor plan loans in a revolving master trust entity. As servicer and holder of all beneficial interests, we control the key decisions of the trust and consolidate the VIE. In first quarter 2024, we removed the loans held by the master trust entity by transferring them to another subsidiary of Wells Fargo, which had no impact on our consolidated balance sheet. In a separate transaction structure, we may provide the majority of debt and equity financing to an SPE that engages in lending and leasing to specific vendors and we service the underlying collateral.
CREDIT CARD SECURITIZATIONS.
Beginning in first quarter 2024, we securitized a portion of our credit card loans to provide a source of funding. Credit card securitizations involve the transfer of credit card loans to a master trust that issues debt securities to third party investors that are collateralized by the transferred credit card loans. The underlying securitized credit card loans and other assets in the master trust are available only for payment of the debt securities issued by the master trust; they are not available to pay our other obligations. In addition, the investors in the debt securities do not have recourse to the general credit of Wells Fargo.
We consolidate the master trust because, as the servicer of the credit card loans, we have the power to direct the activities that
most significantly impact the economic performance and hold variable interests potentially significant to the VIE. We hold a minimum of
5
% seller’s interest in the transferred credit card loans and we retain subordinated securities issued by the master trust, which collectively could result in exposure to potentially significant losses or benefits from the master trust. As of March 31, 2025, and December 31, 2024, we held seller’s interest of $
6.1
billion and $
6.5
billion, respectively, in the transferred credit card loans and subordinated securities of $
750
million (at par) in both periods issued by the master trust, which are both eliminated in our consolidated financial statements. The transferred credit card loans and debt securities issued to third parties are recognized on our consolidated balance sheet, and classified as loans and long-term debt, respectively.
Table 13.6 presents a summary of financial assets and liabilities of our consolidated VIEs. The carrying value represents assets and liabilities recognized on our consolidated balance sheet. “Total VIE assets” includes affiliate balances that are eliminated upon consolidation, and therefore in some instances will differ from the carrying value of assets.
On our consolidated balance sheet, we separately disclose (1) the consolidated assets of certain VIEs that can only be used to settle the liabilities of those VIEs, and (2) the consolidated liabilities of certain VIEs for which the VIE creditors do not have recourse to Wells Fargo.
Table 13.6:
Transactions with Consolidated VIEs
(1)
All other assets includes loans held for sale and other assets.
Other Transactions
In addition to the transactions included in the previous tables, we have used wholly-owned trust preferred security VIEs to issue debt securities or preferred equity exclusively to third-party investors. As the sole assets of the VIEs are receivables from us, we do not consolidate the VIEs even though we own all of the voting equity shares of the VIEs, have fully guaranteed the obligations of the VIEs, and may have the right to redeem the third-party securities under certain circumstances. On our consolidated balance sheet, we reported the debt securities issued to the VIEs as long-term junior subordinated debt with a carrying value of $
432
million and $
429
million at March 31, 2025, and December 31, 2024, respectively.
Guarantees are contracts that contingently require us to make payments to a guaranteed party based on an event or a change in an underlying asset, liability, rate or index. For additional
descriptions of our guarantees, see Note 17 (Guarantees and Other Commitments) in our 2024 Form 10-K.
Table 14.1 shows carrying value and maximum exposure to loss on our guarantees.
Table 14.1:
Guarantees – Carrying Value and Maximum Exposure to Loss
(1)
Standby and direct pay letters of credit are reported net of syndications and participations.
Maximum exposure to loss represents the estimated loss that would be incurred under an assumed hypothetical circumstance, despite what we believe is a remote possibility, where the value of our interests and any associated collateral declines to zero. Maximum exposure to loss estimates in Table 14.1 do not reflect economic hedges or collateral we could use to offset or recover losses we may incur under our guarantee agreements. Accordingly, these amounts are not an indication of expected loss. We believe the carrying value is more representative of our current exposure to loss than maximum exposure to loss. The carrying value represents the fair value of the guarantee, if any, and also includes an ACL for guarantees, if applicable. In determining the ACL for guarantees, we consider the credit risk of the related contingent obligation.
For our guarantees in Table 14.1, non-investment grade represents those guarantees on which we have a higher risk of performance under the terms of the guarantee, which is determined based on an external rating or an internal credit grade that is below investment grade, if applicable.
WRITTEN OPTIONS.
We enter into written foreign currency options and over-the-counter written equity put options that are derivative contracts that have the characteristics of a guarantee. The fair value of written options represents our view of the probability that we will be required to perform under the contract. The fair value of these written options was a liability of $
122
million and $
88
million at March 31, 2025, and December 31, 2024, respectively. The fair value may be an asset as a result of deferred premiums on certain option trades. The maximum exposure to loss represents the notional value of these derivative contracts. At March 31, 2025, the maximum exposure to loss was $
56.4
billion, with $
53.2
billion expiring in three years or less compared with $
34.3
billion and $
31.5
billion,
respectively, at December 31, 2024. See Note 11 (Derivatives) for additional information regarding written derivative contracts.
MERCHANT PROCESSING SERVICES.
We provide debit and credit card transaction processing services through payment networks directly for merchants and as a sponsor for merchant processing servicers, including our joint venture with a third party that is accounted for as an equity method investment. In our role as the merchant acquiring bank, we have a potential obligation in connection with payment and delivery disputes between the merchant and the cardholder that are resolved in favor of the cardholder, referred to as a charge-back transaction. We estimate our potential maximum exposure to be the total merchant transaction volume processed in the preceding four months, which is generally the lifecycle for a charge-back transaction. As of March 31, 2025, our potential maximum exposure was approximately $
430.5
billion, and related losses, including those from our joint venture entity, were insignificant.
GUARANTEES OF SUBSIDIARIES.
The Parent fully and unconditionally guarantees the payment of principal, interest, and any other amounts that may be due on securities that its 100% owned finance subsidiary, Wells Fargo Finance LLC, may issue.
These securities are not guaranteed by any other subsidiary of the Parent. The guaranteed liabilities were $
1.3
billion at both March 31, 2025, and December 31, 2024. These guarantees rank on parity with all of the Parent’s other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness.
Note 14:
Guarantees and Other Commitments
(continued)
OTHER COMMITMENTS.
As of March 31, 2025, and December 31, 2024, we had commitments to purchase equity securities of $
6.8
billion and $
6.6
billion, respectively, which predominantly included Federal Reserve Bank stock and tax credit investments accounted for using the equity method.
We have commitments to enter into resale and securities borrowing agreements as well as repurchase and securities lending agreements with certain counterparties, including central clearing organizations. The amount of our unfunded contractual commitments for resale and securities borrowing agreements was $
41.7
billion and $
27.3
billion as of March 31, 2025, and December 31, 2024, respectively. The amount of our unfunded contractual commitments for repurchase and securities lending agreements was $
2.8
billion and $
2.0
billion as of March 31, 2025, and December 31, 2024, respectively.
Given the nature of these commitments, they are excluded from Table 5.4 (Unfunded Credit Commitments) in Note 5 (Loans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses).
We enter into resale and repurchase agreements and securities borrowing and lending agreements (collectively, “securities financing activities”) typically to finance trading positions (including securities and derivatives), acquire securities to cover short trading positions, accommodate customers’ financing needs, and settle other securities obligations. These activities are conducted through our broker-dealer subsidiaries and, to a lesser extent, through other bank entities. Our securities financing activities predominantly involve high-quality, liquid securities such as U.S. Treasury securities and government agency securities and, to a lesser extent, less liquid securities, including equity securities, corporate bonds and asset-backed securities. We account for these transactions as collateralized financings in which we typically receive or pledge securities as collateral. We believe these financing transactions generally do not have material credit risk given the collateral provided and the related monitoring processes.
OFFSETTING OF SECURITIES FINANCING ACTIVITIES.
Table 15.1 presents resale and repurchase agreements subject to master repurchase agreements (MRA) and securities borrowing and lending agreements subject to master securities lending agreements (MSLA). Where legally enforceable, these master netting arrangements give the ability, in the event of default by the counterparty, to liquidate securities held as collateral and to offset receivables and payables with the same counterparty.
Securities financings with the same counterparty are presented net on our consolidated balance sheet, provided certain criteria are met that permit balance sheet netting. The majority of transactions subject to these agreements do not meet those criteria and thus are not eligible for balance sheet netting.
Securities collateral we pledge is not netted on our consolidated balance sheet against the related liability. Securities collateral we receive is not recognized on our consolidated balance sheet. Collateral pledged or received may be increased or decreased over time to maintain certain contractual thresholds, as the assets underlying each arrangement fluctuate in value. For additional information on collateral pledged and received, see Note 16 (Pledged Assets and Collateral). Generally, these agreements require collateral to exceed the asset or liability recognized on the balance sheet. The following table includes the amount of collateral pledged or received related to exposures subject to enforceable MRAs or MSLAs. While these agreements are typically over-collateralized, the disclosure in this table is limited to the reported amount of such collateral to the amount of the related recognized asset or liability for each counterparty.
In addition to the amounts included in Table 15.1, we also have balance sheet netting related to derivatives that is disclosed in Note 11 (Derivatives).
Table 15.1:
Offsetting – Securities Financing Activities
(1)
Represents recognized amount of resale and repurchase agreements with counterparties subject to enforceable MRAs that have been offset within our consolidated balance sheet.
(2)
Included in federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements on our consolidated balance sheet. Excludes $
22.3
billion and $
21.8
billion classified on our consolidated balance sheet in loans at March 31, 2025, and December 31, 2024, respectively, which relates to resale agreements involving collateral other than securities as part of our commercial lending business activities.
(3)
Represents the fair value of collateral we have received under enforceable MRAs or MSLAs, limited in the table above to the amount of the recognized asset due from each counterparty.
(4)
Represents the amount of our exposure (assets) or obligation (liabilities) that is not collateralized and/or is not subject to an enforceable MRA or MSLA.
(5)
Included in short-term borrowings on our consolidated balance sheet.
(6)
Represents the fair value of collateral we have pledged, related to enforceable MRAs or MSLAs, limited in the table above to the amount of the recognized liability owed to each counterparty.
Note 15:
Securities Financing Activities
(continued)
REPURCHASE AND SECURITIES LENDING AGREEMENTS.
Securities sold under repurchase agreements and securities lending arrangements are effectively short-term collateralized borrowings. In these transactions, we receive cash in exchange for transferring securities as collateral and recognize an obligation to reacquire the securities for cash at the transaction’s maturity. These types of transactions create risks, including (1) the counterparty may fail to return the securities at maturity, (2) the fair value of the securities transferred may decline below the amount of our obligation to reacquire the securities, and therefore create an obligation for us to pledge additional amounts, and (3) the counterparty may accelerate the maturity
on demand, requiring us to reacquire the security prior to contractual maturity. We attempt to mitigate these risks in various ways. Our collateral predominantly consists of highly liquid securities. In addition, we underwrite and monitor the financial strength of our counterparties, monitor the fair value of collateral pledged relative to contractually required repurchase amounts, and monitor that our collateral is properly returned through the clearing and settlement process in advance of our cash repayment.
Table 15.2 provides the gross amounts recognized on our consolidated balance sheet (before the effects of offsetting) of our liabilities for repurchase and securities lending agreements disaggregated by underlying collateral type.
Table 15.2:
Gross Obligations by Underlying Collateral Type
Table 15.3 provides the contractual maturities of our gross obligations under repurchase and securities lending agreements. Securities lending is executed under agreements that allow either party to terminate the transaction without notice, while repurchase agreements have a term structure that matures at a point in time. The overnight agreements require an election by both parties to roll the trade, while continuous agreements require an election by either party to terminate the agreement.
Table 15.3:
Contractual Maturities of Gross Obligations
Pledged Assets
We pledge financial assets that we own to counterparties for the collateralization of securities and other collateralized financing activities, to secure trust and public deposits, and to collateralize derivative contracts. See Note 15 (Securities Financing Activities) for additional information on securities financing activities. As part of our liquidity management strategy, we may also pledge assets to secure borrowings and letters of credit from Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLBs), to maintain potential borrowing capacity with FHLBs and at the discount window of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (FRB), and for other purposes as required or permitted by law or insurance statutory requirements. The collateral that we pledge may include our own collateral as well as collateral that we have received from third parties and have the right to repledge.
Table 16.1 provides the carrying values of assets recognized on our consolidated balance sheet that we have pledged to third parties. Assets pledged in transactions where our counterparty has the right to sell or repledge those assets are presented parenthetically on our consolidated balance sheet.
VIE RELATED.
We also pledge assets in connection with various types of transactions entered into with VIEs, which are excluded from Table 16.1. These pledged assets can only be used to settle the liabilities of those entities. We also have loans recorded on our consolidated balance sheet which represent certain delinquent loans that are eligible for repurchase from GNMA loan securitizations. See Note 13 (Securitizations and Variable Interest Entities) for additional information on consolidated and unconsolidated VIE assets.
Table 16.1:
Pledged Assets
Collateral Accepted
We receive financial assets as collateral that we are permitted to sell or repledge. This collateral is obtained in connection with securities purchased under resale agreements and securities borrowing transactions, customer margin loans, and derivative contracts. We may use this collateral in connection with securities sold under repurchase agreements and securities lending transactions, derivative contracts, and short sales. At March 31, 2025, and December 31, 2024, the fair value of this collateral received that we have the right to sell or repledge was $
314.8
billion and $
288.7
billion, respectively, of which $
175.9
billion and $
142.2
billion, respectively, were sold or repledged.
Our management reporting is organized into
four
reportable operating segments: Consumer Banking and Lending; Commercial Banking; Corporate and Investment Banking; and Wealth and Investment Management. All other business activities that are not included in the reportable operating segments have been included in Corporate. We define our reportable operating segments by type of product and customer segment, and their results are based on our management reporting process. The management reporting process measures the performance of the reportable operating segments based on the Company’s management structure, and the results are regularly reviewed with our Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and relevant senior management. Our CEO is the chief operating decision maker (CODM) and reviews actual and forecasted operating segment net income for assessing performance and deciding how to allocate resources. The management reporting process is based on U.S. GAAP and includes specific adjustments, such as funds transfer pricing for asset/liability management, shared revenue and expenses, and taxable-equivalent adjustments to consistently reflect income from taxable and tax-exempt sources, which allows management to assess performance consistently across the operating segments.
Consumer Banking and Lending
offers diversified financial products and services for consumers and small businesses with annual sales generally up to $
10
million. These financial products and services include checking and savings accounts, credit and debit cards as well as home, auto, personal, and small business lending.
Commercial Banking
provides financial solutions to private, family owned and certain public companies. Products and services include banking and credit products across multiple industry sectors and municipalities, secured lending and lease products, and treasury management.
Corporate and Investment Banking
delivers a suite of capital markets, banking, and financial products and services to corporate, commercial real estate, government and institutional clients globally. Products and services include corporate banking, investment banking, treasury management, commercial real estate lending and servicing, equity and fixed income solutions as well as sales, trading, and research capabilities.
Wealth and Investment Management
provides personalized wealth management, brokerage, financial planning, lending, private banking, trust and fiduciary products and services to affluent, high-net worth and ultra-high-net worth clients. We operate through financial advisors in our brokerage and wealth offices, consumer bank branches, independent offices, and digitally through WellsTrade
®
and Intuitive Investor
®.
Corporate
includes corporate treasury and enterprise functions, net of expense allocations, in support of the reportable operating segments (including funds transfer pricing, capital, and liquidity), as well as our investment portfolio and venture capital and private equity investments. Corporate also includes certain lines of business that management has determined are no longer consistent with the long-term strategic goals of the Company as well as results for previously divested businesses.
Basis of Presentation
FUNDS TRANSFER PRICING.
Corporate treasury manages a funds transfer pricing methodology that considers interest rate risk, liquidity risk, and other product characteristics. Operating segments pay a funding charge for their assets and receive a funding credit for their deposits, both of which are included in net interest income. The net impact of the funding charges or credits is recognized in corporate treasury.
REVENUE SHARING AND EXPENSE ALLOCATIONS.
When lines of business jointly serve customers, the line of business that is responsible for providing the product or service recognizes revenue or expense with a referral fee paid or an allocation of cost to the other line of business based on established internal revenue-sharing agreements.
When a line of business uses a service provided by another line of business, expense is generally allocated based on the cost and use of the service provided. Enterprise functions, such as operations, technology, and risk management, are included in Corporate with an allocation of their applicable costs to the reportable operating segments based on the level of support provided by the enterprise function. We periodically assess and update our revenue sharing and expense allocation methodologies.
Table 17.1 includes the allocated expenses from Corporate to the reportable operating segments within the relevant personnel and non-personnel expense lines. Personnel expense is a significant expense for our reportable operating segments. Non-personnel expense includes other expense categories that are consistent with those presented in our consolidated statement of income, such as technology, telecommunications and equipment expense, occupancy expense, and professional and outside services expense.
TAXABLE-EQUIVALENT ADJUSTMENTS.
Taxable-equivalent adjustments related to tax-exempt income on certain loans and debt securities are included in net interest income, while taxable-equivalent adjustments related to income tax credits for affordable housing and renewable energy investments are included in noninterest income, in each case with corresponding impacts to income tax expense (benefit). Adjustments are included in Corporate, Commercial Banking, and Corporate and Investment Banking and are eliminated to reconcile to the Company’s consolidated financial results.
Table 17.1 presents our results by operating segment.
Table 17.1:
Operating Segments
(1)
Taxable-equivalent adjustments related to tax-exempt income on certain loans and debt securities are included in net interest income, while taxable-equivalent adjustments related to income tax credits for affordable housing and renewable energy investments are included in noninterest income, in each case with corresponding impacts to income tax expense (benefit). Adjustments are included in Corporate, Commercial Banking, and Corporate and Investment Banking and are eliminated to reconcile to the Company’s consolidated financial results.
(2)
Net interest income is interest earned on assets minus the interest paid on liabilities to fund those assets. Segment interest earned includes actual interest income on segment assets as well as a funding credit for their deposits. Segment interest paid on liabilities includes actual interest expense on segment liabilities as well as a funding charge for their assets
.
Revenue
Our revenue includes net interest income on financial instruments and noninterest income.
Table 18.1 presents our
revenue by operating segment. For additional description of our
operating segments, including additional financial information
and the underlying management accounting process, see
Note 17 (Operating Segments). For a description of our revenue from contracts with customers, see Note 21 (Revenue and Expenses) in our 2024 Form 10-K.

Expenses
OPERATING LOSSES.
Operating losses consist of expenses related to:
•
Legal actions such as litigation and regulatory matters. For additional information on legal actions, see Note 10 (Legal Actions);
•
Customer remediation activities, which are associated with our efforts to identify areas or instances where customers may have experienced financial harm and provide remediation as appropriate. We have accrued for the probable and estimable costs related to our customer remediation activities. We had $
188
million and $
236
million of accrued liabilities for customer remediation activities as of March 31, 2025, and December 31, 2024, respectively. Amounts may change based on additional facts and information, as well as ongoing reviews and communications with our regulators; and
•
Other business activities such as deposit overdraft losses, fraud losses, and isolated instances of customer redress.
Table 18.2 provides the components of our operating losses included in our consolidated statement of income.
Table 18.2:
Operating Losses
Operating losses may have significant variability given the inherent and unpredictable nature of legal actions and customer remediation activities. The timing and determination of the amount of any associated losses for these matters depends on a variety of factors, some of which are outside of our control.
OTHER EXPENSES.
Regulatory Charges and Assessments expense, which is included in other noninterest expense, was $
303
million in first quarter 2025, compared with $
551
million in the same period a year ago, and predominantly consisted of Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) deposit assessment expense, including amounts for the FDIC special assessment. For additional information on the FDIC special assessment, see Note 21 (Revenue and Expenses) in our 2024 Form 10-K.
Pension and Postretirement Plans
We sponsor a frozen noncontributory qualified defined benefit retirement plan, the Wells Fargo & Company Cash Balance Plan (Cash Balance Plan), which covers eligible employees of Wells Fargo. The Cash Balance Plan was frozen on July 1, 2009, and
no
new benefits accrue after that date. For additional information on our pension and postretirement plans, including plan assumptions, investment strategy and asset allocation, projected benefit payments, and valuation methodologies used
for assets measured at fair value, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) and Note 22 (Employee Benefits) in our 2024 Form 10-K.

Regulatory Capital Requirements
The Company and each of its subsidiary banks are subject to regulatory capital adequacy requirements promulgated by federal banking regulators. The FRB establishes capital requirements for the consolidated financial holding company, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) has similar requirements for the Company’s national banks, including Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (the Bank).
Table 22.1 presents regulatory capital information for the Company and the Bank in accordance with Basel III capital
requirements. We must calculate our risk-based capital ratios under both the Standardized and Advanced Approaches. The Standardized Approach applies assigned risk weights to broad risk categories, while the calculation of risk-weighted assets (RWAs) under the Advanced Approach differs by requiring applicable banks to utilize a risk-sensitive methodology, which relies upon the use of internal credit models, and includes an operational risk component.
Table 22.1:
Regulatory Capital Information
*
Denotes the binding ratio under the Standardized and Advanced Approaches at March 31, 2025.
(1)
Adjusted average assets consists of total quarterly average assets less goodwill and other permitted Tier 1 capital deductions. The Tier 1 leverage ratio consists of Tier 1 capital divided by total quarterly average assets, excluding goodwill and certain other items as determined under capital rule requirements.
(2)
The supplementary leverage ratio consists of Tier 1 capital divided by total leverage exposure. Total leverage exposure consists of total consolidated assets adjusted for certain off-balance sheet exposures, goodwill, and other permitted Tier 1 capital deductions.
At March 31, 2025, the Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1), Tier 1 and Total capital ratio requirements for the Company included a global systemically important bank (G-SIB) surcharge of
1.50
% and a countercyclical buffer of
0.00
%. In addition, these ratios included a stress capital buffer of
3.80
% under the Standardized Approach and a capital conservation buffer of
2.50
% under the Advanced Approach. The Company is required to maintain these risk-based capital ratios and to maintain a supplementary leverage ratio (SLR) that included a supplementary leverage buffer of
2.00
% to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments. The CET1, Tier 1 and Total capital ratio requirements for the Bank included a capital conservation buffer of
2.50
% under both the Standardized and Advanced
Approaches. The G-SIB surcharge and countercyclical buffer are not applicable to the Bank. At March 31, 2025, the Bank and our other insured depository institutions were considered well-capitalized under the requirements of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act.
Capital Planning Requirements
The FRB’s capital plan rule establishes capital planning and other requirements that govern capital distributions, including dividends and share repurchases, by certain large bank holding companies (BHCs), including Wells Fargo. The FRB conducts an annual Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review exercise and has also published guidance regarding its supervisory
expectations for capital planning, including capital policies regarding the process relating to common stock dividend and repurchase decisions in the FRB’s SR Letter 15-18. The Parent’s ability to make certain capital distributions is subject to the requirements of the capital plan rule and is also subject to the Parent meeting or exceeding certain regulatory capital minimums.
Loan and Dividend Restrictions
Federal law restricts the amount and the terms of both credit and non-credit transactions between a bank and its nonbank affiliates. Additionally, federal laws and regulations limit, and
regulators can impose additional limitations on, the dividends
that a national bank may pay.
Our nonbank subsidiaries are also limited by certain federal and state statutory provisions and regulations covering the amount of dividends that may be paid in any given year. In addition, we have entered into a Support Agreement dated June 28, 2017, as amended and restated on June 26, 2019, among Wells Fargo & Company, the parent holding company (Parent), WFC Holdings, LLC, an intermediate holding company and subsidiary of the Parent (IHC), the Bank, Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Wells Fargo Clearing Services, LLC, and certain other subsidiaries of the Parent designated from time to time as material entities for resolution planning purposes or identified from time to time as related support entities in our resolution plan, pursuant to which the IHC may be restricted from making dividend payments to the Parent if certain liquidity and/or capital metrics fall below defined triggers or if the Parent’s board of directors authorizes it to file a case under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.
For additional information on loan and dividend restrictions, see Note 26 (Regulatory Capital Requirements and Other Restrictions) in our 2024 Form 10-K.
Cash Restrictions

Disclosure Pursuant to Section 13(r) of the Exchange Act
Pursuant to Section 13(r) of the Exchange Act, an issuer is required to disclose in its annual or quarterly reports, as applicable, whether it or any of its affiliates knowingly engaged in certain activities, transactions or dealings relating to the Government of Iran or with certain individuals or entities that are the subject of sanctions under U.S. law. Disclosure may be required even where the activities, transactions or dealings were conducted in compliance with applicable law.
In first quarter 2025, the Company identified, as well as blocked and reported to the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), accounts held by certain consumer customers who the Company determined met the OFAC definition of the “Government of Iran” because of their employment at entities owned by the Government of Iran. During the quarter, before the accounts were closed and the funds, if any, were moved to a blocked account, there was some regular consumer activity in
certain
of the accounts, including customer deposits, withdrawals, and payments, and account maintenance activities. The Company’s gross revenue attributable to these accounts in first quarter 2025 was de minimis. The Company does not intend to engage in further activity with these accounts.
